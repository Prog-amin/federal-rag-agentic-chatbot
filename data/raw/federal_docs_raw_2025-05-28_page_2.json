AD 2020-06-13 requires determining the accumulated hours time-in-service (TIS) of certain part-numbered main gearbox (MGB) suspension bar rear attachment fittings (fittings) and bolts and establishes reduced life limits. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-06-13, it was determined that modifying the MGB suspension bar fittings link and installing improved MGB suspension bar fitting bolts are necessary. This proposed AD would require modifying the MGB suspension bar link, installing newly- designed bolts, and prohibit installing certain parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
