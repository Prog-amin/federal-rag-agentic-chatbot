The agencies did not propose any postponements of disclosure in the records related to incident 2024-003-066. NARA, the Department of Justice, and the FBI proposed 559 postponements in the records related to the other two incidents. The FBI later withdrew 44 of the postponements the Bureau proposed. On May 9, 2025 and May 16, 2025, the Review Board met and approved 161 postponements and portions of 33 additional postponements, and determined that 354 pages in full and 64 pages in part should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.",

This proposed change is being made to be consistent with the methodology used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) consistent with CHGME Payment Program's long-standing practice of using the same methodology in calculating FTE counts as CMS does in Medicare GME and to minimize administrative burden on hospital who participate in both programs. This notice summarizes and responds to the comments received during the 30-day comment period.",

Under this proposal, all laboratories, whether federal or not, would have the same compliance dates, which would be aligned with current compliance dates for Federal agencies and Federal contractors. EPA is proposing to extend the compliance dates for associated laboratory activities detailed in this proposal to avoid disruption of important functions such as the use of environmental monitoring methods needed for cleanup sites and wastewater treatment, as well as activities associated with university laboratories. The use of environmental monitoring methods, a common function of non-federal laboratories, is important to EPA's mission to ensure that the air is safe to breathe, water is safe for drinking or recreating, and disposal activities protect the environment.",
