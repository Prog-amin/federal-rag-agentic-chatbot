      "abstract": "The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-19-13, which applies to certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. AD 2019-19-13 requires determining the total hours time- in-service (TIS) of the free wheel shafts of certain main rotor gearboxes (MGBs), replacing the MGB or right-hand side (RH) free wheel shaft, installing placard(s), and revising the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for the helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-19-13, an additional part-numbered MGB has been identified to have the same unsafe condition and the FAA determined that additional changes are necessary. This proposed AD would require the actions of AD 2019-19-13 and, expand the applicability by adding the additional part-numbered MGB, change the requirement to determine the total hours TIS of a certain free wheel shaft, require repetitive replacement of the MGB or the RH free wheel shaft, change the requirements for who can replace parts, and expand the parts installation limitation conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

Under these regulations, among other requirements, a covered financial institution is prohibited from establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing correspondent accounts in the United States for or on behalf of a foreign shell bank. The regulations require that a covered financial institution take reasonable steps to ensure that any correspondent account that it establishes, maintains, administers, or manages in the United States for a foreign bank is not used by the foreign bank to indirectly provide banking services to a foreign shell bank. The regulations also mandate that a covered financial institution that maintains a correspondent account in the United States for a foreign bank retain records in the United States identifying the owners of each such foreign bank whose shares are not publicly traded, unless the foreign bank files a Form FR-Y with the Federal Reserve Board identifying the current owners of the foreign bank, and the name and street address of a person who resides in the United States and is authorized, and has agreed to be an agent to accept service of legal process for records regarding each such correspondent account. This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.",

The project has been delayed by 1 year and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The initial IHA was effective from June 1, 2024 through May 31, 2025. The Haines Borough has requested reissuance with new effective dates of June 1, 2025 through May 31, 2026. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.",
