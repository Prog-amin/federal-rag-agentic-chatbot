This proposed AD would require a detailed visual inspection of the interface pin of the HSTA to determine if the interface pin is incorrectly installed, and applicable on-condition actions as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR).

This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the Fish Lake Valley tui chub.
