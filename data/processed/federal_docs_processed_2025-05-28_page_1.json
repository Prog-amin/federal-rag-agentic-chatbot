Abstract\n\n    The Economic Development Administration (EDA) leads the Federal \neconomic development agenda by promoting innovation and \ncompetitiveness, preparing American regions for growth and success in \nthe worldwide economy. Guided by the basic principle that sustainable \neconomic development should be driven locally, EDA works directly with \ncommunities and regions to help them build the capacity for economic \ndevelopment based on local business conditions and needs. The Public \nWorks and Economic Development Act of 1965 (PWEDA) (42 U.S.C. 3121 et \nseq.) is EDA's organic authority and is the primary legal authority \nunder which EDA awards financial assistance. Under PWEDA, EDA provides \nfinancial assistance to both rural and urban distressed communities by \nfostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and productivity through \ninvestments in infrastructure development, capacity building, and \nbusiness development to attract private capital investments and new and \nbetter jobs to regions experiencing economic distress. Further \ninformation on EDA programs and financial assistance opportunities can \nbe found at <a href=\"http://www.eda.gov\">www.eda.gov</a>.\n    To effectively administer and monitor its economic development \nassistance programs, EDA collects certain information from applicants \nfor, and recipients of, EDA investment assistance. The purpose of this \nnotice is to seek comments from the public and other Federal agencies \non extending the information collection from recipients of awards under \nthe EDA Good Jobs Challenge. This is aligned with ensuring that Federal \nworkforce investments are evidence-based and data-driven, and \naccountable to participants and the public. The original data \ncollection instrument was filed under OMB 0610-0109. This request is to \nextend the expiration of the survey from August 2025 to December 2028 \nand increase the number of respondents who will respond to the data \ncollection. The survey will collect data from recipients, training \nproviders, and participants under the FY 2021 and FY 2024 Good Jobs \nChallenge (GJC) Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFO).\n\nII. Method of Collection\n\n    Data will be collected electronically.\n\nIII. Data\n\n    OMB Control Number: 0610-0109.\n    Form Number(s): None.\n    Type of Review: Regular submission.

Also included was communications equipment; navigation \nequipment; aircraft survivability equipment; initial training equipment \nand services; synthetic training equipment; support package including \nspares and repair parts; special tools and test equipment; aviation \nground support equipment; safety and air worthiness certification; \ntechnical support; maintenance support; technical and aircrew \npublications; mission planning system equipment and support; project \nmanagement and governance; United States (U.S.) Government and \ncontractor engineering and logistics support services; and other \nrelated elements of logistics and program support. The total estimated \nprogram cost was $3.5 billion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) \nconstituted $1.655 billion of this total.\n    This transmittal notifies the addition of the following MDE items:\n\n--Seventeen (17) Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) Systems\n--Seventeen (17) Limited Missile Warning Receiver Systems (LIMWS)\n\n[[Page 22253]]\n\n--Seventeen (17) Degraded Visual Environment Pilotage Systems (DVEPS)\n\n    Also included are Man-Portable Night Vision Devices. The estimated \ntotal value of these new items is $162 million, but their addition will \nnot cause an increase in the total case value. The estimated total case \nvalue will remain at $3.5 billion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) will \nremain at $1.655 billion of this total.\n    (iv) Significance: The proposed sale will enhance the United \nKingdom's capabilities to provide national defense and contribute to \nNATO and coalition operations.\n    (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the foreign \npolicy goals and national security objectives of the U.S. by improving \nthe security of a NATO Ally that is a force for political stability and \neconomic progress in Europe.\n    (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: CIRCM is the next-generation \nlightweight, laser-based, infrared countermeasure system for rotary-\nwing, tiltrotor, and small fixed-wing aircraft across the DoD. CIRCM \nprovides near-spherical coverage of the host platform to defeat \ninfrared (IR)-seeking threat missiles. CIRCM receives an angular \nbearing hand-off from the Missile Warning System (Common Missile \nWarning System (CMWS) or LIMWS) and employs a pointing and tracking \nsystem that acquires and tracks the incoming missile. CIRCM jams the \nmissile by using modulated laser energy, thus degrading the tracking \ncapability of the missile and causing it to miss the aircraft.\n    LIMWS will protect aircraft from missiles by deploying flares and \nby cueing laser-based countermeasure systems such as the CIRCM. The \nLIMWS A-kit is backwards compatible with CMWS. LIMWS maintains \novermatch of quickly emerging threat technology and tactics by \nproviding increased detection range, improved detection in clutter, and \nmore agile algorithms to rapidly respond to emerging Man-Portable Air \nDefense Systems (MANPADS) threats. LIMWS utilizes IR-based sensors to \ndetect incoming missiles and unguided hostile fire, fiber optic cables \nfor high-speed data transmission from the sensors to the system \nprocessor and implements machine learning algorithms.\n    DVEPS provides overmatch by providing increased situational \nawareness to the aircrew in Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) \nconditions such as brownout, allowing Special Operations Aviation \nassets to execute missions in almost any environmental condition. DVEPS \nutilizes using three-dimensional (3D) imaging technology. DVEPS \nproduces imagery, 3D conformal symbology, and system alerts to aid \npilots in maintaining spatial awareness during and after transition \nfrom visual meteorological conditions (VMC) to DVE conditions. DVEPS \nincludes a synthetic vision avionics backbone (SVAB), light detection \nand ranging (LiDAR), removable storage device, infrared camera, power \ndistribution unit, and inertial measurement unit.\n    The highest level of classification of defense articles, \ncomponents, and services included in this potential sale is SECRET.\n    (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: March 12, 2024\n\n[FR Doc. 2025-09363 Filed 5-23-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6001-FR-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Under this absolute priority, the Department will fund \nhigh-quality interdisciplinary projects that prepare personnel in early \nintervention, special education, and related services at the master's \ndegree, educational specialist, or clinical doctorate degree levels for \nprofessional practice in a variety of education settings, including \nnatural environments (the home and community settings in which infants \nand toddlers with and without disabilities participate), early \nchildhood programs, classrooms, schools, and distance learning \nenvironments.\n    Absolute Priority:\n    The purpose of this priority is to increase the number and improve \nthe quality of early intervention, special education, and related \nservices \\1\\ personnel who are fully credentialed to serve children who \nhave high-intensity needs.\\2\\ The priority will fund high-quality \ninterdisciplinary \\3\\ projects that use evidence-based \\4\\ strategies \nto prepare scholars \\5\\ at the master's, educational specialist, or \nclinical doctoral degree levels for professional practice in natural \nenvironments, early childhood programs, classrooms, school settings, \nand in distance learning environments serving children with \ndisabilities who have high-intensity needs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``related services'' \nincludes the following: speech-language pathology and audiology \nservices; assistive technology services; interpreting services; \nintervener services; psychological services; applied behavior \nanalysis; physical therapy and occupational therapy services; \nrecreation, including therapeutic recreation services; social work \nservices; counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling; \nand orientation and mobility services.\n    \\2\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``high-intensity needs'' \nrefers to a complex array of disabilities (e.g., multiple \ndisabilities, significant cognitive disabilities, significant \nphysical disabilities, significant sensory disabilities, significant \nautism, significant emotional disabilities, or significant learning \ndisabilities, including dyslexia) or the needs of children with \nthese disabilities requiring intensive, individualized \nintervention(s) (i.e., that are specifically designed to address \npersistent learning or behavior difficulties, implemented with \ngreater frequency and for an extended duration than is commonly \navailable in a typical classroom or early intervention setting, or \nwhich require personnel to have knowledge and skills in identifying \nand implementing multiple evidence-based interventions).\n    \\3\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``interdisciplinary'' \nrefers to preparing scholars from two or more graduate degree \nprograms in special education or early intervention and one or more \nrelated services through shared coursework, group assignments, and \nextensive and coordinated field or clinical experiences. Different \ngraduate degree programs across more than one institution of higher \neducation may partner to develop an interdisciplinary project.\n    For the purpose of this priority, ``interdisciplinary'' does not \ninclude: (a) individual scholars who receive two or more graduate \ndegrees; (b) one graduate degree program that prepares scholars with \ndifferent areas of focus; (c) one graduate degree program that \noffers interdisciplinary content but does not prepare scholars from \ntwo or more degree programs together; or (d) one graduate degree \nprogram in special education, early intervention, and related \nservices partnering with a graduate degree program other than \nspecial education, early intervention, or related services. Programs \nin which scholars receive only a certificate or endorsement without \na graduate degree are not eligible.\n    \\4\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``evidence-based'' means, \nat a minimum, evidence that demonstrates a rationale (as defined in \n34 CFR 77.1), where a key project component (as defined in 34 CFR \n77.1) included in the project's logic model (as defined in 34 CFR \n77.1) is informed by research or evaluation findings that suggest \nthe project component is likely to improve relevant outcomes (as \ndefined in 34 CFR 77.1).\n    \\5\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``scholar'' means an \nindividual who: (a) is pursuing a bachelor's, certification, \nmaster's, or educational specialist degree in early intervention or \nspecial education; (b) receives scholarship assistance as authorized \nunder section 662 of IDEA (34 CFR 304.3(g)); (c) will be eligible \nfor a license, endorsement, or certification from a State or \nnational credentialing authority following completion of the degree \nprogram identified in the application; and (d) will be able to be \nemployed in a position that serves children with disabilities for a \nminimum of 51 percent of their time or case load. Individuals \npursuing degrees in general education or early childhood education \ndo not qualify as ``scholars'' eligible for scholarship assistance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Specifically, an applicant must propose an interdisciplinary \nproject supporting scholars from two or more graduate degree programs \nin special education or early intervention and one or more related \nservices. An interdisciplinary project is a project that delivers core \ncontent through shared coursework, group assignments, and extensive and \ncoordinated field and clinical experiences as part of two or more \nmaster's degree, educational specialist degree, or clinical doctoral \ndegree programs for scholars. Not all requirements (e.g., courses and \nfield or clinical experiences) of each participating graduate degree \nprogram must be shared across all degree programs participating in the \ninterdisciplinary project, but the interdisciplinary project must: (a) \nidentify the competencies needed to promote high expectations and \naddress the individualized needs of children with disabilities who have \nhigh-intensity needs using an interdisciplinary approach to service \ndelivery; (b) outline how the project will build capacity in those \nareas through shared coursework, group assignments, and extensive and \ncoordinated field or clinical experiences for scholars supported by the \nproposed project; and (c) identify the aspects of each graduate degree \nprogram that are shared across all participating degree programs and \nthose that remain unique to each.\n    Note: Projects may include individuals who are not funded as \nscholars (see footnote 5), but are in degree programs (e.g., general \neducation, early childhood education, administration) that are \ncooperating with the grantee's project. These individuals may \nparticipate in the coursework, assignments, field or clinical \nexperiences, and other opportunities required of scholars' program of \nstudy (e.g., speaker series, monthly seminars) if doing so does not \ndiminish the benefit for project-funded scholars (e.g., by reducing \nfunds available for scholar support or limiting opportunities for \nscholars to participate in project activities).\n    Note: Degree programs across more than one institution of higher \neducation (IHE) may partner together within a project. Personnel \npreparation degree programs that prepare all scholars to be dually \ncertified, including dually certified in special education and a \nrelated service, can qualify under this priority.\n    Personnel preparation programs that prepare individuals to be \neducational interpreters for the deaf at the bachelor's\n\n[[Page 22255]]\n\ndegree level can qualify under this priority and are exempted from (a) \nthe interdisciplinary requirement and (b) the requirement for two or \nmore graduate degree programs. All other priority requirements \nspecified for graduate programs will apply to the bachelor's program. \nWhile interdisciplinary projects are not required for educational \ninterpreters, they are encouraged.\n    Note: Applicants under this priority may not submit the same \nproposal under Personnel Preparation of Special Education, Early \nIntervention, and Related Services Personnel at Historically Black \nColleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled Colleges and \nUniversities, and Other Minority Serving Institutions, ALN 84.325M. \nApplicants may submit substantively different proposals under ALN \n84.325K and ALN 84.325M. The Office of Special Education Programs \n(OSEP) will not fund similar personnel preparation projects within the \nsame IHE across the ALN 84.325K and 84.325M competitions.\n    Note: Eligible applicants may submit only one application under the \n84.325K competition.\n    Focus Areas:\n    Within this absolute priority, the Secretary intends to support \ninterdisciplinary projects under the following two focus areas: (A) \nPreparing Personnel to Serve Infants, Toddlers, and Preschool-Age \nChildren with Disabilities who have High-Intensity Needs; and (B) \nPreparing Personnel to Serve School-Age Children with Disabilities who \nhave High-Intensity Needs.\n    In this competition, Focus Areas (A) and (B) each constitute a \nseparate funding category. The Secretary intends to award grants under \neach of these funding categories, provided that applications submitted \nare of sufficient quality.\n    Applicants must identify the specific focus area (i.e., A or B) \nunder which they are applying as part of the competition title on the \napplication cover sheet (SF 424, line 12).\n    Focus Area A: Preparing Personnel to Serve Infants, Toddlers, and \nPreschool-Age Children with Disabilities who have High-Intensity Needs. \nThis focus area is for interdisciplinary projects that deliver core \ncontent through shared coursework, group assignments, and extensive and \ncoordinated field or clinical experiences for scholars across two or \nmore graduate degree programs in early intervention or early childhood \nspecial education and one or more related services for infants, \ntoddlers, and preschool-age children with disabilities or developmental \ndelays who have high-intensity needs.\n    Early intervention personnel are those who are prepared to provide \nservices to infants and toddlers with disabilities ages birth to three, \nand early childhood personnel are those who are prepared to provide \nservices to children with disabilities ages three through five (and in \nStates where the age range is other than ages three through five, we \ndefer to the State's certification for early childhood special \neducation). In States where certification in early intervention is \ncombined with certification in early childhood special education, \napplicants may propose a combined early intervention and early \nchildhood special education personnel preparation project under this \nfocus area.\n    Focus Area B: Preparing Personnel to Serve School-Age Children with \nDisabilities who have High-Intensity Needs. This focus area is for \ninterdisciplinary projects that deliver core content through shared \ncoursework, group assignments, and extensive and coordinated field or \nclinical experiences to scholars across two or more graduate degree \nprograms in special education and one or more related services for \nschool-age children with disabilities who have high-intensity needs.\n    Focus Areas A and B:\n    Prior to enrolling scholars, applicants may, but are not required \nto, use up to $100,000 of grant funds in the first budget period and up \nto the first 12 months of the performance period for project planning, \nincluding enhancing an existing program. If an applicant chooses to use \nup to the first 12 months for project planning, then the applicant must \nprovide a comprehensive justification for the need for project planning \nand include the goals, objectives, and intended outcomes of the \nplanning; a description of the proposed activities; and a timeline for \nthe work. The plan may include activities such as--\n    (1) Developing new and updating current coursework, assignments, or \nextensive and coordinated field or clinical experiences needed to \nsupport interdisciplinary preparation for personnel in early \nintervention, special education, or related services serving children \nwith disabilities who have high-intensity needs;\n    (2) Building capacity (e.g., hiring a field supervisor, providing \nprofessional development for faculty and field supervisors) of the \npersonnel to prepare scholars to serve children with disabilities with \nhigh-intensity needs and their families;\n    (3) Purchasing needed resources (e.g., additional teaching supplies \nor specialized equipment to enhance instruction); and\n    (4) Establishing relationships with early intervention and early \nchildhood programs or schools to serve as sites for field or clinical \nexperiences needed to support the project. These sites may include \nhigh-need local educational agencies (LEAs),\\6\\ high-poverty \nschools,\\7\\ schools identified for comprehensive support and \nimprovement,\\8\\ and schools implementing a targeted support and \nimprovement plan \\9\\ for children with disabilities; early childhood \nand early intervention programs located within the geographic \nboundaries of a high-need LEA; and early childhood and early \nintervention programs located within the geographical boundaries of an \nLEA serving the highest percentage of schools identified for \ncomprehensive support and improvement or implementing targeted support \nand improvement plans in the State.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``high-need LEA'' means \nan LEA (a) that serves not fewer than 10,000 children from families \nwith incomes below the poverty line; or (b) for which not less than \n20 percent of the children are from families with incomes below the \npoverty line.\n    \\7\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``high-poverty school'' \nmeans a school in which at least 50 percent of students are from \nlow-income families as determined using one of the measures of \npoverty specified in section 1113(a)(5) of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (ESEA). For middle and \nhigh schools, eligibility may be calculated on the basis of \ncomparable data from feeder schools. Eligibility as a high-poverty \nschool under this definition is determined on the basis of the most \ncurrently available data.\n    \\8\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``school implementing a \ncomprehensive support and improvement plan'' means a school \nidentified for comprehensive support and improvement by a State \nunder section 1111(c)(4)(D) of the ESEA that includes (a) not less \nthan the lowest performing 5 percent of all schools in the State \nreceiving funds under title I, part A of the ESEA; (b) all public \nhigh schools in the State failing to graduate one third or more of \ntheir students; and (c) public schools in the State described in \nsection 1111(d)(3)(A)(i)(II) of the ESEA.\n    \\9\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``school implementing a \ntargeted support and improvement plan'' means a school identified \nfor targeted support and improvement by a State that has developed \nand is implementing a school-level targeted support and improvement \nplan to improve student outcomes based on the indicators in the \nstatewide accountability system defined in section 1111(d)(2) of the \nESEA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In addition to requesting up to $100,000 for planning, additional \nFederal funds may also be used for scholar support and other grant \nactivities occurring in year one of the project, provided that the \ntotal request for year one does not exceed the maximum award available \nfor one budget period of 12 months (i.e., $350,000). Applicants \nproposing projects to develop, expand, or add a\n\n[[Page 22256]]\n\nnew area of emphasis to early intervention, special education, or \nrelated services programs must provide, in their applications, \ninformation on how these new areas will be sustained once Federal \nfunding ends.\n    Note: Under 34 CFR 75.250, project periods under this priority may \nbe up to 60 months. Projects should be designed to ensure that all \nproposed scholars successfully complete the program within 60 months \nfrom the project start date. The Secretary may reduce continuation \nawards for any project in which scholar recruitment is not on track or \nscholars are not on track to complete the program within the project \nperiod. The Department intends to closely monitor unobligated balances \nand substantial progress under this program and may reduce or \ndiscontinue funding accordingly consistent with its authority in 34 CFR \n75.253.\n    To be considered for funding under this absolute priority, all \nprogram applicants must meet the requirements contained in this \npriority.\n    To meet the application requirements of this priority an applicant \nmust--\n    (a) Demonstrate, in the narrative section of the application under \n``Significance,'' how--\n    (1) The proposed project will address the need in the proposed \npreparation area to prepare personnel who are fully qualified to serve \nchildren with disabilities who have high-intensity needs;\n    (2) The proposed project will increase the number of personnel in \nthe proposed preparation area who demonstrate the competencies needed \nto--\n    (i) Promote high expectations and improve outcomes, including \nliteracy and math outcomes, for children with disabilities who have \nhigh-intensity needs;\n    (ii) Differentiate curriculum and instruction;\n    (iii) Provide intensive, evidence-based individualized instruction \nand interventions in person and through distance learning technologies \nin a variety of early intervention, early childhood, and school \nsettings (e.g., natural environments; public schools, including charter \nschools; private schools; and other nonpublic education settings, \nincluding home education);\n    (iv) Collaborate with families and other providers using an \ninterdisciplinary team approach to address the individualized \ndevelopmental, learning, and academic needs of children with \ndisabilities who have high-intensity needs, and support their \nsuccessful transitions from early childhood to elementary, elementary \nto secondary, or transition to postsecondary education and the \nworkforce; and\n    (vi) Exercise leadership to improve professional practice and \nservices and education for children with disabilities who have high-\nintensity needs; and\n    (3) The applicant has successfully graduated students in their \nprogram, including data on the number of students who have graduated in \nthe last five years.\n    (b) Demonstrate, in the narrative section of the application under \n``Quality of the project design,'' how--\n    (1) The project will conduct its planning activities, if the \napplicant will use any of the allowable first 12 months of the project \nperiod for planning;\n    (2) The project will recruit and retain scholars.

Review and Selection Process: We remind potential applicants \nthat in reviewing applications in any discretionary grant competition, \nthe Secretary may consider, under 34 CFR 75.217(d)(3), the past \nperformance of the applicant in carrying out a previous award, such as \nthe applicant's use of funds, achievement of project objectives, and \ncompliance with grant conditions. The Secretary may also consider \nwhether the applicant failed to submit a timely performance report or \nsubmitted a report of unacceptable quality.\n    In addition, in making a competitive grant award, the Secretary \nrequires various assurances, including those applicable to Federal \ncivil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or \nactivities receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department \n(34 CFR 100.4, 104.5, 106.4, 108.8, and 110.23).\n    In the event there are two or more applications with the same final \nscore, and there are insufficient funds to fully support each of these \napplications, the scores under selection criterion (b) Quality of the \nproject design will be used as a tiebreaker. If the scores remain tied, \nthen the scores under selection criterion (d) Adequacy of resources \nwill be used to break the tie.\n    3. Additional Review and Selection Process Factors: In the past, \nthe Department has had difficulty finding peer reviewers for certain \ncompetitions because so many individuals who are eligible to serve as \npeer reviewers have conflicts of interest. The standing panel \nrequirements under section 682(b) of IDEA also have placed additional \nconstraints on the availability of reviewers. Therefore, the Department \nhas determined that for some discretionary grant competitions, \napplications may be separated into two or more groups and ranked and \nselected for funding within specific groups. This procedure will make \nit easier for the Department to find peer reviewers by ensuring that \ngreater numbers of individuals who are eligible to serve as reviewers \nfor any particular group of applicants will not have conflicts of \ninterest. It also will increase the quality, independence, and fairness \nof the review process, while permitting panel members to review \napplications under discretionary grant competitions for which they also \nhave submitted applications.\n    4. Risk Assessment and Specific Conditions: Consistent with 2 CFR \n200.206, before awarding grants under this competition, the Department \nconducts a review of the risks posed by applicants. Under 2 CFR \n200.208, the Secretary may impose specific conditions, and under 2 CFR \n3474.10, in appropriate circumstances, high-risk conditions on a grant \nif the applicant or grantee is not financially stable; has a history of \nunsatisfactory performance; has a financial or other management system \nthat does not meet the standards in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D; has not \nfulfilled the conditions of a prior grant; or is otherwise not \nresponsible.\n    5. Integrity and Performance System:\n    If you are selected under this competition to receive an award that \nover the course of the project period may exceed the simplified \nacquisition threshold (currently $250,000), we must make a judgment \nabout your integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under \nFederal awards--that is, the risk posed by you as an applicant--before \nwe make an award. In doing so, we must consider any information about \nyou that is in the System for Award Management's (SAM) Responsibility/\nQualification reports (formerly referred to as the Federal Awardee \nPerformance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)). You may review \nand comment on any information about yourself that a Federal agency \npreviously entered and that is currently in the Responsibility/\nQualification reports in SAM.\n    If the total value of your currently active grants, cooperative \nagreements, and procurement contracts from the Federal Government \nexceeds $10,000,000, the reporting requirements in 2 CFR part 200, \nAppendix XII, require you to report certain integrity information to \nSAM semiannually. Please review these requirements if this\n\n[[Page 22260]]\n\ngrant plus all the other Federal funds you receive exceed $10,000,000.\n    6. In General: In accordance with the Office of Management and \nBudget's guidance located at 2 CFR part 200, all applicable Federal \nlaws, and relevant Executive guidance, the Department will review and \nconsider applications for funding pursuant to this notice inviting \napplications in accordance with--\n    (a) Selecting recipients most likely to be successful in delivering \nresults based on the program objectives through an objective process of \nevaluating Federal award applications (2 CFR 200.205);\n    (b) Prohibiting the purchase of certain telecommunication and video \nsurveillance services or equipment in alignment with section 889 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of 2019 (Pub. L. 115-232) (2 CFR \n200.216);\n    (c) Providing a preference, to the extent permitted by law, to \nmaximize use of goods, products, and materials produced in the United \nStates (2 CFR 200.322); and\n    (d) Terminating agreements in whole or in part to the greatest \nextent authorized by law if an award no longer effectuates the program \ngoals or agency priorities (2 CFR 200.340).\n\nVI.

All.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Note: The Department is not bound by any estimates in this notice.\n    Project Period: Up to 60 months.\n    Background:\n    Based on program data from RSA's administration of the PTI program, \nindividuals with disabilities and their families, particularly those \nfrom underserved populations, commonly experience difficulty acquiring \naccurate information from--and navigating--a complex VR system. The PTI \ncenters can help improve understanding of the varied VR services and \neligibility requirements for programs serving adults and youth with \ndisabilities by coordinating and establishing partnerships with \nprofessionals to provide information to effectively access services. \nPTI centers also provide technical assistance (TA) for transition \nemployment programs so that individuals with disabilities experience a \nsmooth transition from secondary school to employment and other pre-\nemployment and post-school activities.\n    Family engagement is also vital for successful post-school \ntransitions. PTI centers assist families to engage more frequently and \neffectively in support of the education, employment, and independent \nliving goals of individuals with disabilities.\n    In addition to family engagement, community involvement and \ncollaboration has the potential to help enhance the impact of services \nfor individuals with disabilities and their families. For example, \nparents can identify family volunteering opportunities that lead to \nservice learning or work-based learning experiences critical for job \ntraining; this may also support ongoing civic engagement, integration \ninto the community, and contributions as a member of society. PTI \ncenters also create or expand partnerships with community-based \norganizations to enhance supports and services available to individuals \nwith disabilities and their families.\n    Absolute Priorities: For FY 2025, there are two absolute \npriorities, one for regional PTIs (ALN 84.235F) and one for the \nnational PTI (ALN 84.235G). The absolute priorities are from the \nallowable activities in the statute (see section 303(c)(2) of the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 773(c)(2)). We will only consider \napplications that meet one of these priorities.\n    Each application should address only one priority. Applicants may \napply for a regional PTI (ALN 84.235F) and the national PTI (ALN \n84.235G) but must submit two separate applications (one for each ALN). \nFor example, an applicant submitting for region C-1 and the National \nPTI must submit separate applications for each.\n    Priorities:\n    Absolute Priority 1, Regional PTI Centers: Under this priority, we \nprovide grants to establish or continue regional Parent Information and \nTraining Centers (Regional PTI Centers) that provide information and \ntraining to assist individuals with disabilities, and the parents, \nfamily members, guardians, advocates, or other authorized \nrepresentatives of those individuals, to participate more effectively \nwith professionals in meeting the vocational, independent living, and \nrehabilitation needs of individuals with disabilities.\n    Absolute Priority 2, National PTI Center: Under this priority, we \nprovide a grant to establish or continue a National Parent Training and \nInformation center (National PTI Center) that provides TA to the \nRegional PTI Centers and to coordinate the information and training \nprovided by these Regional PTI Centers.\n\nProgram Requirements\n\n    Under section 303(c)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act, a grantee must \nuse the grant funds awarded to assist individuals with disabilities and \ntheir families to achieve the following outcomes:\n    (a) Better understand VR and independent living programs and \nservices.\n    (b) Provide follow-up support for transition and employment \nprograms.\n    (c) Communicate more effectively with transition and rehabilitation \npersonnel and other relevant professionals.\n    (d) Provide support in the development of the individualized plan \nfor employment.\n    (e) Provide support and expertise in obtaining information about \nrehabilitation and independent living programs, services, and resources \nthat are appropriate.\n    (f) Provide support and guidance in helping individuals with \nsignificant disabilities, including students with disabilities, \ntransition to competitive integrated employment.\n    (g) Understand the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act, \nparticularly provisions relating to employment, supported employment, \nand independent living.\n    Note: In responding to the priorities and selection criteria, \napplicants for Regional PTI center grants should address how the \nproposed project will meet these program requirements; and applicants \nfor the National PTI center should address how they will provide TA to \nregional centers to help them meet these program requirements.\n    Selection Criteria: The selection criteria for this competition are \nfrom 34 CFR 75.210 and are as follows:\n    (a) Significance.

Funding Opportunity Description\n\n    Purpose of Program: The purposes of this program are to (1) help \naddress State-identified needs for personnel preparation in special \neducation, early intervention, related services, and regular education \nto work with children, including infants, toddlers, and youth with \ndisabilities; and (2) ensure that those personnel have the necessary \nskills and knowledge, derived from practices that have been determined \nthrough scientifically based research, to be successful in serving \nthose children.\n    Assistance Listing Number (ALN): 84.325M.\n    OMB Control Number: 1820-0028.\n\n[[Page 22266]]\n\n    Priorities: This competition includes one absolute priority and two \ncompetitive preference priorities. In accordance with 34 CFR \n75.105(b)(2)(v), the absolute priority and Competitive Preference \nPriority 1 is from allowable activities specified in the statute (see \nsections 662 and 681 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA) (20 U.S.C. 1462 and 1481)). Competitive Preference Priority 2 is \nfrom 34 CFR 75.225.\n    Absolute Priority: For FY 2025 and any subsequent year in which we \nmake awards from the list of unfunded applications from this \ncompetition, this priority is an absolute priority. Under 34 CFR \n75.105(c)(3), we consider only applications that meet this priority.\n    This priority is:\n    Personnel Preparation of Special Education, Early Intervention, and \nRelated Services Personnel at Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities, Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities, and \nMinority Serving Institutions.\n    Background:\n    It is this Administration's priority that children, including \ninfants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities (children with \ndisabilities) receive instruction and support from educators and \nrelated services personnel who have the necessary qualifications.\n    Therefore, the Department places a high priority on increasing the \nnumber of personnel who provide services to children with disabilities. \nFurther, the Department seeks to fund applications from new potential \ngrantees that prepare special education, early intervention, and \nrelated services leadership personnel. To support these goals, under \nthis absolute priority, the Department will fund projects within \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribally \nControlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs), and Minority Serving \nInstitutions (MSIs) that prepare special education, early intervention, \nand related services personnel at the bachelor's degree, certification, \nmaster's degree, educational specialist degree, or clinical doctoral \ndegree levels to serve in a variety of settings, including natural \nenvironments (the home and community settings in which children with \nand without disabilities participate), early learning programs, child \ncare, classrooms, and schools.\n    Absolute Priority:\n    The purpose of this priority is to prepare and increase the number \nof personnel who have the necessary qualifications to serve children \nwith disabilities. Under this absolute priority, the Department will \nfund grantees from HBCUs,\\1\\ TCCUs,\\2\\ and other MSIs \\3\\ that use \nevidence-based \\4\\ strategies to prepare scholars \\5\\ in special \neducation, early intervention, and related services \\6\\ at the \nbachelor's degree, certification,\\7\\ master's degree, educational \nspecialist degree, or clinical doctoral degree levels to serve in a \nvariety of settings, including natural environments (the home and \ncommunity settings in which children with and without disabilities \nparticipate), early learning programs, child care, classrooms, and \nschools. This priority will fund grantees to prepare personnel to help \naddress identified needs for personnel with the knowledge and skills to \npromote high expectations and provide effective evidence-based \ninterventions and services that improve outcomes for children with \ndisabilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ For purposes of this priority, ``Historically Black Colleges \nand Universities'' means colleges and universities that meet the \ncriteria in 34 CFR 608.2.\n    \\2\\ For purposes of this priority, ``Tribally Controlled \nColleges and Universities'' has the meaning ascribed to it in \nsection 316(b)(3) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended \n(HEA).\n    \\3\\ For purposes of this priority, ``Minority-Serving \nInstitution'' means an institution that is eligible to receive \nassistance under sections 316 through 320 of part A of title III, \nunder part B of title III, or under title V of the HEA. For purposes \nof this priority, the Department will use the FY 2024 Eligibility \nMatrix to determine MSI eligibility (see <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-higher-education/eligibility-designations-higher-education-programs\">www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-higher-education/eligibility-designations-higher-education-programs</a>).\n    \\4\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``evidence-based'' means, \nat a minimum, evidence that demonstrates a rationale (as defined in \n34 CFR 77.1), where a key project component (as defined in 34 CFR \n77.1) included in the project's logic model (as defined in 34 CFR \n77.1) is informed by research or evaluation findings that suggest \nthe project component is likely to improve relevant outcomes (as \ndefined in 34 CFR 77.1).\n    \\5\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``scholar'' is limited to \nan individual who: (a) is pursuing a bachelor's, certification, \nmaster's, educational specialist degree, or clinical doctoral degree \nin special education, early intervention, or related services (as \ndefined in this notice); (b) receives scholarship assistance as \nauthorized under section 662 of IDEA (34 CFR 304.3(g)); (c) will be \neligible for a license, endorsement, or certification from a State \nor national credentialing authority following completion of the \ndegree program identified in the application; and (d) will be able \nto be employed in a position that serves children with disabilities \nfor a minimum of 51 percent of their time or case load. Individuals \npursuing degrees in general education or early childhood education \ndo not qualify as ``scholars'' eligible for scholarship assistance.\n    \\6\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``related services'' \nincludes the following: speech-language pathology and audiology \nservices; assistive technology services; interpreting services; \nintervener services; psychological services; applied behavior \nanalysis; physical therapy and occupational therapy services; \nrecreation, including therapeutic recreation services; social work \nservices; counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling; \nand orientation and mobility services.\n    \\7\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``certification'' refers \nto programs of study for individuals with bachelor's, master's, \neducational specialist, or clinical doctoral degrees that lead to \nlicensure, endorsement, or certification from a State or national \ncredentialing authority following completion of the degree program \nthat qualifies graduates to teach or provide services to children \nwith disabilities. Programs of study that lead to a certificate of \ncompletion awarded from an HBCU, TCCU, or MSI, but do not lead to \nlicensure, endorsement, or certification from a State or national \ncredentialing authority, do not qualify.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Note: Projects may include individuals who are not funded as \nscholars (see footnote 5), but are in degree programs (e.g., general \neducation, early childhood education, administration) that are \ncooperating with the grantee's project. These individuals may \nparticipate in the coursework, assignments, field or clinical \nexperiences, and other opportunities required by the scholars' program \nof study (e.g., speaker series, monthly seminars) if doing so does not \ndiminish the benefit for project-funded scholars (e.g., by reducing \nfunds available for scholar support or limiting opportunities for \nscholars to participate in project activities).\n    Note: Personnel preparation degree programs that prepare all \nscholars to be dually certified can qualify under this priority.\n    Note: Applicants under this priority may not submit the same \nproposal under Interdisciplinary Preparation in Special Education, \nEarly Intervention, and Related Services for Personnel Serving Children \nWith Disabilities Who Have High-Intensity Needs, ALN 84.325K. \nApplicants may submit substantively different proposals under ALN \n84.325M and ALN 84.325K. The Office of Special Education Programs \n(OSEP) will not fund similar personnel preparation projects within the \nsame institution of higher education (IHE) across ALN 84.325K and ALN \n84.325M competitions.\n    Note: Eligible applicants may submit only one application under the \n84.325M competition.\n    Focus Areas:\n    Within this absolute priority, the Secretary intends to support \nprojects under the following two focus areas: (A) Preparing Personnel \nto Serve Infants, Toddlers, and Preschool-Age Children with \nDisabilities; and (B) Preparing Personnel to Serve School-Age Children \nwith Disabilities.\n    In this competition, Focus Areas (A) and (B) each constitute a \nseparate funding category. The Secretary intends to award grants under \neach of these funding categories, provided that applications submitted \nare of sufficient quality.\n    Applicants must identify the specific focus area (i.e., A or B) \nunder which they are applying as part of the competition title on the \napplication cover sheet (SF 424, line 12).\n\n[[Page 22267]]\n\n    Focus Area A: Preparing Personnel to Serve Infants, Toddlers, and \nPreschool-Age Children with Disabilities.\n    This focus area is for projects that prepare early intervention, \nearly childhood special education, and related services personnel to \nprovide services to infants, toddlers, and preschool children with \ndisabilities. Programs preparing early intervention special educators \nand early childhood special educators must prepare graduates to meet \nState and national professional organization standards for early \nintervention special educators and early childhood special educators. \nIn States where certification in early intervention is combined with \ncertification in early childhood special education, applicants may \npropose a combined early intervention and early childhood special \neducation personnel preparation project under this focus area. In \nStates where the certification age range is other than birth through \nfive, applicants must propose a preparation project that complies with \nthe State's certification requirements for early intervention and early \nchildhood special education personnel. Programs that prepare general \nearly childhood educators are not eligible under this competition \nregardless of whether a degree in early childhood education complies \nwith the State's certification requirements for early intervention \nspecial educators or early childhood special educators.\n    Focus Area B: Preparing Personnel to Serve School-Age Children with \nDisabilities.\n    This focus area is for projects that prepare special education and \nrelated services personnel to work with school-age children with \ndisabilities.\n    Focus Areas A and B:\n    Applicants may, but are not required to, use up to the first 12 \nmonths of the project period and up to $100,000 of grant funds awarded \nin the first budget period for planning, including enhancing an \nexisting program, without enrolling scholars. If an applicant chooses \nto use the up to the first 12 months for program planning, then the \napplicant must provide sufficient justification for requesting program \nplanning time and include the goals, objectives, key personnel and \ncollaborators, and intended outcomes of program planning in year one, a \ndescription of the proposed strategies and activities to be supported, \nand a timeline for the work. The proposed strategies may include \nactivities such as--\n    (1) Updating coursework, course outcomes, scholar competencies, \nassignments, or extensive and coordinated field or clinical experiences \nneeded to support preparation for special education, early \nintervention, or related services scholars;\n    (2) Building the capacity (e.g., hiring a field supervisor, \nproviding professional development for faculty and field supervisors) \nof the project to prepare scholars to serve children with disabilities \nand their families;\n    (3) Purchasing needed resources (e.g., additional teaching \nsupplies, technology-based resources, or other specialized equipment to \nenhance instruction); or\n    (4) Establishing relationships, which may include developing \nmemorandums of understandings or other formal agreements, with early \nintervention and early childhood programs or schools, to serve as sites \nfor field or clinical experiences needed to support the project. These \nsites may include high-need local educational agencies (LEAs),\\8\\ high-\npoverty schools,\\9\\ schools identified for comprehensive support and \nimprovement,\\10\\ and schools implementing a targeted support and \nimprovement plan \\11\\ for children with disabilities; early childhood \nand early intervention programs located within the geographic \nboundaries of a high-need LEA; and early childhood and early \nintervention programs located within the geographical boundaries of an \nLEA serving the highest percentage of schools identified for \ncomprehensive support and improvement or implementing targeted support \nand improvement plans in the State.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``high-need LEA'' means \nan LEA (a) that serves not fewer than 10,000 children from families \nwith incomes below the poverty line; or (b) for which not less than \n20 percent of the children are from families with incomes below the \npoverty line.\n    \\9\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``high-poverty school'' \nmeans a school in which at least 50 percent of students are from \nlow-income families as determined using one of the measures of \npoverty specified in section 1113(a)(5) of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (ESEA). For middle and \nhigh schools, eligibility may be calculated on the basis of \ncomparable data from feeder schools. Eligibility as a high-poverty \nschool under this definition is determined on the basis of the most \ncurrently available data.\n    \\10\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``school implementing a \ncomprehensive support and improvement plan'' means a school \nidentified for comprehensive support and improvement by a State \nunder section 1111(c)(4)(D) of the ESEA that includes (a) not less \nthan the lowest performing 5 percent of all schools in the State \nreceiving funds under title I, part A of the ESEA; (b) all public \nhigh schools in the State failing to graduate one third or more of \ntheir students; and (c) public schools in the State described in \nsection 1111(d)(3)(A)(i)(II) of the ESEA.\n    \\11\\ For the purposes of this priority, ``school implementing a \ntargeted support and improvement plan'' means a school identified \nfor targeted support and improvement by a State that has developed \nand is implementing a school-level targeted support and improvement \nplan to improve student outcomes based on the indicators in the \nstatewide accountability system as defined in section 1111(d)(2) of \nthe ESEA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In addition to requesting up to $100,000 for planning, additional \nFederal funds may also be requested for scholar support and other grant \nactivities occurring in year one of the project, provided that the \ntotal request for year one does not exceed the maximum award available \nfor one budget period of 12 months (i.e., $350,000). Applicants \nproposing projects to develop, expand, or add a new area of emphasis \nwithin the curriculum of early intervention, special education, or \nrelated services programs must provide, in their applications, \ninformation on how these new areas will be sustained once Federal \nfunding ends.\n    Note: Under 34 CFR 75.250, project periods under this priority may \nbe up to 60 months. Projects should be designed to ensure that all \nproposed scholars successfully complete the program within 60 months \nfrom the project start date. The Secretary may reduce continuation \nawards for any project in which scholar recruitment is not on track or \nscholars are not on track to complete the program by the end of the 60 \nmonths.\n    To be considered for funding under this absolute priority, \napplicants must meet the application requirements contained in the \npriority. All projects funded under this absolute priority also must \nmeet the programmatic and administrative requirements specified in the \npriority.\n    To meet the application requirements of this priority, an applicant \nmust--\n    (a) Demonstrate, in the narrative section of the application under \n``Significance'' how--\n    (1) The proposed project will address the need in the proposed \npreparation focus area to increase the number of personnel, who are \nprepared to provide effective and evidence-based interventions, and \nservices that improve outcomes, including literacy and math outcomes, \nfor children with disabilities;\n    (2) The proposed project will increase the number of personnel with \ncompetencies in the proposed preparation focus area to provide \neffective evidence-based instruction, interventions, and services, \nincluding through distance education, that improve outcomes, including \nliteracy and math outcomes, for children with disabilities; and\n    (3) The applicant has successfully graduated students from its \nprogram and the number of students who have graduated in the last five \nyears.\n\n[[Page 22268]]\n\n    (b) Demonstrate, in the narrative section of the application under \n``Quality of the project design,'' how--\n    (1) The project will conduct its planning activities if the \napplicant elects to use up to the first 12 months of the project period \nand up to $100,000 awarded in the first budget period for planning;\n    (2) The project will recruit and retain scholars to participate in \nthe project.

Application Review Information\n\n    1. Selection Criteria: The selection criteria for this competition \nare from 34 CFR 75.210 and are as follows:\n    (a) Significance (10 points).\n    The Secretary considers the significance of the proposed project. \nIn determining the significance of the proposed project, the Secretary \nconsiders the importance or magnitude of the results or outcomes likely \nto be attained by the proposed project, especially contributions toward \nimproving teaching practice and student learning and achievement.\n    (b) Quality of the project design (45 points).\n    (1) The Secretary considers the quality of the design of the \nproposed project.\n    (2) In determining the quality of the design of the proposed \nproject, the Secretary considers the following factors:\n    (i) The extent to which the services to be provided by the proposed \nproject reflect up-to-date knowledge and an evidence-based project \ncomponent;\n    (ii) The extent to which the training or professional development \nservices to be provided by the proposed project are of sufficient \nquality, intensity, and duration to build recipient and project \ncapacity in ways that lead to improvements in practice among the \nrecipients of those services; and\n    (iii) The extent to which the proposed project represents an \nexceptional approach to meeting program purposes and requirements and \nserving the target population.\n    (c) Quality of the management plan (20 points).\n    (1) The Secretary considers the quality of the management plan for \nthe proposed project.\n    (2) In determining the quality of the management plan for the \nproposed project, the Secretary considers the following factors:\n    (i) The extent to which the key personnel in the project, when \nhired, have the qualifications required for the\n\n[[Page 22271]]\n\nproposed project, including formal training or work experience in \nfields related to the objectives of the project, and represent or have \nlived experiences of the target population;\n    (ii) The feasibility of the management plan to achieve project \nobjectives and goals on time and within budget, including clearly \ndefined responsibilities, timelines, and milestones for accomplishing \nproject tasks; and\n    (iii) The extent to which the time commitments of the project \ndirector and principal investigator and other key project personnel are \nappropriate and adequate to meet the objectives of the proposed \nproject.\n    (d) Adequacy of resources (10 points).\n    (1) The Secretary considers the adequacy of resources of the \nproposed project.\n    (2) In determining the adequacy of resources of the proposed \nproject, the Secretary considers the following factors:\n    (i) The adequacy of support for the project, including facilities, \nequipment, supplies, and other resources, from the applicant or the \nlead applicant organization; and\n    (ii) The extent to which the budget is adequate to support the \nproposed project and the costs are reasonable in relation to the \nobjectives, design, and potential significance of the proposed project.\n    (e) Quality of the project evaluation or other evidence-building \n(15 points).\n    (1) The Secretary considers the quality of the evaluation or other \nevidence-building to be conducted of the proposed project.\n    (2) In determining the quality of the evaluation or other evidence-\nbuilding, the Secretary considers the following factors:\n    (i) The extent to which the methods of evaluation or other \nevidence-building are thorough, feasible, relevant, and appropriate to \nthe goals, objectives, and outcomes of the proposed project; and\n    (ii) The extent to which the methods of evaluation or other \nevidence-building will provide performance feedback and provide \nformative, diagnostic, or interim data that is a periodic assessment of \nprogress toward achieving intended outcomes.\n    2. Review and Selection Process: We remind potential applicants \nthat in reviewing applications in any discretionary grant competition, \nthe Secretary may consider, under 34 CFR 75.217(d)(3), the past \nperformance of the applicant in carrying out a previous award, such as \nthe applicant's use of funds, achievement of project objectives, and \ncompliance with grant conditions. The Secretary may also consider \nwhether the applicant failed to submit a timely performance report or \nsubmitted a report of unacceptable quality.\n    In addition, in making a competitive grant award, the Secretary \nrequires various assurances, including those applicable to Federal \ncivil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or \nactivities receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department \n(34 CFR 100.4, 104.5, 106.4, 108.8, and 110.23).\n    In the event there are two or more applications with the same final \nscore, and there are insufficient funds to fully support each of these \napplications, the scores under selection criterion (b) Quality of the \nproject design will be used as a tiebreaker. If the scores remain tied, \nthen the scores under selection criterion (d) Adequacy of resources \nwill be used to break the tie.\n    3. Additional Review and Selection Process Factors: In the past, \nthe Department has had difficulty finding peer reviewers for certain \ncompetitions because many individuals who are eligible to serve as peer \nreviewers have conflicts of interest. The standing panel requirements \nunder section 682(b) of IDEA also have placed additional constraints on \nthe availability of reviewers. Therefore, the Department has determined \nthat for some discretionary grant competitions, applications may be \nseparated into two or more groups and ranked and selected for funding \nwithin specific groups. This procedure will make it easier for the \nDepartment to find peer reviewers by ensuring that greater numbers of \nindividuals who are eligible to serve as reviewers for any particular \ngroup of applicants will not have conflicts of interest. It also will \nincrease the quality, independence, and fairness of the review process, \nwhile permitting panel members to review applications under \ndiscretionary grant competitions for which they also have submitted \napplications.\n    4. Risk Assessment and Specific Conditions: Consistent with 2 CFR \n200.206, before awarding grants under this competition the Department \nconducts a review of the risks posed by applicants. Under 2 CFR \n200.208, the Secretary may impose specific conditions, and under 2 CFR \n3474.10, in appropriate circumstances, high-risk conditions on a grant \nif the applicant or grantee is not financially stable; has a history of \nunsatisfactory performance; has a financial or other management system \nthat does not meet the standards in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D; has not \nfulfilled the conditions of a prior grant; or is otherwise not \nresponsible.\n    5. Integrity and Performance System: If you are selected under this \ncompetition to receive an award that over the course of the project \nperiod may exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (currently \n$250,000), we must make a judgment about your integrity, business \nethics, and record of performance under Federal awards--that is, the \nrisk posed by you as an applicant--before we make an award. In doing \nso, we must consider any information about you that is in the System \nfor Award Management's (SAM) Responsibility/Qualification reports \n(formerly referred to as the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity \nInformation System (FAPIIS)). You may review and comment on any \ninformation about yourself that a Federal agency previously entered and \nthat is currently in the Responsibility/Qualification reports in SAM.\n    If the total value of your currently active grants, cooperative \nagreements, and procurement contracts from the Federal Government \nexceeds $10,000,000, the reporting requirements in 2 CFR part 200, \nAppendix XII, require you to report certain integrity information to \nSAM semiannually. Please review these requirements if this grant plus \nall the other Federal funds you receive exceed $10,000,000.\n    6. In General: In accordance with the Guidance for Federal \nFinancial Assistance located at 2 CFR part 200, all applicable Federal \nlaws, and relevant Executive guidance, the Department will review and \nconsider applications for funding pursuant to this notice inviting \napplications in accordance with--\n    (a) Selecting recipients most likely to be successful in delivering \nresults based on the program objectives through an objective process of \nevaluating Federal award applications (2 CFR 200.205);\n    (b) Prohibiting the purchase of certain telecommunication and video \nsurveillance services or equipment in alignment with section 889 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of 2019 (Pub. L. 115-232) (2 CFR \n200.216);\n    (c) Providing a preference, to the extent permitted by law, to \nmaximize use of goods, products, and materials produced in the United \nStates (2 CFR 200.322); and\n    (d) Terminating agreements in whole or in part to the greatest \nextent authorized by law if an award no longer effectuates the program \ngoals or agency priorities (2 CFR 200.340).\n\nVI.

This notice is a \ntechnical update to the effective dates for the Wonderlic Basic Skills \nTest under the heading ATB tests that are no longer approved. The \nDepartment updates the effective dates from July 1, 2015, through March \n31, 2023 to October 25, 1996 through March 31, 2023.\n    In order for a student who does not have a high school diploma or \nits recognized equivalent to be eligible for title IV program \nassistance, the student must successfully complete one of the ATB \nalternatives (listed below) and be enrolled in an eligible career \npathway program (ECPP) \\1\\ pursuant to section 484(d)(1) of the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965, as amended (HEA).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ A student that enrolled in an eligible program at an \neligible title IV institution prior to July 1, 2012 does not have to \nenroll in an ECPP. While this will be a very rare occurrence, please \nsee DCL GEN 12-09 for more guidance. <a href=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/dear-colleague-letters/2012-06-28/gen-12-09-subjecttitle-iv-eligibility-students-without-valid-high-school-diploma\">https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/dear-colleague-letters/2012-06-28/gen-12-09-subjecttitle-iv-eligibility-students-without-valid-high-school-diploma</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The ATB alternatives are--\n    * Passing an independently administered ATB test approved by the \nSecretary;\n    * Completing at least six credit hours, or the equivalent \ncoursework (225 clock hours), that are applicable toward a degree or \ncertificate offered by the postsecondary institution; or\n    * Completing a State process approved by the Secretary.\n    With respect to the ATB test alternative, there are specific \nrequirements for students whose native language is not English, and who \nare not fluent in English. Those students must comply with one of the \nthree following options to qualify for title IV program assistance:\n    1. A student who is enrolled in a program that is taught in the \nstudent's native language must take an approved test developed in the \nstudent's native language pursuant to 34 CFR 668.153(a)(1). Currently \nthere are no approved ATB tests in a language other than English. \nTherefore, these students must use one of the remaining two ATB \nalternatives to qualify for title IV aid;\n    2. A student who is enrolled in a program that is taught in English \nmust take an ATB test designed to measure the English language \ncompetence of a non-native speaker. Students who are enrolled in such a \nprogram that has an ``English as a Second Language'' (ESL) component \nand who are enrolled in the ESL component, must take an approved ATB \ntest specifically for a student whose native language is not English \nand who is not fluent in English, pursuant to 34 CFR 668.153(a)(2). \nSimilarly, students who are enrolled in an ESL only program must take \nan approved ATB test specifically for a student whose native language \nis not English and who is not fluent in English, pursuant to 34 CFR \n668.153(a)(2);\n    3. A student who is enrolled in a program that is taught in English \nwithout an ESL component or does not enroll in the ESL component of the \nprogram, must take an ATB test in English that assesses secondary \nschool verbal and quantitative skills, pursuant to 34 CFR \n668.153(a)(3).\n    List of approved tests and passing scores: The Secretary lists \nbelow all approved ATB tests and their passing scores. As noted above, \nthere are no changes to the June 14, 2024, list of currently approved \nATB Tests (89 FR 50584).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Test publisher\n            ATB test                Passing scores          contact\n                                                          information\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Combined English Language       CELSA Form 1 (97),  Association of\n Skills Assessment (CELSA),        CELSA Form 2 (97).

In accordance with 34 CFR \n75.105(b)(2)(v), the absolute priority and Competitive Preference \nPriority 1 are from allowable activities specified in the statute (see \nsections 662 and 681 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA); 20 U.S.C. 1462 and 1481). Competitive Preference Priority 2 is \nfrom 34 CFR 75.225.\n    Absolute Priority: For FY 2025 and any subsequent year in which we \nmake awards from the list of unfunded applications from this \ncompetition, this priority is an absolute priority. Under 34 CFR \n75.105(c)(3), we consider only applications that meet this priority.\n    This priority is:\n    Preparation of Special Education and Early Intervention \nAdministrators.\n    Background:\n    It is this Administration's priority to prepare and increase the \nnumber of personnel who are well qualified for, and can act effectively \nin, leadership positions in State educational agencies (SEAs), charter \nmanagement organizations, charter school authorizers, lead agencies, \nlocal educational agencies (LEAs), private school networks, parochial \nschools, early intervention services programs, or schools.

Selection Criteria: The selection criteria for this competition \nare from 34 CFR 75.210 and are as follows:\n    (a) Significance (10 points).\n    The Secretary considers the significance of the proposed project. \nIn determining the significance of the proposed project, the Secretary \nconsiders the importance or magnitude of the results or outcomes likely \nto be attained by the proposed project, especially contributions toward \nimproving teaching practice and student learning and achievement.\n    (b) Quality of the project design (35 points).\n    (1) The Secretary considers the quality of the design of the \nproposed project.\n    (2) In determining the quality of the design of the proposed \nproject, the Secretary considers the following factors:\n    (i) The extent to which the services to be provided by the proposed \nproject reflect up-to-date knowledge and an evidence-based project \ncomponent;\n    (ii) The extent to which the training or professional development \nservices to be provided by the proposed project are of sufficient \nquality, intensity, and duration to build recipient and project \ncapacity in ways that lead to improvements in practice among the \nrecipients of those services; and\n    (iii) The extent to which the proposed project represents an \nexceptional approach to meeting program purposes and requirements and \nserving the target population.\n    (c) Quality of the management plan (20 points).\n    (1) The Secretary considers the quality of the management plan for \nthe proposed project.\n    (2) In determining the quality of the management plan for the \nproposed project, the Secretary considers the following factors:\n    (i) The extent to which the key personnel in the project, when \nhired, have the qualifications required for the proposed project, \nincluding formal training or work experience in fields related to the \nobjectives of the project, and represent or have lived experiences of \nthe target population;\n    (ii) The feasibility of the management plan to achieve project \nobjectives and goals on time and within budget, including clearly \ndefined responsibilities, timelines, and milestones for accomplishing \nproject tasks; and\n    (iii) The extent to which the time commitments of the project \ndirector and principal investigator and other key project personnel are \nappropriate and adequate to meet the objectives of the proposed \nproject.\n    (d) Adequacy of resources (20 points).\n    (1) The Secretary considers the adequacy of resources of the \nproposed project.\n    (2) In determining the adequacy of resources of the proposed \nproject, the Secretary considers the following factors:\n    (i) The adequacy of support for the project, including facilities, \nequipment, supplies, and other resources, from the applicant or the \nlead applicant organization; and\n    (ii) The extent to which the budget is adequate to support the \nproposed project and the costs are reasonable in relation to the \nobjectives, design, and potential significance of the proposed project.\n    (e) Quality of the project evaluation or other evidence-building \n(15 points).\n    (1) The Secretary considers the quality of the evaluation or other \nevidence-building to be conducted of the proposed project.\n    (2) In determining the quality of the evaluation or other evidence-\nbuilding, the Secretary considers the following factors:\n    (i) The extent to which the methods of evaluation or other \nevidence-building are thorough, feasible, relevant, and appropriate to \nthe goals, objectives, and outcomes of the proposed project; and\n    (ii) The extent to which the methods of evaluation or other \nevidence-building will provide performance feedback and provide \nformative, diagnostic, or interim data that is a periodic assessment of \nprogress toward achieving intended outcomes.\n    2. Review and Selection Process: We remind potential applicants \nthat in reviewing applications in any discretionary grant competition, \nthe Secretary may consider, under 34 CFR 75.217(d)(3), the past \nperformance of the applicant in carrying out a previous award, such as \nthe applicant's use of funds, achievement of project objectives, and \ncompliance with grant conditions. The Secretary may also consider \nwhether the applicant failed to submit a timely performance report or \nsubmitted a report of unacceptable quality.\n    In addition, in making a competitive grant award, the Secretary \nrequires various assurances, including those applicable to Federal \ncivil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or \nactivities receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department \n(34 CFR 100.4, 104.5, 106.4, 108.8, and 110.23).\n    In the event there are two or more applications with the same final \nscore, and there are insufficient funds to fully support each of these \napplications, the scores under selection criterion (b) Quality of the \nproject design will be used as a tiebreaker. If the scores remain tied, \nthen the scores under selection criterion (d) Adequacy of resources \nwill be used to break the tie.\n    3. Additional Review and Selection Process Factors: In the past, \nthe Department has had difficulty finding peer reviewers for certain \ncompetitions because so many individuals who are eligible to serve as \npeer reviewers have conflicts of interest. The standing panel \nrequirements under section 682(b) of IDEA also have placed additional \nconstraints on the availability of reviewers. Therefore, the Department \nhas determined that for some discretionary grant competitions, \napplications may be separated into two or more groups and ranked and \nselected for funding within specific groups. This procedure will make \nit easier for the Department to find peer reviewers by ensuring that \ngreater numbers of individuals who are eligible to serve as reviewers \nfor any particular group of applicants will not have conflicts of \ninterest. It also will increase the quality, independence, and fairness \nof the review process, while permitting panel members to review \napplications under discretionary grant competitions for which they also \nhave submitted applications.\n    4. Risk Assessment and Specific Conditions: Consistent with 2 CFR \n200.206, before awarding grants under this competition the Department \nconducts a review of the risks posed by applicants. Under 2 CFR \n200.208, the Secretary may impose specific conditions, and under 2 CFR \n3474.10, in appropriate circumstances, high-risk conditions on a grant \nif the applicant or grantee is not financially stable; has a history of \nunsatisfactory performance; has a financial or other management system \nthat does not meet the standards in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D; has not \nfulfilled the conditions of a prior grant; or is otherwise not \nresponsible.\n    5. Integrity and Performance System: If you are selected under this \ncompetition to receive an award that over the course of the project \nperiod may exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (currently \n$250,000), we must make a judgment about your integrity, business \nethics, and record of performance under Federal awards--that is, the \nrisk posed by you as an\n\n[[Page 22280]]\n\napplicant--before we make an award. In doing so, we must consider any \ninformation about you that is in the System for Award Management's \n(SAM) Responsibility/Qualification reports (formerly referred to as the \nFederal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)). \nYou may review and comment on any information about yourself that a \nFederal agency previously entered and that is currently in the \nResponsibility/Qualification reports in SAM.\n    If the total value of your currently active grants, cooperative \nagreements, and procurement contracts from the Federal Government \nexceeds $10,000,000, the reporting requirements in 2 CFR part 200, \nAppendix XII, require you to report certain integrity information to \nSAM semiannually. Please review these requirements if this grant plus \nall the other Federal funds you receive exceed $10,000,000.\n    6. In General: In accordance with the Guidance for Federal \nFinancial Assistance located at 2 CFR part 200, all applicable Federal \nlaws, and relevant Executive guidance, the Department will review and \nconsider applications for funding pursuant to this notice inviting \napplications in accordance with--\n    (a) Selecting recipients most likely to be successful in delivering \nresults based on the program objectives through an objective process of \nevaluating Federal award applications (2 CFR 200.205);\n    (b) Prohibiting the purchase of certain telecommunication and video \nsurveillance services or equipment in alignment with section 889 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of 2019 (Pub.

The average burden hours per response remains \nunchanged at 1 hour, reflecting few substantive changes described \nabove.\n    <bullet> Adult Contact Profile (Form S-7): The Adult Contact \nProfile was developed for the UC Path case management system which was \nnever implemented; the Adult Contact Profile is currently approved \nunder the Services Provided to Unaccompanied Alien Children information \ncollection (OMB # 0970-0553) is being renewed with one substantive \nchange. ORR plans to incorporate the adult contact profile with all UC \nPath features into the UAC Portal case management system at a future \ndate, which will allow ORR to establish unique UAC Portal profiles for \nnon-sponsor adults, such as household members, relatives in home \ncountry, and designated alternate caregivers. This will facilitate \nimproved data tracking and flagging across cases should these \nindividuals later apply to sponsor a child.\n    [cir] Remove the ``Legal Status'' question from the form as \nirrelevant and immaterial to facilitating better data tracking across \ncases.\n    <bullet> Initial Assessment (Form S-8): Currently, there are two \napproved versions of this form-one for UAC Portal, ORR's online case \nmanagement system, and one for the UC Path system, a proposed \nreplacement for the UAC Portal which was never implemented.

The average burden hours per \nresponse remains unchanged at .33 hours reflecting the minimal \nsubstantive changes described above.\n    <bullet> Category 4 Reunification Case Review and Staffing (Form \nTBD-#): This\n\n[[Page 22301]]\n\nis a new form created by ORR to support sponsor identification and \noutreach for children designated ``Category 4'' or without a viable \nsponsor. The form is completed by the care provider case manager, and \nin complex cases, by the care provider clinician in response to the \nchild's Mobility Map, also submitted for approval under this \ninformation collection. The contents of the form, once complete, are \nshared with a concurrent planning team comprised of the care provider \nCase Manager, Supervising Case Manager, Clinician, Case Coordinator, \nand Federal Field Specialist at a staffing meeting to discuss findings \nand develop an action plan to identify a qualified sponsor for the \nchild. The burden estimate for this form is as follows:\n    [cir] ORR estimates, based on historic averages that approximately \n23,400 children or 36 percent of cases referred to ORR care and custody \nin FY 2025 will be designated ``Category 4'' at some point during their \nlength of care. The number of case managers completing the form is \nestimated to be 300 annually, the number of clinicians completing the \nform is estimated to be 300 annually. The average number of responses \nper respondent is estimated to be approximately 98 per case manager and \napproximately 49 per clinician as clinicians will only complete the \nform if the case is deemed ``complex'' due to extended length of stay, \nmedically fragile status of the child, trafficking, abuse, or neglect \nhistory concerns, or other extenuating circumstances that may make \nreunification with a vetted sponsor more difficult. The average burden \nhour per response associated with this form is estimated to be 1.88 \nhours for standard, non-complex cases involving only the child's case \nmanager and 2.5 hours for complex cases requiring the involvement of a \nclinician.\n    <bullet> Family Finding and Mobility Mapping (Form TBD): This form \nis an instructional guide for use by care provider case managers and \nclinicians to facilitate the creation of a ``Mobility Map'' by a \nCategory 4 child. The mobility map is a visual representation of the \nchild's life in their home country and their journey to the U.S., which \nis intended to identify parents, legal guardians, extended family \nmembers, family friends, kinship networks, and other potential sponsor \nleads as well as identify potential sponsor fraud and parental rights \nviolations. The Mobility Map is created by the child in response to \nchild-friendly questions and facilitative techniques deployed by a care \nprovider case manager, and potentially a clinician if the child's case \nis complex. The Family Finding and Mobility Mapping Guide provides \ninstructions to care provider staff to engage the child safely and \neffectively in this Participatory Learning and Action process. The \nburden estimate for the Mobility Map is as follows:\n    [cir] ORR estimates, based on historic averages that approximately \n23,400 children or 36 percent of cases referred to ORR care and custody \nin FY2025 will be designated ``Category 4'' at some point during their \nlength of care. The number of children completing the form is estimated \nto be approximately 35,247, the number of case managers completing the \nform is estimated to be approximately 300, and the number of clinicians \ncompleting the form is estimated to be approximately 300. The average \nnumber of responses per respondent is estimated to be approximately 1.5 \nper child, approximately 117 per case manager and approximately 59 per \nclinician as clinicians will only participate in the Mobility Mapping \nprocess if the case is deemed ``complex'' due to extended length of \nstay, medically fragile status of the child, trafficking, abuse, or \nneglect history concerns, or other extenuating circumstances that may \nmake reunification with a vetted sponsor more difficult.

Identify all emailed requests by the title \nof the information collection.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \n    Description: Section 511(e)(8)(A) of Title V of the Social Security \nAct requires that grantees under the MIECHV program conduct a needs \nassessment. Section 511(d) requires that grantees collect and report on \nquantifiable, measurable 3- and 5-year benchmarks for demonstrating \nthat the program results in improvements for the eligible families \nparticipating in the program across six benchmark areas, and section \n511(d)(3) requires that grantees use the majority of funds to implement \nevidence-based home visiting models. Section 511(h)(2)(A) further \nstates that the requirements for the MIECHV grants to tribes, tribal \norganizations, and urban Indian organizations (i.e., Tribal MIECHV \ngrants) are to be consistent, to the greatest extent practicable, with \nthe requirements for grantees under the MIECHV program for states and \njurisdictions. ACF/ECD, in collaboration with the Health Resources and \nServices Administration Maternal and Child Health Bureau, awarded \ngrants for the Tribal MIECHV Program to support cooperative agreements \nto conduct a (CNRA); plan for and implement high-quality, culturally-\nrelevant, evidence-based home visiting programs in at-risk tribal \ncommunities; establish, measure, and report on progress toward meeting \nperformance measures in the six legislatively-mandated benchmark areas; \nand participate in research and evaluation activities to build the \nknowledge base on home visiting among Native populations.\n    During the first grant year, per the Notice of Funding Opportunity \nfor these awards, Tribal Home Visiting grantees must comply with the \nrequirement to conduct a CNRA and must also submit an implementation \nplan that should outline planned activities to be carried out under the \nprogram in years 2-5 of their cooperative agreements (including the \nevidence-based model to be implemented and the plan for collecting and \nreporting on benchmarks data). To assist grantees with meeting these \nrequirements, ACF created a CNRA and implementation guidance for \ngrantees to use when writing their plans. The CNRA Guidance and \nImplementation Plan Guidance specifies that grant recipients must \nprovide a plan to address the following areas:\n\n<bullet> CNRA\n<bullet> Program Design\n<bullet> Program Blueprint\n<bullet> Plan for Data Collection, Management, and Performance \nMeasurement\n<bullet> Plan for Using Data for Quality Assurance, Fidelity \nMonitoring, and Program Improvement\n\n    Respondents: Tribal Home Visiting Managers (information collection \ndoes not include direct interaction with individuals or families that \nreceive the services).\n\n                                             Annual Burden Estimates\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Total  number\n                                                   Total  number   of  responses      Average      Total  burden\n                   Instrument                           of              per        burden hours        hours\n                                                    respondents     respondent     per response\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTribal MIECHV Implementation Plan Guidance......              27               1             450          12,150\nTribal MIECHV CNRA..............................              27               1             450          12,150\n                                                 ---------------------------------------------------------------\n    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours:........  ..............  ..............  ..............          24,300\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Authority: Title V of the Social Security Act, Sections \n511(e)(8)(A) & 511(h)(2)(A).\n\nMary C.

Identify all emailed requests by the title \nof the information collection.\n\n[[Page 22305]]\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \n    Description: This request is to remove six forms, which will be \ntransferred into a new information collection, and revise five existing \nforms in this collection. ORR also proposes retitling this information \ncollection from ``Administration and Oversight for the Unaccompanied \nChildren Program'' to ``Unaccompanied Alien Children Bureau \nAdministrative Activities'' to better describe the types of forms in \nthe information collection and to reflect with a recent name change for \nthe program.\n\nForms Being Removed and Transferred Into a New Information Collection\n\n    ORR UACB is in the process of reorganizing its information \ncollections to create more unique information collections that will \ncontain fewer forms under each OMB control number. This will promote \noperational efficiency for UACB by decreasing the burden associated \nwith renewing large collections and enabling UACB to create more \npurpose-specific information collections. In addition, this will \nfacilitate OMB review by ensuring the scope of the collection is \ntargeted and narrower than existing collections, resulting in clearer \nrequests.\n    As part of that reorganization effort, ORR plans to move the \nNotification of Concern (Form A-7) into a new information collection \ntitled ``Home Study and Post-Release Services for Unaccompanied Alien \nChildren.''\n    ORR also plans to move the following forms into a new information \ncollection titled ``Incident Reporting for the Unaccompanied Alien \nChildren Bureau.''

The annual number of respondents \nincreased from 4,000 to 9,620 and the average burden hours per response \nincreased from 0.25 to 0.5.\n\n<bullet> Notice to Unaccompanied Alien Children for Class Counsel \nVisits (Forms A-4)\n\n    [cir] Expand the scope of the form so it may be used for visits \nfrom any class counsel, not just Flores counsel.\n    [cir] Change the title of the form from ``Notice to UC for Flores \nCounsel Visits'' to ``Notice to Unaccompanied Alien Children for Class \nCounsel Visits''.\n    [cir] Change ``UC'' and ``unaccompanied child'' to ``UAC'' and \n``unaccompanied alien child'' throughout the form.\n    [cir] Add a field for ``Settlement Agreement'' with dropdown \noptions for active settlement agreements.\n    [cir] Update the language describing what the settlement generally \nrequires of the government so that there is language that corresponds \nwith each option in the ``Settlement Agreement'' dropdown field.\n\n<bullet> Care Provider Facility Tour Request (Form A-1A)\n\n    [cir] Retitle the form from ``Care Provider Facility Tour Request'' \nto ``Care Provider Facility Tour and Visit Request'' to better \nrepresent the purpose of the form.

The annual number of respondents increased \nfrom 200 to 620 and the average burden hours per response increased \nfrom 0.17 to 0.33.\n\n<bullet> Key Personnel Minimum Qualifications Checklist and Attestation \n(Form A-14)\n\n    [cir] Change ``UC'' and ``unaccompanied child'' to ``UAC'' and \n``unaccompanied alien child'' throughout the form.\n    [cir] Revise the introductory text to the form to remove repetition \nand improve readability.\n    [cir] Revise Section D: Candidate Minimum Qualifications to:\n    [ssquf] Reorganize how the minimum qualifications for each position \nare displayed to make it easier for the respondent to understand the \nrequirements.\n    [ssquf] Change the ``Candidate does not meet minimum \nqualification'' checkbox into a question that asks ``Does the candidate \nmeet the minimum qualification?'' with yes/no options so that the \nrespondent may more clearly communicate whether the candidate meets \nminimum qualifications.\n    [ssquf] Update the qualifications for each position and add two new \npositions (Background Check Specialist and Lead Medical Coordinator) to \nreflect revisions that are under consideration for ORR's residential \nservices cooperative agreement.\n    [cir] Revise the burden estimate to account for an increase in the \nnumber of care provider facilities, a decrease in the number of forms \nsubmitted, and more accurately reflect how long it takes to complete \nthe form.

The \nFederal Offset Program is a cooperative effort among the Department of \nthe Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, OCSE, and state child \nsupport agencies (CSAs). The Passport Denial Program reports \nnoncustodial parents who owe child and spousal support above a \nspecified threshold to the U.S. Department of State, which will then \ndeny passports to these individuals. State CSAs routinely submit the \nnames, Social Security numbers, and the amount(s) of past-due child and \nspousal support of noncustodial parents who are delinquent in making \npayments to OCSE. The processing screens underwent minor formatting \nenhancements and OCSE removed the option to select gender.\n    Respondents: Child Support Agencies.\n\n                                             Annual Burden Estimates\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                            Average\n                                                                          Annual number     annual      Annual\n            Information collection instrument                Number of     of responses     burden      burden\n                                                            respondents   per respondent   hours per     hours\n                                                                                           response\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput Record Specifications..............................            54               52          .3       842.4\nOutput Record Specifications.............................            54               52         .46    1,291.68\nPayment File (Charts 4-5)................................            54               52         .14      393.12\nAnnual Certification Letter..............................            54                1          .4        21.6\nChild Support Portal Processing Screens..................           173              281         .01      486.13\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page 22307]]\n\n    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 3,034.93.\n    Authority: 42 U.S.C. 652(b); 42 U.S.C. 664; 26 U.S.C. 6402(c); 31 \nCFR 285.3; 45 CFR 302.60; 45 CFR 303.72; 31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.; 31 \nU.S.C. 3716(h); 31 CFR 285.1; 42 U.S.C. 652(k); 42 U.S.C. 654(31); 22 \nCFR 51.60; 42 U.S.C. 654(31); 42 U.S.C. 664; 31 CFR 285.1; and 31 CFR \n285.3.\n\nMary C.

Identify all emailed requests by the title \nof the information collection.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \n    Description: ORR has undertaken a reorganization of its information \ncollections to promote operational efficiency. The reorganization will \nresult in more collections that contain fewer forms under a single OMB \nnumber. This request is to create a new information collection that \ncontains forms associated with the provision of home study and post-\nrelease services (HS/PRS) to children and their sponsors. This \ninformation collection will contain a total of six revised forms \ntransferred from three existing information collections. The forms and \nthe information collections under which they are currently approved are \nas follows:\n    <bullet> Administration and Oversight of the Unaccompanied Alien \nChildren Program (OMB #0970-0547):\n\n[cir] Notification of Concern (Form A-7)\n\n    <bullet> Services Provided to Unaccompanied Alien Children (OMB \n#0970-0553):\n\n[cir] Home Study Assessment (Form S-6)\n[cir] Post-Release Service Referral (Form S-19)\n[cir] Post-Release Services Report (Form S-22)\n[cir] Home Study Referral (Form S-26)\n\n    <bullet> Release of Unaccompanied Alien Children from ORR Custody \n(OMB #0970-0552):\n\n[cir] Virtual Check-in Questionnaire (Form R-6)\n\n    These forms are completed by care provider case managers at care \nprovider facilities to initiate the referral process for children and \nsponsors to receive HS/PRS and to document the outcome of safety and \nwell-being follow-up calls to sponsors and released children; by PRS \ncaseworkers to document the provision of PRS, to capture high-level \nmilestones in the child's case after reunification; and to notify ORR \nof concerning situations that affect a child's safety and well-being, \npost-release; by home study caseworkers to document and assess the \nconditions present in the sponsor's home that may impact the released \nchild's safety and wellbeing. These forms are documentary in nature and \na critical component of the child's case file.\n    In addition to grouping forms related to HS/PRS together in this \ninformation collection, ORR is proposing the following revisions:\n    <bullet> Global Changes across all currently approved forms:\n    [cir] Replace ``Minor'' with ``Child''; replace ``UC'' or \n``Unaccompanied Child'' with ``UAC'' or ``Unaccompanied Alien Child'' \nwherever they appear in conformance with terminology\n\n[[Page 22312]]\n\noriginating in the Homeland Security Act of 2002.\n    [cir] Replace ``Gender'' with ``Sex''; ``male'' and ``female'' as \nthe only menu options in conformance with Executive Order (E.O.) 14168 \n(Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring \nBiological Truth to the Federal Government).\n    [cir] Remove sponsor categories ``2A'' and ``2B''; Replace with \n``Category 2'' to conform with updates to Unaccompanied Alien Children \npolicy Field Guidance #26--Fingerprint Background Checks and Acceptable \nSupporting Documentation for a Family Reunification Application which \neliminates the past primary caregiver (``2A'') sponsor category \ndistinction.\n    [cir] Change all fields that capture both date and time to only \ncapture the date where time of completion is immaterial.\n    [cir] Add Physical Location of the Child field to the Unaccompanied \nAlien Children Basic Information section which populates across many \nforms in the Unaccompanied Alien Children Portal case management \nsystem.\n    <bullet> Notification of Concern (Form A-7):\n    [cir] Add fields to document gang affiliation including the sub-\nfields:\n    [ssquf] Gang Affiliation: Child--\n    <bullet> Child self-admission;\n    <bullet> Suspected.\n    [ssquf] Gang Affiliation: Sponsor--\n    <bullet> Sponsor self-admission;\n    <bullet> Suspected.\n    [cir] Adjust the burden estimate to account for a decrease in the \nnumber of children placed in ORR care, reflect that the form is \ncompleted by three different groups of respondents, and to reflect an \nincrease in the overall number of fields the respondent will need to \ncomplete. The annual number of respondents increased from 60 HS/PRS \nproviders to include 60 HS/PRS providers, 300 care provider case \nmanagers, and 78 ORR National Call Center (NCC) call specialists. The \nannual number of responses per respondent decreased from 75 responses \nper HS/PRS Caseworker to 41, with the average number of responses per \ncare provider case manager increasing from 0 to 8 and the average \nnumber of responses per ORR NCC call specialist increasing from 0 to \n31. The average burden hours per response increased from 0.25 hours to \n0.33 hours to reflect the addition of new fields described above.\n    <bullet> Home Study Assessment (Form S-6): ORR currently has two \napproved version of this form-one in Word and one that was designed for \nthe Unaccompanied Children Path system, which was never implemented. \nORR proposes discontinuing the Word version and converting the \nUnaccompanied Children Path version into a PDF form with the following \nrevisions:\n    [cir] Add the following fields to the ``Sponsor Identifying \nInformation'' section.\n    [ssquf] Phone Number;\n    [ssquf] Relationship to Child;\n    [ssquf] Marital Status.\n    [cir] Reword existing field labels and add the following fields to \nthe ``Case Information'' section:\n    [ssquf] Date Referred for Home Study;\n    [ssquf] Current Care Provider Facility Name;\n    [ssquf] Care Provider Staff Name;\n    [ssquf] Care Provider Staff Phone;\n    [ssquf] Care Provider Staff email;\n    [ssquf] Supervisor Phone;\n    [ssquf] Supervisor email;\n    [ssquf] Caseworker Phone;\n    [ssquf] Caseworker email;\n    [ssquf] Subcontractor Phone;\n    [ssquf] Subcontractor email.\n    [cir] Under the ``Reason for Referral'' section:\n    [ssquf] Change the ``Referral Type'' field from open text to a \ndropdown with options for ``TVPRA,'' ``Mandated,'' and \n``Discretionary''.\n    [ssquf] Change the ``Reason for Referral'' field from open text to \na list of checkbox options that align with reasons a child's case would \nbe referred for a home study per 45 CFR 410.1204.\n    [ssquf] Add an open text field for ``Additional Information \nSupporting Referral (if Necessary)''.\n    [ssquf] Remove ``Concerns to investigate during visit'' field.\n    [cir] Under the ``Household Members'' section:\n    [ssquf] Change the ``Relationship to Sponsor'' and ``Relationship \nto Child'' from open text to dropdown fields.\n    [ssquf] Add the following fields with ``Yes''/``No'' dropdown:\n    <bullet> Age;\n    <bullet> Present during home study?;\n    <bullet> Child Abuse/Neglect (CA/N) Check?;\n    <bullet> Sex Offender Registry Check?;\n    <bullet> Fingerprinted?\n    [ssquf] Remove the following fields:\n    <bullet> Current Household Member;\n    <bullet> Record ID;\n    <bullet> Related HS Assessment;\n    <bullet> Entry ID.\n    [cir] Remove the following fields from the ``Community Resources'' \nsection:\n    [ssquf] HS Assessment;\n    [ssquf] Entry.\n    [cir] Under the ``Unaccompanied Alien Child Background'' section:\n    [ssquf] Expand a single question concerning a child's \nindividualized needs impacting their daily function into six discreet \nquestions pertaining to physical disabilities, developmental \ndisabilities (including intellectual or cognitive disabilities), \nserious health conditions (including mental health conditions) which \nmay be considered disabilities, current medication regimen, special \ndietary needs, and the routine use of medical equipment. Each new \nquestion includes ``Yes/No'' radio buttons and an open text field for \nfurther elaboration if applicable.\n    [ssquf] Add ``Does the child have an Individualized Section 504 \nPlan?'' with instructions to summarize if yes, concerning the services \nor accommodations that will need to be maintained post-release. This \nquestion was added in response to comments received during the 60-day \npublic comment period.\n    [ssquf] Add a field to document the child's perceived benefits of \nbeing released to the sponsor in response to comments received during \nthe 60-day public comment period.\n    [ssquf] Change the type of response solicited by a question \nconcerning the child's need for support due to criminal, substance use, \nand gang affiliation histories from ``yes/no'' radio buttons to \ncheckboxes for each type of history, and add an open text field for \nfurther elaboration, if needed.\n    [cir] Under the ``Sponsor Background'' section:\n    [ssquf] Add the following questions:\n    <bullet> Does the sponsor have a disability? If yes, describe what \nreasonable accommodations, if any, are required to facilitate the \nchild's safe release to the sponsor. This addition is the result of a \nsuggestion ORR received during the 60-day public comment period.\n    <bullet> How does the sponsor manage the concerns reported above?\n    <bullet> Ask the sponsor to list any local resources they rely on \nor consider to be an asset to the community (ex: libraries, parks, \nclinics, church, community center, nonprofit organizations, social/\naffinity groups, etc.).\n    <bullet> Follow up: Does the sponsor appear knowledgeable about \ntheir community? (Yes/No).\n    [ssquf] Reorganize the three checkboxes confirming that the sponsor \nwas provided certain information into five checkboxes.\n    [cir] Under the Information Provided to the Sponsor sub-section, \nadd ``For a child with an identified disability: The sponsor was \nprovided information regarding the child's disability-related needs and \nspecific post-release services and supports available in the sponsor's \ncommunity. This addition is the result of a suggestion ORR received \nduring the 60-day public comment period.\n    [cir] In the Sponsor's Motivation and Relationship to the Child \nSection, add\n\n[[Page 22313]]\n\ntwo open text boxes that will allow for further elaboration when the \nuser selects ``yes'' for one of the following questions:\n    [ssquf] Does the sponsor have a family support system in the U.S.?\n    [ssquf] Was the sponsor aware or involved in the child's plan to \nmigrate to the U.S.?\n    [cir] Under the Sponsor's Parenting Ability section:\n    [ssquf] Add the following fields:\n    <bullet> Is the sponsor aware of state and local laws on \nsupervision of children?\n    <bullet> If yes, describe the life changes and plans to accommodate \nthe child.

This addition is the \nresult of a suggestion ORR received during the 60-day public comment \nperiod.\n    [cir] Adjust the burden estimate to reflect a decrease in the \nnumber of home studies conducted resulting from an overall decrease in \nthe projected number of referrals, and an increase in the overall \nnumber of fields the respondent will need to complete. The annual \nnumber of respondents is unchanged at 60, the annual number of \nresponses per respondent increased from 81 to 82, and the average \nburden hours per response increased from 0.75 hours to 1.0 hours.\n    <bullet> Post-Release Services Referral (Form S-19):\n    [cir] Move the following fields to appear closer to the top of the \nform:\n    [ssquf] Referral ID;\n    [ssquf] Referral Status;\n    [ssquf] Acceptance Date;\n    [ssquf] Expected Closure Date.\n    [cir] Add the following fields to both the ``PRS-TVPRA'' section \nand ``PRS'' sections under Sponsor Information:\n    [ssquf] Sponsor Phone Number;\n    [ssquf] Sponsor relationship to Child;\n    [ssquf] Sponsor email.\n    [cir] Add the following fields under both the ``PRS-TVPRA'' section \nand ``PRS'' sections under the ``Referring Facility Information'' \nsection:\n    [ssquf] Case Manager Name;\n    [ssquf] Unification Specialist Name;\n    [ssquf] Unification Specialist email.\n    [cir] Add a new section header called ``Referral Information'' and \ngroup the following fields under the new header:\n    [ssquf] What Provider Conducted the Home Study;\n    [ssquf] Reason for Referral;\n    [ssquf] Special Instructions.\n    [cir] Add ``Additional Details'' field with open text next to the \n``Special Instructions'' field.\n    [cir] For the ``Reason for Referral'' field under the PRS-TVPRA \nsection, remove the ``ORR Discretionary'' option and rephrase the \n``Physical or Sexual Abuse by Caregiver (TVPRA)'' field to ``Physical \nor Sexual Abuse (TVPRA)''.\n    [cir] For the ``Reason for Referral'' field under the ``PRS'' \nsection:\n    [ssquf] Rephrase the ``Non-relative Sponsor, Multiple Sponsorship \n(ORR Mandated)'' field to ``Multiple concurrent sponsorships with at \nleast one unrelated child (ORR Mandated)''.\n    [ssquf] Add an option for ``Previously sponsored two or more \nchildren (ORR Mandated)''.\n    [ssquf] Rephrase the ``UC Going to Non-Relative Sponsor (ORR \nMandated No Home Study)'' field to ``Child Going to Non-Relative \nSponsor (No Home Study)''.\n    [cir] Adjust the burden estimate to account for an increase in the \nnumber of care provider facilities completing the form since it's last \nrenewal and a projected decrease in the number of children placed in \nORR care, as well as the expansion of Post-Release Services, which are \nnow offered to every child. These changes also reflect a slight \nincrease in the overall number of fields the respondent will need to \ncomplete. The annual number of respondents increased from 216 to 300, \nthe annual number of responses per respondent increased from 46 to 217 \nand the average burden hours per response increased from 0.33 hours to \n0.5 hours.\n    <bullet> Post-Release Services Report (S-22): ORR plans to digitize \nand incorporate this form into its new interactive, web-based \napplication for PRS.

Additionally, the revised burden estimate reflects a slight \nincrease in the overall number of fields the respondent will need to \ncomplete. The annual number of respondents remains unchanged at 60, and \nthe annual number of responses per respondent increased from 968 to \n2,722. The average burden hours per response increased from 1.0 to 1.08 \nhours.\n    <bullet> Home Study Referral (S-26):\n    [cir] Add radio buttons at the top of the form with the following \noptions:\n    [ssquf] TVPRA;\n    [ssquf] ORR-Mandated;\n    [ssquf] Discretionary.\n    [cir] Move the following fields to appear closer to the top of the \nform:\n    [ssquf] Referral ID;\n    [ssquf] Referral Status;\n    [ssquf] Acceptance Date;\n    [ssquf] Expected Closure Date;\n\n[[Page 22314]]\n\n    [cir] Add the following fields to both the PRS-TVPRA section and \nPRS sections under Sponsor Information:\n    [ssquf] Sponsor Phone Number;\n    [ssquf] Sponsor relationship to Child;\n    [ssquf] Sponsor email.\n    [cir] Add the following fields under both the PRS-TVPRA section and \nPRS sections under the Referring Facility Information section:\n    [ssquf] Case Manager Name;\n    [ssquf] Unification Specialist Name;\n    [ssquf] Unification Specialist email.\n    [cir] Add a new section header called ``Referral Information'' and \ngroup the following fields under the new header:\n    [ssquf] What Provider Conducted the Home Study;\n    [ssquf] Reason for Referral;\n    [ssquf] Special Instructions.\n    [cir] Add ``Additional Details'' field with open text next to the \n``Special Instructions'' field.\n    [cir] For the ``Reason for Referral'' field:\n    [ssquf] Rephrase the ``Non-relative Sponsor, Multiple Sponsorship \n(ORR Mandated)'' field to ``Multiple concurrent sponsorships with at \nleast one unrelated child (ORR Mandated)''.\n    [ssquf] Add an option for ``Previously sponsored two or more \nchildren (ORR Mandated)''.\n    [ssquf] Rephrase the ``UC Going to Non-Relative Sponsor (ORR \nMandated No Home Study)'' field to ``Child Going to Non-Relative \nSponsor (No Home Study)''.\n    [cir] Adjust the burden estimate to account for an increase in the \nnumber of care provider facilities completing the form and a projected \ndecrease in the number of children placed in ORR care. These changes \nalso reflect a slight increase in the overall number of fields the \nrespondent will need to complete. The annual number of respondents \nincreased from 216 to 300, the annual number of responses per \nrespondent increased from 46 to 217 and the average burden hours per \nresponse increased from 0.33 hours to 0.5 hours.\n    <bullet> Virtual Check-In Questionnaire (Form R-6): ORR currently \nhas two approved versions of this form--one in Excel and one that was \ndesigned for a web-based application. ORR proposes discontinuing the \nExcel version and plans to incorporate the other version into its new \ninteractive, web-based application for PRS with some minor \nmodifications as follows:\n    [cir] Change manual entry fields to auto-populate wherever \npossible.\n    [cir] Reword field labels for clarity where needed.\n    [cir] Add instructional text to help the user navigate the form.\n    [cir] Adjust the burden estimate to account for an increase in the \nnumber of PRS providers completing the form and to better estimate the \nnumber of children and sponsors responding to the questionnaire. The \nannual number of respondents decreased from 128,487 to 65,000 for both \nchildren and sponsors and increased from 40 to 60 for PRS providers. \nThe annual number of responses per respondent decreased from 19,273 to \n3,250 for PRS providers, and remains unchanged at 3 each for sponsors \nand children completing all three of the scheduled check-ins.\n    Respondents: ORR grantee and contractor staff, released children, \nand their sponsors.\n    Annual Burden Estimates:\n\n                                     Annual Burden Estimate for Respondents\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     Number of    Average burden\n                      Form                         Annual number   responses per     hours per     Annual total\n                                                  of respondents    respondent       response      burden hours\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotification of Concern (Form A-7)--HSPRS                     60              41            0.33          811.80\n Caseworker.....................................\nNotification of Concern (Form A-7)--Care                     300               8            0.33          792.00\n Provider Case Manager..........................\nNotification of Concern (Form A-7)--ORR NCC                   78              31            0.33          797.94\n Staff..........................................\nHome Study Assessment (Form S-6)................              60              82            1.00        4,920.00\nPost-Release Services Referral (Form S-19)......             300             217            0.50       32,550.00\nPost-Release Services Report (Form S-22)........              60           2,722            1.08      176,385.60\nHome Study Referral (Form S-26).................             300             217            0.50       32,550.00\nVirtual Check-in Questionnaire (Form R-6)--               65,000             3.0            0.25       48,750.00\n Sponsor........................................\nVirtual Check-in Questionnaire (Form R-6)--Child          65,000             3.0            0.25       48,750.00\nVirtual Check-in Questionnaire (Form R-6)--                   60           3,250            0.58      113,100.00\n Provider.......................................\n                                                 ---------------------------------------------------------------\n    Estimated Annual Burden Hours Total.........  ..............  ..............  ..............      459,407.34\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Authority: 6 U.S.C. 279; 8 U.S.C. 1232.\n\nMary C.

This proposed change \nis being made to be consistent with the methodology used by the Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) consistent with CHGME Payment \nProgram's long-standing practice of using the same methodology in \ncalculating FTE counts as CMS does in Medicare GME and to minimize \nadministrative burden on hospital who participate in both programs. \nThis notice summarizes and responds to the comments received during the \n30-day comment period.\n\nDATES: The proposed update to the CHGME direct GME methodology will be \nimplemented beginning in the fiscal year (FY) 2026 application cycle.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robyn Duarte, Public Health Analyst, \nBureau of Health Workforce, Division of Medicine and Dentistry, HRSA, \n5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c49680b1a5b6b0a1f584acb6b7a5eaa3abb2\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"b6e4f2c3d7c4c2d387f6dec4c5d798d1d9c0\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 30, 2024, through a Federal \nRegister Notice, HRSA announced a 30-day public comment period to \nsolicit input on the proposed updated direct GME methodology. Starting \nin FY 2026, where both a CHGME participating hospital's unweighted and \nweighted allopathic and osteopathic FTE resident counts exceed the FTE \nresident cap, the respective weighted allopathic and osteopathic FTE \nresident count is adjusted to equal the FTE resident cap. Where the \nweighted allopathic and osteopathic FTE resident count does not exceed \nthe FTE resident cap, then the adjusted weighted allopathic and \nosteopathic FTE resident count is the actual weighted allopathic and \nosteopathic FTE resident count.\n    This proposed update to the methodology is intended to reconcile \nweighted FTE resident counts reported in Lines 4.13 (both Hospital Data \ncolumns), 5.13, and 6.13 of the HRSA Form 99-1 with Lines 9 and 22 of \nthe CMS Form 2552-10, Worksheet E-4, respectively. Entries in Lines \n4.13 (both Hospital Data columns), 5.13, and 6.13 report the weighted \nresident FTE count for allopathic and osteopathic programs following \napplication of the direct GME FTE resident cap.\n    This updated methodology may result in adjustments to the weighted \nFTE resident 3-year rolling average used to determine direct medical \neducation payment amounts for the eligible children's hospitals \nparticipating in the CHGME Payment Program.\n    HRSA received seven comments in response to the Federal Register \nnotice. HRSA carefully reviewed and considered the comments it received \nand has synthesized and summarized the comments below.\n\nAlignment of CHGME and CMS Direct GME Policy\n\nSummary of Comments\n\n    Commenters supported the adoption of CMS' finalized new methodology \nfor applying the direct GME FTE resident cap when a hospital's weighted \nallopathic and osteopathic FTE resident count is greater than its \ndirect GME FTE resident cap because the proposed updated CHGME \nmethodology provides an opportunity for CHGME participating children's \nhospitals to determine an increased number of weighted allopathic and \nosteopathic FTE residents and mirrors CMS' newly finalized methodology.\n\nResponse\n\n    HRSA agrees the adoption of CMS' modified direct GME payment \nmethodology with respect to determining the number of weighted \nallopathic and osteopathic FTE residents (i.e., fellows) for all \neligible children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment \nProgram beginning in\n\n[[Page 22316]]\n\nFY 2026 will ensure that a participating children's hospital that \ntrains more fellows than included in its direct GME FTE resident cap \ndoes not have its GME FTE resident cap reduced and minimize burden for \nchildren's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment Program that \nmust also comply with CMS regulations.\n\nImpact of Updated CHGME Direct GME Policy\n\nSummary of Comments\n\n    Commenters acknowledged CHGME's adoption of the new methodology \nwill result in changes to weighted allopathic and osteopathic FTE \nresident counts and subsequent CHGME payments. Commenters stated that \ndue to the CHGME payment structure, the updated methodology will affect \neach CHGME participating children's hospital's payments differently, \nand an increase for one hospital may result in changes to other \nhospitals' payments, and therefore the actual impact on individual \nchildren's hospital's payments is unclear.\n\nResponse\n\n    HRSA cannot estimate payments until all the participating \nchildren's hospitals submit their application data and a final \nappropriation is provided, but acknowledges final payment amounts may \nbe affected. The direct medical education and indirect medical \neducation payments allocated to eligible children's hospitals are a \nfunction of the number of resident FTEs participating in approved \nmedical residency programs (including the 3-year rolling average of \nweighted resident FTE counts), inpatient discharges, case mix index, \nand the number of inpatient available beds, as reported by children's \nhospitals in their applications for CHGME Payment Program funding, as \nwell as the total funding appropriated for the program. Each of the \npayments is determined by a legislative payment formula, and a hospital \nreceives its proportion of the total CHGME funding based on the \ncalculation of the formula.\n    The new method of calculating weighted allopathic and osteopathic \nFTE resident counts may result in adjustments to the weighted FTE \nresident 3-year rolling average used to calculate CHGME direct medical \neducation payments for the 59 children's hospitals currently \nparticipating in the program. These adjustments are due to an increase \nin the number of FTE residents credited to those hospitals that had \npreviously reported weighted allopathic and osteopathic FTE residents \nat less than a 0.50 weighting factor due to the prior direct GME method \nof calculating weighted allopathic and osteopathic FTE residents. As \nthe payment amount calculated for each hospital is determined by \nmultiple variables including FTE counts, and each hospital receives a \nshare of the total funding available, it is not possible to determine \nthe effect the updated methodology will have on the payment received by \neach children's hospital.\n\nConclusion\n\n    HRSA thanks the public for their comments. After consideration of \nthe public comments received, HRSA is implementing the modification to \nits direct GME methodology to adopt the CMS methodology described in \nthe amended 42 CFR 413.79 in whole. HRSA anticipates implementing the \nupdated methodology for determining the weighted allopathic and \nosteopathic FTE residents starting in the FY 2026 application cycle \n(project period October 1, 2025, through September 30, 2026).\n    Starting in FY 2026, where both a CHGME participating hospital's \nunweighted and weighted allopathic and osteopathic FTE resident counts \nexceeds the FTE resident cap, the respective weighted allopathic and \nosteopathic FTE resident count is adjusted to equal the FTE resident \ncap. Where the weighted allopathic and osteopathic FTE resident count \ndoes not exceed the FTE resident cap, then the adjusted weighted \nallopathic and osteopathic FTE resident count is the actual weighted \nallopathic and osteopathic FTE resident count.\n    HRSA will ensure information about the updated methodology is \navailable to the public and provide additional information regarding \nany future change in direct GME methodology on the CHGME Payment \nProgram website at <a href=\"https://bhw.hrsa.gov/funding/apply-grant/childrens-hospitals-graduate-medical-education\">https://bhw.hrsa.gov/funding/apply-grant/childrens-hospitals-graduate-medical-education</a>. In addition, if any changes to \ndirect GME methodology are made, HRSA plans to address this methodology \nin a future technical assistance webinar should timing allow. HRSA has \nhistorically sought consistency with CMS regulations to minimize the \nburden for children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment \nProgram, which must also comply with CMS regulations. Consistency \nreduces the potential challenges for CHGME participating hospitals \nreporting FTE resident counts to Medicare and CHGME.\n\nThomas J.

This \nhelps us\n\n[[Page 22319]]\n\nassess the impact of our information collection requirements and \nminimize the public's reporting burden. It also helps the public \nunderstand our information collection requirements and provide the \nrequested data in the desired format.\n    We are especially interested in public comment addressing the \nfollowing:\n    (1) Whether or not the collection of information is necessary for \nthe proper performance of the functions of the agency, including \nwhether or not the information will have practical utility;\n    (2) The accuracy of our estimate of the burden for this collection \nof information, including the validity of the methodology and \nassumptions used;\n    (3) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the \ninformation to be collected; and\n    (4) How might the agency minimize the burden of the collection of \ninformation on those who are to respond, including through the use of \nappropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological \ncollection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., \npermitting electronic submission of response.\n    Comments that you submit in response to this notice are a matter of \npublic record. We will include or summarize each comment in our request \nto OMB to approve this information collection request. Before including \nyour address, phone number, email address, or other personal \nidentifying information in your comment, you should be aware that your \nentire comment--including your personal identifying information--may be \nmade publicly available at any time. While you can ask us in your \ncomment to withhold your personal identifying information from public \nreview, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.\n    Abstract: In 1999, the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee \nrequested that the Department of the Interior (we, DOI), the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture--Forest Service (USDA-FS), and the \nSmithsonian Institution prepare a report on fossil resource management \non Federal lands (Sen. Rep. 105-227, at 60 (1998)). The request \ndirected these entities to analyze the:\n    <bullet> Need for a unified Federal policy for the collection, \nstorage, and preservation of fossils.\n    <bullet> Need for standards that would maximize the availability of \nfossils for scientific study.\n    <bullet> Effectiveness of current methods for storing and \npreserving fossils collected from Federal lands.\n    During the course of preparing the report, the agencies held a \npublic meeting to gather public input. The DOI report to Congress, \n``Assessment of Fossil Management of Federal and Indian Lands,'' was \npublished in May 2000. After the report was released, the \nPaleontological Resources Preservation Act (PRPA) was introduced in the \n107th Congress. PRPA was modeled after the Archaeological Resources \nProtection Act (ARPA) and emphasized the recommendations and guiding \nprinciples in the May 2000 report.\n    The legislation was reintroduced in subsequent Congresses through \nthe 111th Congress when it was included as a subtitle in the Omnibus \nPublic Land Management Act, which became law on March 30, 2009. \nLegislative history demonstrates that PRPA (16 U.S.C. 470aaa-aaa-11) \nwas enacted to preserve paleontological resources for current and \nfuture generations because these resources are nonrenewable and are an \nirreplaceable part of America's heritage. PRPA requires that \nimplementation be coordinated between the Secretaries of the Interior \nand Agriculture and that DOI and USDA-FS issue regulations as \nappropriate to carry out the law.\n    Accordingly, DOI and USDA-FS formed an interagency coordination \nteam in April 2009 to draft the proposed regulations. Members of the \nteam included program leads for paleontology, archaeology, and \nregulatory specialists from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the \nNational Park Service (NPS), the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) (the bureaus), and the USDA-FS.\n    Information collected under this control number includes the \nfollowing:\n    (1) DI Form 9002, ``Paleontology Permit Application'' (43 CFR \n49.115)--Permit applicants proposing to work in areas administered by \nthe BLM, BOR, or USFWS must provide the following information via DI \nform 9002:\n    a. Applicant's name, affiliation, and contact information.\n    b. Description of the applicant's qualifications, to include a \ncurrent resume for the applicant and all other persons who will oversee \nfieldwork and other work, and information on the applicant's past \nperformance on previous permits.\n    c. Maps and other location information, and estimated start and end \ndates of proposed work.\n    d. Description, purpose and methodology of proposed work, including \na detailed scope of work or research plan for the proposed activity, \nlogistical information, methods that will be employed to explore for or \nremove the paleontological resources, proposed content and nature of \nany collection to be made under the permit.\n    e. Information about the proposed repository.\n    f. Description of anticipated costs, including bonding information.\n    (2) DI Form 9003, ``Paleontology Permit'' (43 CFR 49.125(a)).\n    (3) DI Form 9004, ``Paleontology Locality Record'' (43 CFR \n49.125(a)(1) & (6))--Permittee will record locality information on DI \nform 9004 or in another format approved by the bureau in the permit \nthat captures the same information.\n    (4) DI Form 9006, Reports (43 CFR 49.125(a)(14))--Permittees \nconducting activities on lands administered by the BLM, BOR, or USFWS \nmust submit reports to the bureaus using DI form 9006 as a cover sheet. \nUnder some permits, one report may be required summarizing all \nactivities; while other permits may require multiple reports for \nseparate activities under the permit. We use the reports to track and \nmanage the resources and contribute to scientific research.\n    (5) DI Form 9007, Repository Receipt (43 CFR 49.125(a)(10) & \n(11))--Permittee must deposit the collection in the approved repository \nnamed in the permit by the date specified in the permit and provide the \nbureau with DI form 9007, which includes a certification by the \npermittee that the collection and other associated records were \ntransferred to the repository and a certification by the approved \nrepository's authorized official that the collection was received.\n    (6) Resource damage or theft (43 CFR 49.75(a)(8))--Permittee must \nreport suspected or apparent resource damage or theft of \npaleontological or other resources to the Federal land manager as soon \nas possible, but not to exceed 48 hours, after learning of the \nsuspected or apparent damage or theft.\n    (7) List and description of paleontological resources (43 CFR \n49.125(a)(12))--If the permittee has not transferred the collection to \nthe approved repository named in the permit by the date specified in \nthe permit, the permittee must provide the Federal land manager a \ncomplete list and description of all paleontological resources \ncollected and the current location of the paleontological resources.\n    (8) Amendments to permits (43 CFR 49.130(a))--Permittees may \nrequest a modification to a permit. Modification requests will include \npermittee name, permit number, and the reason(s) for the modification \nrequest.\n    (9) Objecting to a notice of violation (43 CFR 49.515(a) & (b))--\nWhen a\n\n[[Page 22320]]\n\nperson receives a notice of violation, the person has 30 days from the \ndate the notice was received to object by submitting to the Federal \nland manager documentation to support the position that the person did \nnot commit a violation or that the proposed penalty should be reduced \nor eliminated.\n    (10) Responding to a civil penalty (43 CFR 49.535(a) & (b))--A \nperson may request a hearing on the Federal land manager's final \nassessment of a civil penalty by filing a request for hearing via \nregistered or certified mail (return receipt requested or other \ndelivery method, delivery receipt requested) to the Departmental Cases \nHearings Division, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of the \nInterior, at the address specified in the final assessment of civil \npenalty. A copy of the request must be served on the Solicitor of the \nDepartment of the Interior at the address specified in the final \nassessment of civil penalty. The request for hearing must include the \nfollowing information:\n    a. The reasons for challenging the final assessment;\n    b. The relief sought and the basis for the relief;\n    c. A copy of the original notice of civil violation and proposed \ncivil penalty assessment;\n    d. A copy of any objection and supporting documentation filed under \n43 CFR 49.515(a) & (b);\n    e. A copy of the final assessment of civil penalty; and\n    f. A certificate of service acknowledging service of the request \nfor hearing with the accompanying documentation on the Office of the \nSolicitor.\n\nProposed Revisions\n\n    With this submission, we propose to revise the following currently \napproved information collections:\n    (1) DI Form 9002, ``Paleontology Permit Application'' (43 CFR \n49.115)--New fields proposed:\n    a. Provide State or administrative area (i.e., forest or NPS unit) \nwhere proposed work will occur. This will allow DOI offices to assign \nlocal contacts to assist applicants and to track work for \nadministrative accountability.\n    b. Is the proposed work identified as hazardous? (Yes/No). For \nexample, work in caves, with helicopters, or using high angle rigging \nor ropes. This will allow bureau offices to learn if an applicant's \nproposed work might be identified as hazardous to either the applicant \nor the public.\n    c. RAPTOR account creation. This field will provide electronic \naccess to the BLM Recreation and Permit Tracking & Online Reporting \n(RAPTOR) system. The information will be collected during RAPTOR \naccount creation and then used to autofill all forms. This additional \nburden hours expended while setting up a RAPTOR account will be offset \nby the autofill feature of the system. Applicants who are unable to use \nthe RAPTOR system will continue to use the original DI 9002 format.\n    (2) DI Form 9004, ``Paleontology Locality Record'' (43 CFR \n49.125(a)(1) & (6))--The original DI 9004 form will remain unchanged, \nbut BLM proposes an additional format that allows permittees to report \nmultiple localities in a single spreadsheet. Applicants requested the \ncapability for a single spreadsheet upload which has proven to expedite \ndata submission for permittees while also reducing administrative \nburden to the bureau.\n    (3) DI Form 9007, Repository Receipt (43 CFR 49.125(a)(10) & \n(11))--We are not proposing changes to the currently approved fields on \nthe DI 9007; however, we plan to update the instructions to state that \npermittees may substitute this form with a copy of the approved \nrepository's museum accession record. This record, provided by the \nrepository, follows a museum best practice and industry standard and so \nmay be submitted in place of DI 9007 in order to reduce duplication of \neffort.\n    Title of Collection: Application and Reports for Paleontological \nPermits, 43 CFR part 49.\n    OMB Control Number: 1093-0008.\n    Form Number: Forms DI-9002, DI-9003, DI-9004, DI-9005, DI-9006, and \nDI-9007.\n    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.\n    Respondents/Affected Public: Individuals; organizations; businesses \n(museums and universities); State, Tribal, or local governments that \ncollect paleontological resources or disturb paleontological sites on \nDOI lands.\n    Total Estimated Number of Annual Respondents: 1,845.\n    Estimated Completion Time per Response: Varies from 1 to 10 hours.\n    Total Estimated Number of Annual Burden Hours: 5,060 hours.\n    Respondent's Obligation: Required to obtain or retain a benefit.\n    Frequency of Collection: On occasion.\n    Total Estimated Annual Nonhour Burden Cost: $288,876 (associated \nwith curation agreements).\n    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required \nto respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a \ncurrently valid OMB control number.\n    The authority for this action is the Paperwork Reduction Act of \n1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).\n\nJeffrey Parrillo,\nDepartmental Information Collection Clearance Officer.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09444 Filed 5-23-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4334-CC-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

The reference prices for facilities producing \nelectricity from closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal \nenergy, solar energy, municipal solid waste, qualified hydropower \nproduction, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy have not been \ndetermined for calendar year 2025.\n    Phaseout Calculation: Because the 2025 reference price for \nelectricity produced from wind (3.1 cents per kilowatt hour) does not \nexceed 8 cents multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor (1.9971), \nthe phaseout of the credit provided in section 45(b)(1) does not apply \nto such electricity sold during calendar year 2025. For electricity \nproduced from closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal \nenergy, solar energy, municipal solid waste, qualified hydropower \nproduction, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy, the phaseout \nof the credit provided in section 45(b)(1) does not apply to such \nelectricity sold during calendar year 2025.\n    Inflation Reduction Act Amendments: Section 45 was amended by \nsection 13101 of Public Law 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818 (August 16, 2022), \ncommonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA \nchanged the manner in which the section 45 credit amounts are \ncalculated for any qualified facility placed in service after December \n31, 2021.\n    As amended by the IRA, section 45(b)(6)(A) provides that, in the \ncase of any qualified facility that satisfies the requirements of \nsection 45(b)(6)(B), the credit amount determined under section 45(a) \n(determined after the application of section 45(b)(1) through (5) and \nwithout regard to section 45(b)(6)) is equal to such amount multiplied \nby 5. A qualified facility satisfies the requirements of section \n45(b)(6)(B) if it is placed in service after December 31, 2021, and it \nis one of the following: (i) a facility with a maximum net output of \nless than 1 megawatt (as measured in alternating current); (ii) a \nfacility the construction of which began prior to January 29, 2023, \nwhich is the date that is 60 days after the publication of the guidance \nwith respect to the requirements of section 45(b)(7)(A) (prevailing \nwage requirements) and section 45(b)(8) (apprenticeship requirements); \nor (iii) a facility that satisfies the requirements of section \n45(b)(7)(A) and (8).\\1\\ The IRA also added bonus credit amounts with \nrespect to qualified facilities placed in service after December 31, \n2022, that meet domestic content requirements under section 45(b)(9) \n\\2\\ or energy community requirements under section 45(b)(11).\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See sections 1.45-6, 1.45-7, 1.45-8, and 1.45-12 of the \nIncome Tax Regulations for additional information regarding the \nrequirements of section 45(b)(6)(B).\n    \\2\\ See Notice 2023-38, 2023-22 I.R.B. 872 (May 12, 2023), \nNotice 2024-41, 2024-24 I.R.B. 1615 (May 16, 2024), corrected at IR \n2024-147 (May 24, 2024), and Notice 2025-08, 2025-8 I.R.B. 800 \n(February 18, 2025), for additional information regarding the \ndomestic content bonus credit.\n    \\3\\ See Notice 2024-30, 2024-16 I.R.B. 878 (April 15, 2024), for \nadditional information regarding the energy community bonus credit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The IRA amended the phaseout of the section 45 credit for wind \nfacilities under section 45(b)(5) such that it does not apply to \nfacilities placed in service after December 31, 2021. The IRA also \nadded a new phaseout of the section 45 credit under section 45(b)(10) \nin the case of qualified facilities placed in service after December \n31, 2022, for taxpayers making an elective payment election under \nsection 6417. The IRA also amended the credit amount reduction under \nsection 45(b)(3) in the case of qualified facilities the construction \nof which began after August 16, 2022.\n    The IRA amended section 45(d)(4) to restore the section 45 credit \nfor electricity produced in solar energy facilities in the case of \nqualified facilities placed in service after December 31, 2021, and the \nconstruction of which began before January 1, 2025. Effective for \nfacilities placed in service after December 31, 2022, the IRA (1) \nremoved the one-half reduction of the credit amount under section \n45(b)(4)(A) for qualified hydropower facilities and marine and \nhydrokinetic renewable energy facilities and (2) amended the definition \nof marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy under section 45(c)(10) and \nthe definition of a marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy facility \nunder section 45(d)(11). The IRA also extended certain deadlines in the \ndefinitions under section 45(d) for wind facilities, closed-loop \nbiomass facilities, open-loop biomass facilities, geothermal \nfacilities, landfill gas facilities, trash facilities, qualified \nhydropower facilities, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy \nfacilities.\n    Credit Amount for a Qualified Facility Placed in Service before \nJanuary 1, 2022: As required by section 45(b)(2), the 1.5 cent amount \nprovided in section 45(a)(1) is adjusted by multiplying such amount by \nthe inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year in which the sale \noccurs. If any amount as increased under section 45(b)(2) is not a \nmultiple of 0.1 cent, such amount is rounded to the nearest multiple of \n0.1 cent. In the case of electricity produced in open-loop biomass \nfacilities, landfill gas facilities, trash facilities, qualified \nhydropower facilities, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy \nfacilities, section 45(b)(4)(A) requires the amount in effect under \nsection 45(a)(1) for such calendar year (before rounding to the nearest \n0.1 cent as required by section 45(b)(2)) to be reduced by one-half.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ As amended by the IRA and discussed later in this notice, \nthe one-half reduction under section 45(b)(4)(A) no longer applies \nto qualified hydropower facilities and marine and hydrokinetic \nrenewable energy facilities placed in service after December 31, \n2022.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Under the calculation required by section 45(b)(2), the credit for \nrenewable electricity production for calendar year 2025 determined \nunder section 45(a) is 3 cents per kilowatt hour on the sale of \nelectricity produced in any qualified facility placed in service before \nJanuary 1, 2022, from the qualified energy resources of wind, closed-\nloop biomass, and geothermal energy, and 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour on \nthe sale of electricity produced in any qualified facility placed in \nservice before January 1, 2022, from the qualified energy resources of \nopen-loop biomass, landfill gas, trash, qualified hydropower, and \nmarine and hydrokinetic renewable energy.\n    Credit Amount for a Qualified Facility Placed in Service after \nDecember 31, 2021: As required by section 45(b)(2), the 0.3 cent amount \nprovided in section 45(a)(1) is adjusted by multiplying such amount by \nthe inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year in which the sale \noccurs. If the 0.3 cent amount as adjusted for inflation is not a \nmultiple of 0.05 cent, the amount is rounded to the nearest multiple of \n0.05 cent. In the case of electricity produced in open-loop biomass \nfacilities, landfill gas facilities, trash facilities, qualified \nhydropower facilities, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy \nfacilities, section 45(b)(4)(A) requires the amount in effect under \nsection 45(a)(1) for such calendar year (determined before rounding as \nrequired by section 45(b)(2)) to be reduced by one-half.\n    Under the calculation required by section 45(b)(2), the credit for \nrenewable electricity production for calendar year 2025 determined \nunder section 45(a) is 0.6 cents per kilowatt hour on the sale of \nelectricity produced in any qualified facility placed in service after \nDecember 31, 2021, from the qualified energy resources of wind, closed-\nloop biomass, geothermal energy, and solar energy, and 0.3 cents per \nkilowatt hour on the sale of electricity produced in any\n\n[[Page 22440]]\n\nqualified facility placed in service after December 31, 2021, from the \nqualified energy resources of open-loop biomass, landfill gas, and \ntrash. The credit for renewable electricity production for calendar \nyear 2025 determined under section 45(a) is also 0.3 cents per kilowatt \nhour on the sale of electricity produced in any qualified facility \nplaced in service after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2023, \nfrom the qualified energy resources of qualified hydropower and marine \nand hydrokinetic renewable energy.\n    Credit Amount for Qualified Hydropower Facilities and Marine and \nHydrokinetic Renewable Energy Facilities Placed in Service After \nDecember 31, 2022: The one-half reduction under section 45(b)(4)(A) no \nlonger applies to qualified hydropower facilities and marine and \nhydrokinetic renewable energy facilities placed in service after \nDecember 31, 2022. Accordingly, under the calculation required by \nsection 45(b)(2), the credit for renewable electricity production for \ncalendar year 2025 determined under section 45(a) is 0.6 cents per \nkilowatt hour on the sale of electricity produced in any qualified \nfacility placed in service after December 31, 2022, from the qualified \nenergy resources of qualified hydropower and marine and hydrokinetic \nrenewable energy.\n\n(Authority: 45(e)(2)(A) (26 U.S.C. 45(e)(2)(A)) of the Internal \nRevenue Code.)\n\nChristopher T.

DOE noted that subsequent to \nadopting the final rule, it issued a guidance document that provided \nadditional information related to the implementation of these energy \nperformance standards. DOE also provided a link to the implementation \nguidance. Id. n2.\n    DOE has updated the implementation guidance document to include a \ncover page that states that DOE is currently reviewing the document and \nnoting that the compliance date for the energy performance standards \nhas been stayed. Adding the cover page required DOE to use a new URL to \npost the implementation guidance. Accordingly, the URL provided in the \nCompliance Date Stay is no longer accurate.\n    DOE is issuing this correction to update the URL provided in n2. \nBecause this document would simply update an URL, without changing the \nenergy performance standards adopted, the changes addressed in this \ndocument are technical in nature.\n    Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), DOE \nfinds that there is good cause to not issue a separate notice to \nsolicit public comment on the technical corrections contained in this \ndocument. Issuing a separate notice to solicit public comment would be \nunnecessary. As explained previously, the correction in this document \ndoes not affect the substance of or any of the conclusions reached in \nsupport of the final rule.

The MCAI states occurrences of lost \nsynchronization between RMPs were reported, and that these occurrences \nled to loss of communications means (RMP data synchronization and very \nhigh frequency (VHF) communications) on the digital radio and audio \nintegrating management system (DRAIMS). This condition, if not \ncorrected, could result in total loss of radio communications, \nincluding loss of transponder functionality and standby navigation.\n    Accordingly, EASA AD 2025-0037 describes procedures for revising \nthe existing AFM by providing instructions to address dual loss of RMP \ndata synchronization. The FAA has specified those instructions in \nfigure 1 and 2 to paragraph (g) of this AD. Where the figures refer to \nairplanes with Modification 162344, the figures also apply to airplanes \nwith Modification 168460 because Modification 162344 is a prerequisite \nfor modification 168460.\n    The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these \nproducts.\n    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under \nDocket No. FAA-2025-0913.\n\nFAA's Determination\n\n    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority \nof another country and are approved for operation in the United States. \nPursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design \nAuthority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition \ndescribed in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA is issuing this AD \nafter determining that the unsafe condition described previously is \nlikely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.\n\nRequirements of This AD\n\n    This AD requires revising the existing AFM by providing \ninstructions to address dual loss of RMP data synchronization.\n\nCompliance With AFM Revision\n\n    EASA AD 2025-0037 requires operators to ``inform all flight crews'' \nof revision to the AFM, and thereafter to ``operate the aeroplane \naccordingly.'' However, this AD does not specifically require that \naction as that action is already required by FAA regulations.\n    FAA regulations require that operators furnish to pilots any \nchanges to the AFM (for example, 14 CFR 121.137) and that pilots are \nfamiliar with the AFM (for example, 14 CFR 91.505). As with any other \nflightcrew training requirement, training on the updated AFM content is \ntracked by the operators and recorded in each pilot's training record, \nwhich is available for the FAA to review. FAA regulations also require \npilots to follow the procedures in the AFM including all updates. \nSection 91.9 requires that any person operating a civil aircraft must \ncomply with the operating limitations specified in the AFM.\n    Therefore, including a requirement in this AD to operate the \nairplane according to the revised AFM would be redundant and \nunnecessary.\n\nInterim Action\n\n    The FAA considers that this AD is an interim action. The design \napproval holder is currently developing a modification that will \naddress the unsafe condition identified in this AD. Once this \nmodification is developed, approved, and available, the FAA might \nconsider additional rulemaking.\n\n[[Page 22201]]\n\nJustification for Immediate Adoption and Determination of the Effective \nDate\n\n    Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. \n551 et seq.) authorizes agencies to dispense with notice and comment \nprocedures for rules when the agency, for ``good cause,'' finds that \nthose procedures are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the \npublic interest.'' Under this section, an agency, upon finding good \ncause, may issue a final rule without providing notice and seeking \ncomment prior to issuance. Further, section 553(d) of the APA \nauthorizes agencies to make rules effective in less than thirty days, \nupon a finding of good cause.\n    An unsafe condition exists that requires the immediate adoption of \nthis AD without providing an opportunity for public comments prior to \nadoption. The FAA has found that the risk to the flying public \njustifies forgoing notice and comment prior to adoption of this rule \nbecause lost synchronization between RMPs can lead to loss of \ncommunications means (RMP data synchronization and VHF communications) \non DRAIMS, which could result in total loss of radio communications, \ntransponder functionality, and standby navigation, impacting the \nflightcrew's ability to safely navigate, avoid air traffic collisions, \nand safely land the airplane. Additionally, the compliance time in this \nAD for the required action is 7 days, which is shorter than the time \nnecessary for the public to comment and for publication of the final \nrule. Accordingly, notice and opportunity for prior public comment are \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n553(b).\n    In addition, the FAA finds that good cause exists pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. 553(d) for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days, \nfor the same reasons the FAA found good cause to forgo notice and \ncomment.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)\n\n    The requirements of the RFA do not apply when an agency finds good \ncause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 to adopt a rule without prior notice and \ncomment. Because the FAA has determined that it has good cause to adopt \nthis rule without notice and comment, RFA analysis is not required.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\n    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 544 airplanes of U.S. \nregistry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:\n\n                  Estimated Costs for Required Actions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Cost per     Cost on U.S.\n          Labor cost            Parts cost     product      operators\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 work-hour x $85 per hour =            $0         $85          $46,240\n $85.........................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to \nissue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order \n13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, \non the relationship between the national government and the States, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \nlevels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866, and\n    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n\n\nSec.  39.13  [Amended]\n\n0\n2. The FAA amends Sec.  39.13 by adding the following new airworthiness \ndirective:\n\n2025-11-02 Airbus SAS: Amendment 39-23048; Docket No. FAA-2025-0913; \nProject Identifier MCAI-2025-00177-T.\n\n(a) Effective Date\n\n    This airworthiness directive (AD) is effective June 11, 2025.\n\n(b) Affected ADs\n\n    None.\n\n(c) Applicability\n\n    This AD applies to the Airbus SAS Model airplanes identified in \nparagraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this AD, certificated in any \ncategory, having Airbus modification 162344 or 168460, except for \nairplanes having Airbus modification 165670 installed in production.\n    (1) Model A319-151N, -153N, -171N, and -173N airplanes.\n    (2) Model A320-251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N \nairplanes.\n    (3) Model A321-251N, -251NX, -252N, -252NX, -253N, -253NX, -\n253NY, -271N, -271NX, -272N, and -272NX airplanes.\n\n(d) Subject\n\n    Air Transport Association (ATA) of America Code 23, \nCommunications.\n\n(e) Unsafe Condition\n\n    This AD was prompted by reports of lost synchronization between \nradio management panels (RMPs). The FAA is issuing this AD to \naddress loss of communications means (RMP data synchronization and \nvery high frequency (VHF) communications) on the digital radio and \naudio integrating management system (DRAIMS). This condition, if not \ncorrected, could result in total loss of radio communications, \nincluding transponder functionality and standby navigation.\n\n(f) Compliance\n\n    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, \nunless already done.\n\n(g) Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) Revision\n\n    Within 7 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the \nEmergency Procedures section of the existing AFM to include the\n\n[[Page 22202]]\n\ninformation in figure 1 or figure 2 to paragraph (g) of this AD, as \napplicable.

You may also contact the Rules and \nRegulations Group, Office of Policy, Federal Aviation Administration, \n800 Independence Avenue SW, Washington DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267-\n8783.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeffrey Claypool, Federal Aviation \nAdministration, Operations Support Group, Central Service Center, 10101 \nHillwood Parkway, Fort Worth, TX 76177; telephone (817) 222-5711.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is \nfound in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 \ndescribes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, \nAviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's \nauthority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described \nin Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, \nthe FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of \nairspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient \nuse of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority \nas it amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above \nthe surface at Park River Airport-W.C. Skjerven Field, Park River, ND, \nto support IFR operations at this airport.\n\nHistory\n\n    The FAA published an NPRM for Docket No. FAA-2023-2224 in the \nFederal Register (88 FR 83873; December 1, 2023) proposing to establish \nClass E airspace at Park River, ND. Interested parties were invited to \nparticipate in this rulemaking effort by submitting written comments on \nthe proposal to the FAA. No comments were received.\n\nIncorporation by Reference\n\n    Class E airspace designations are published in paragraph 6005 of \nFAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, which \nis incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This \ndocument amends the current version of that order, FAA Order JO \n7400.11J, dated July 31, 2024, and effective September 15, 2024. These \namendments will be published in the next update to FAA Order JO \n7400.11. FAA Order JO 7400.11J, which lists Class A, B, C, D, and E \nairspace areas, air traffic service routes, and reporting points, is \npublicly available as listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document.\n\nThe Rule\n\n    This amendment to 14 CFR part 71 modifies the Class E airspace \nextending upward from 700 feet above the surface to within a 6.3-mile \n(decreased from a 7-mile) radius of Park River Airport-W.C. Skjerven \nField, Park River, ND; and updates the name (previously Park River-W C \nSkjerven Field) to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.\n\nRegulatory Notices and Analyses\n\n    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an \nestablished\n\n[[Page 22204]]\n\nbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments \nare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) is \nnot a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; \n(2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and \nProcedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant \npreparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so \nminimal. Since this is a routine matter that only affects air traffic \nprocedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when \npromulgated, does not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities under the criteria of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nEnvironmental Review\n\n    The FAA has determined that this action qualifies for categorical \nexclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act in accordance \nwith FAA Order 1050.1F, ``Environmental Impacts: Policies and \nProcedures,'' paragraph 5-6.5.a. This airspace action is not expected \nto cause any potentially significant environmental impacts, and no \nextraordinary circumstances exist that warrant preparation of an \nenvironmental assessment.\n\nLists of Subjects in 14 CFR 71\n\n    Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).\n\nThe Amendment\n\n    In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows:\n\nPART 71--DESIGNATION OF CLASS A, B, C, D, AND E AIRSPACE AREAS; AIR \nTRAFFIC SERVICE ROUTES; AND REPORTING POINTS\n\n0\n1.

Table of Abbreviations\n\nCFR Code of Federal Regulations\nCOTP Captain of the Port, Sector Delaware Bay\nDHS Department of Homeland Security\nFR Federal Register\nNPRM Notice of proposed rulemaking\nPATCOM Patrol Commander\nSec.  Section\nU.S.C. United States Code\n\nII. Background Information and Regulatory History\n\n    The sponsor of an organized water event which is conducted \naccording to a prearranged schedule and which, by its nature, \ncircumstances or location, will introduce extra or unusual hazards to \nthe safety of life on the navigable waters of the United States must \nsubmit an application for a permit to the Coast Guard. 33 CFR 100.15. A \nCaptain of the Port, after approving plans for the holding of such a \nmarine event within his or her district or zone, is authorized to \npromulgate such special local regulations as he or she deems necessary \nto ensure the safety of life on the navigable waters immediately prior \nto, during and immediately after the approved event. 33 CFR 100.35.\n    The Captain of the Port, Sector Delaware Bay (COTP) has received an \napplication under 33 CFR 100.15 for a permit to host an offshore boat \nrace on June 8, 2025. The event will have 40 participating vessels and \napproximately 25 spectating vessels.\n    The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary rule under the authority \nin 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). This statutory provision authorizes an agency to \nissue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the \nagency for good cause finds that those procedures are ``impracticable, \nunnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' The Coast Guard \nfinds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed \nrulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because it is impracticable \nto do so. There is insufficient time to notice the rule, allow for a \nreasonable comment period, and publish a rule, given that the rule must \nbe in force by June 8, 2025, to serve its purpose. In addition, and on \nthe basis of impracticability for lack of time as well, the Coast Guard \nfinds that good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) for making this \nrule effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal \nRegister.\n\nIII. Legal Authority and Need for Rule\n\n    The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in 46 U.S.C. \n70041. The COTP has determined that the offshore boat race could pose a \nrisk to participants or waterway users if normal vessel traffic were \nallowed to interfere with the event. Possible hazards include risks of \nparticipant injury or death from\n\n[[Page 22206]]\n\nnear or actual collisions with non-participant vessels traversing \nthrough the regulated area.\n\nIV. Discussion of the Rule\n\n    This rule establishes a special local regulation from 10 a.m. until \n6 p.m. on June 8, 2025, to protect non-participants and participants in \nan offshore boat race. The regulated area covers all navigable waters \nof Atlantic Ocean near Atlantic City, NJ, within a polygon bounded by \nthe following: originating on the shore line at approximate position \nlatitude 39[deg]21'51'' N longitude 074[deg]24'26'' W; thence southeast \nto approximate position 39[deg]20'43'' N longitude 074[deg]24'04'' W; \nthence southwest to approximate position to latitude 39[deg]20'03'' N, \nlongitude 074[deg]26'29'' W; thence northwest to the shoreline at \napproximate position latitude 39[deg]20'49'' N, longitude \n074[deg]27'05'' W; thence northeast along the shoreline to the point of \norigin.\n    Inside of the regulated area detailed above there is a spectator \narea reserved for non-participant vessels to watch the event. The \nspectator area is within a polygon bounded by the following: beginning \nat approximate position latitude 39[deg]20'45'' N, longitude \n074[deg]25'33'' W; thence northeast to approximate position latitude \n39[deg]21'00'' N, longitude 074[deg]24'44'' W; thence southeast to \napproximate position latitude 39[deg]20'50'' N, longitude \n074[deg]24'39'' W; thence southwest to approximate position latitude \n39[deg]20'35'' N, longitude 074[deg]25'28'' W; thence northwest to the \npoint of origin.\n    The duration of the zone is intended to ensure the safety of \nparticipants and other waterway users before, during, and after the \nscheduled offshore boat race. No vessel or person will be permitted to \nenter the regulated area without obtaining permission from the COTP or \na designated representative.\n\nV. Regulatory Analyses\n\n    We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and \nExecutive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses \nbased on a number of these statutes and Executive orders.\n\nA. Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the \ncosts and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits. This rule has not been designated a ``significant \nregulatory action,'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. \nAccordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB).\n    This regulatory action determination is based on the size and \nduration of the regulated area, which would impact a small, designated \narea of the Atlantic Ocean. Vessels will be able to safely transit \naround the regulated area during the enforcement period. The Coast \nGuard will provide advance notification of the special local regulation \nto the local maritime community by Local Notice to Mariners and \nBroadcast Notice to Mariners.\n\nB. Impact on Small Entities\n\n    The regulatory flexibility analysis provisions of the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as amended, do not apply \nthis rule. They do not apply because this rule fits a 5 U.S.C. \n553(b)(B) good-cause exception for notice-and-comment rulemaking. \nTherefore, we were not required to publish a notice of proposed \nrulemaking.\n    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small \nentities in understanding this rule. If the rule would affect your \nsmall business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have \nquestions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please \ncall or email the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT \nsection.\n    Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal \nemployees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal \nregulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory \nEnforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory \nFairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and \nrates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to \ncomment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR \n(1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small \nentities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or \naction of the Coast Guard.\n\nC. Collection of Information\n\n    This rule will not call for a new collection of information under \nthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nD. Federalism and Indian Tribal Governments\n\n    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, \nFederalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on the \nrelationship between the National Government and the States, or on the \ndistribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of \ngovernment. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have \ndetermined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism \nprinciples and preemption requirements described in Executive Order \n13132.\n    Also, this rule does not have tribal implications under Executive \nOrder 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal \nGovernments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on \none or more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and \nresponsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes.\n\nE. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) \nrequires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary \nregulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may \nresult in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in \nthe aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for \ninflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in \nsuch an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere \nin this preamble.\n\nF. Environment\n\n    We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security \nDirective 023-01, Rev. 1, associated implementing instructions, and \nEnvironmental Planning COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast \nGuard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have determined that this action is one of \na category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a \nsignificant effect on the human environment. This rule involves a \nspecial local regulation lasting approximately 8 hours that will \nprohibit or restrict vessels entry within the regulated area during an \noffshore boat race. It is categorically excluded from further review \nunder paragraph L61 of Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS Instruction Manual \n023-01-001-01, Rev. 1. A Record of Environmental Consideration \nsupporting this determination is available in the docket. For \ninstructions on locating the docket, see the ADDRESSES section of this \npreamble.\n\nList of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 100\n\n    Marine safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements, Waterways.\n\n\n[[Page 22207]]\n\n\n    For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the Coast Guard amends \n33 CFR part 100 as follows:\n\nPART 100--SAFETY OF LIFE ON NAVIGABLE WATERS\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 100 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 46 U.S.C. 70041; 33 CFR 1.05-1.\n\n\n0\n2.

These coordinates are based on World Geodetic System (WGS 84).\n    (1) Spectator area. All navigable waters of Atlantic Ocean near \nAtlantic City, NJ, within a polygon inside the regulated area bounded \nby the following: beginning at approximate position latitude \n39[deg]20'45'' N, longitude 074[deg]25'33'' W; thence northeast to \napproximate position latitude 39[deg]21'00'' N, longitude \n074[deg]24'44'' W; thence southeast to approximate position latitude \n39[deg]20'50'' N, longitude 074[deg]24'39'' W; thence southwest to \napproximate position latitude 39[deg]20'35'' N, longitude \n074[deg]25'28'' W; thence northwest to the point of origin. These \ncoordinates are based on World Geodetic System (WGS 84).\n    (b) Definitions. As used in this section--\n    Captain of the Port Representative or COTP Representative means a \ncommissioned, warrant, or petty officer of the Coast Guard designated \nby name by the Captain of the Port to verify an event's compliance with \nthe conditions of its approved permit.\n    Event Patrol Commander or Event PATCOM means a commissioned, \nwarrant, or petty officer of the Coast Guard who has been designated by \nthe respective Coast Guard Sector--Captain of the Port to enforce the \nregulations in paragraph (d) of this section.\n    Non-participant means a person, or a vessel not registered with the \nevent sponsor either as a participant or an official patrol vessel.\n    Official patrol vessel or official patrol means any vessel assigned \nor approved by the respective Captain of the Port with a commissioned, \nwarrant, or petty officer on board and displaying a Coast Guard ensign, \nor any state or local law enforcement vessel approved by the Captain of \nthe Port in accordance with current local agreements.\n    Participant means any person or vessel registered with the event \nsponsor as participating in the event or otherwise designated by the \nevent sponsor as having a function tied to the event.\n    Spectator area means an area bound by coordinates provided in \nlatitude and longitude within the regulated area that outlines the \nboundary of an area reserved for non-participant vessels watching the \nevent.\n    (c) Patrol of the marine event. The COTP may assign one or more \nofficial patrol vessels, as described in Sec.  100.40, to the regulated \nevent. The Event PATCOM will be designated to oversee the patrol. The \npatrol vessel and the Event PATCOM may be contacted on VHF-FM Channel \n16. The Event PATCOM may terminate the event, or the operation of any \nvessel participating in the marine event, at any time if deemed \nnecessary for the protection of life or property.\n    (d) Regulations. (1) Controls on vessel movement. The Event PATCOM \nor official patrol vessel may forbid and control the movement of all \npersons and vessels in the regulated area(s). When hailed or signaled \nby an official patrol vessel, the person or vessel being hailed must \nimmediately comply with all directions given. Failure to do so may \nresult in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or \nboth.\n    (2) Directions, instructions, and minimum speed necessary.

Non-participants are only allowed inside the \nregulated area if they remain within a designated spectator area or \nhave authorization from the Event PATCOM or official patrol vessel to \ntransit through the area. A non-participant vessel must be stationary \nor operate at a safe speed while within the designated spectator area. \nOn scene official patrol vessels or the Event PATCOM will direct non-\nparticipant vessels to the spectator area. A non-participant must \ncontact the Event PATCOM or official patrol vessel to request \npermission to pass through the regulated area. If permission is \ngranted, the non-participant must pass directly through the regulated \narea at minimum speed necessary to maintain a safe course that \nminimizes wake and without loitering.\n    (4) Regulated area. Non-participants are only allowed inside the \nregulated area to pass through or enter and remain within a designated \nspectator area. A non-participant must contact the Event PATCOM or an \nofficial patrol vessel to request permission to either enter the \nspectator area or pass through the regulated area.

Table of Abbreviations\n\nCFR Code of Federal Regulations\nCOTP Captain of the Port, Sector Delaware Bay\nDHS Department of Homeland Security\nFR Federal Register\nNPRM Notice of proposed rulemaking\nSec.  Section\nU.S.C. United States Code\n\nII. Background Information and Regulatory History\n\n    The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary rule under the authority \nin 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). This statutory provision authorizes an agency to \nissue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the \nagency for good cause finds that those procedures are ``impracticable, \nunnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' The Coast Guard \nfinds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed \nrulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because it is impracticable \nto do so. There is insufficient time to notice the rule, allow for a \nreasonable comment period, and publish a rule, given that the rule must \nbe in force by July 4, 2025, to serve its purpose.\n\nIII. Legal Authority and Need for Rule\n\n    The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in 46 U.S.C. \n70034. The COTP has determined that the potential hazards associated \nwith a barge-based fireworks display will be a safety concern for \nanyone within 300 yards of the barge. The purpose of this rule is to \nensure the safety of vessels and people in the navigable waters in the \nsafety zone before, during, and after a barge-based fireworks display.\n\nIV. Discussion of the Rule\n\n    The COTP is establishing a safety zone which will be enforced from \n9 p.m. through 10 p.m. on July 4, 2025, or a rain date of July 5, 2025, \nor a rain date of July 5, 2025, from 9 p.m. through 10 p.m. The COTP, \nor a designated representative, will inform the public through written \nLocal Notice to Mariners, Broadcast Notice to Mariners via VHF-FM \nmarine channel 16, of any adjustments to the enforcement periods of the \nsafety zone. The safety zone will cover all navigable waters within 300 \nyards of a barge on the Delaware River located near Pleasant Hill Park, \nin Philadelphia, PA. The coordinates of the safety zone are provided in \nthe proposed language of the rule, below. The duration of the zone is \nintended to ensure the safety of vessels and these navigable waters \nbefore, during, and after the scheduled 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. fireworks \ndisplay. No vessel or person would be permitted to enter the safety \nzone without obtaining permission from the COTP or a designated \nrepresentative.\n\nV. Regulatory Analyses\n\n    We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and \nExecutive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses \nbased on a number of these statutes and Executive orders.\n\nA. Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the \ncosts and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits. This rule has not been designated a ``significant \nregulatory action,'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. \nAccordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB).\n    This regulatory action determination is based on the following \nfactors: (1) although persons and vessels may not enter, transit \nthrough, anchor in, or remain within the safety zone without \nauthorization from the COTP or a designated representative, they may \noperate in the surrounding area during the enforcement period; (2) \npersons and vessels will still be able to enter, transit through, \nanchor in, or remain within the regulated area if authorized by the \nCOTP; and (3) the Coast Guard will provide advance notification of the \nsafety zone to the local maritime community by Local Notice to Mariners \nand Broadcast Notice to Mariners.\n\nB. Impact on Small Entities\n\n    The regulatory flexibility analysis provisions of the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as amended, do not apply \nthis rule. They do not apply because this rule fits a 5 U.S.C. \n553(b)(B) good-cause exception for notice-and-comment rulemaking. \nTherefore, we were not required to publish a notice of proposed \nrulemaking.\n    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small \nentities in understanding this rule. If the rule would affect your \nsmall business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have \nquestions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please \ncall or email the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT \nsection.\n    Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal \nemployees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal \nregulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory \nEnforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory \nFairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and \nrates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to \ncomment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR \n(1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small \nentities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or \naction of the Coast Guard.\n\nC. Collection of Information\n\n    This rule will not call for a new collection of information under \nthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nD. Federalism and Indian Tribal Governments\n\n    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, \nFederalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on the \nrelationship between the National Government and the States, or on the \ndistribution of power and responsibilities among the\n\n[[Page 22209]]\n\nvarious levels of government. We have analyzed this rule under that \nOrder and have determined that it is consistent with the fundamental \nfederalism principles and preemption requirements described in \nExecutive Order 13132.\n    Also, this rule does not have tribal implications under Executive \nOrder 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal \nGovernments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on \none or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and \nresponsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.\n\nE. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) \nrequires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary \nregulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may \nresult in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in \nthe aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for \ninflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in \nsuch an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere \nin this preamble.\n\nF. Environment\n\n    We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security \nDirective 023-01, Rev. 1, associated implementing instructions, and \nEnvironmental Planning COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast \nGuard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have determined that this action is one of \na category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a \nsignificant effect on the human environment. This rule involves a \nsafety zone lasting approximately 1 hour that will prohibit entry \nwithin 300 yards of a fireworks barge. It is categorically excluded \nfrom further review under paragraph L60(a) of Appendix A, Table 1 of \nDHS Instruction Manual 023-01-001-01, Rev. 1. A Record of Environmental \nConsideration supporting this determination is available in the docket. \nFor instructions on locating the docket, see the ADDRESSES section of \nthis preamble.\n\nList of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 165\n\n    Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements, Security measures, Waterways.\n\n    For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the Coast Guard amends \n33 CFR part 165 as follows:\n\nPART 165--REGULATED NAVIGATION AREAS AND LIMITED ACCESS AREAS\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 165 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  46 U.S.C. 70034, 70051, 70124; 33 CFR 1.05-1, 6.04-\n1, 6.04-6, and 160.5; Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. \n00170.1, Revision No. 01.3.\n\n\n0\n2. Add Sec.  165.T05-0184 to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  165.T05-0184  Safety Zone; Fireworks Display, Delaware River, \nPhiladelphia, PA.\n\n    (a) Location. All navigable waters within 300 yards of a barge in \nthe Delaware River located at approximate position latitude \n40[deg]2'22'' N longitude 074[deg]59'22.67'' W.\n    (b) Definitions. As used in this section, designated representative \nmeans a Coast Guard Patrol Commander, including a Coast Guard petty \nofficer, warrant or commissioned officer on board a Coast Guard vessel \nor on board a federal, state, or local law enforcement vessel assisting \nthe Captain of the Port (COTP), Sector Delaware Bay in the enforcement \nof the safety zone.\n    (c) Regulations. (1) Under the general safety zone regulations in \nsubpart C of this part, you may not enter the safety zone described in \nparagraph (a) of this section unless authorized by the COTP or the \nCOTP's designated representative.\n    (2) To seek permission to enter or remain in the zone, contact the \nCOTP or the COTP's representative via VHF-FM channel 16 or 215-271-\n4807. Those in the safety zone must comply with all lawful orders or \ndirections given to them by the COTP or the COTP's designated \nrepresentative.\n    (3) No vessel may take on bunkers or conduct lightering operations \nwithin the safety zone during its enforcement period.\n    (4) This section applies to all vessels except those engaged in law \nenforcement, aids to navigation servicing, and emergency response \noperations.\n    (d) Enforcement. The U.S. Coast Guard may be assisted in the patrol \nand enforcement of the safety zone by Federal, State, and local \nagencies.\n    (e) Enforcement period. This zone will be enforced from \napproximately 9 p.m. through 10 p.m. on July 4, 2025, or a rain date of \nJuly 5, 2025.\n\n    Dated: May 14, 2025.\nKate F.

Table of Abbreviations\n\nCFR Code of Federal Regulations\nDHS Department of Homeland Security\nFR Federal Register\nNPRM Notice of proposed rulemaking\nSec.  Section\nU.S.C. United States Code\n\nII. Background Information and Regulatory History\n\n    The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary rule under the authority \nin 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). This statutory provision authorizes an agency to \nissue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the \nagency for good cause finds that those procedures are ``impracticable, \nunnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' The Coast Guard \nfinds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed \nrulemaking (NPRM)\n\n[[Page 22210]]\n\nwith respect to this rule because the event sponsor did not notify the \nCoast Guard with sufficient time to publish an NPRM and immediate \naction is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine \nenvironment in the Detroit River. It is impracticable and contrary to \nthe public interest to publish a NPRM because we must establish this \nsafety zone by June 28, 2025.\n    Also, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good \ncause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after \npublication in the Federal Register. For the same reasons discussed in \nthe preceding paragraph, delaying the effective date of this rule would \nbe impracticable because immediate action is needed to respond to the \npotential safety hazards associated with a fireworks display.\n\nIII. Legal Authority and Need for Rule\n\n    The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in 46 U.S.C. \n70034. The Captain of the Port Detroit (COTP) has determined that \npotential hazards associated with fireworks displays will be a safety \nconcern for anyone within a 200-yard radius of the launch site. The \nlikely combination of recreational vessels, darkness punctuated by \nbright flashes of light, and fireworks debris falling into the water \npresents risks of collisions which could result in serious injuries or \nfatalities. This rule is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and \nthe marine environment in the navigable waters within the safety zone \nduring the fireworks display.\n\nIV. Discussion of the Rule\n\n    This rule establishes a safety zone from 9 p.m. through 11 p.m. on \nJune 28, 2025. The safety zone will encompass all U.S. navigable waters \nof the Detroit River within a 200-yard radius of the fireworks launch \nsite located near the public launch site, in Detroit, MI. The duration \nof the zone is intended to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine \nenvironment in these navigable waters during the fireworks display. \nEntry into, transiting, or anchoring within the safety zone is \nprohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Detroit or his \ndesignated representative. The Captain of the Port Detroit or his \ndesignated representative may be contacted via VHF Channel 16.\n\nV. Regulatory Analyses\n\n    We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and \nExecutive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses \nbased on a number of these statutes and Executive orders.\n\nA. Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the \ncosts and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits. This rule has not been designated a ``significant \nregulatory action,'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. \nAccordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB).\n    This regulatory action determination is based on the size, \nlocation, and duration of the safety zone. Vessel traffic will be able \nto safely transit around this safety zone which would impact a small, \ndesignated area of the Detroit River 2 hours during the evening when \nvessel traffic is normally low. Moreover, the Coast Guard would issue a \nBroadcast Notice to Mariners via VHF-FM Marine Channel 16 about the \nzone, and the rule would allow vessels to seek permission to enter the \nzone.\n\nB. Impact on Small Entities\n\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as \namended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of \nregulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term ``small \nentities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations \nthat are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their \nfields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than \n50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule \nwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities.\n    While some owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the \nsafety zone may be small entities, for the reasons stated in section \nV.A above, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on any \nvessel owner or operator.\n    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small \nentities in understanding this rule. If the rule will affect your small \nbusiness, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have \nquestions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please \ncall or email the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT \nsection.\n    Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal \nemployees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal \nregulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory \nEnforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory \nFairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and \nrates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to \ncomment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR \n(1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small \nentities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or \naction of the Coast Guard.\n\nC. Collection of Information\n\n    This rule will not call for a new collection of information under \nthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nD. Federalism and Indian Tribal Governments\n\n    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, \nFederalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on the \nrelationship between the National Government and the States, or on the \ndistribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of \ngovernment. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have \ndetermined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism \nprinciples and preemption requirements described in Executive Order \n13132.\n    Also, this rule does not have tribal implications under Executive \nOrder 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal \nGovernments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on \none or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and \nresponsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.\n\nE. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) \nrequires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary \nregulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may \nresult in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in \nthe aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for \ninflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in \nsuch an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere \nin this preamble.\n\nF. Environment\n\n    We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security \nDirective 023-01, Rev. 1, associated implementing instructions, and \nEnvironmental Planning COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast \nGuard in complying with the National\n\n[[Page 22211]]\n\nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have \ndetermined that this action is one of a category of actions that do not \nindividually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human \nenvironment. This rule involves a safety zone lasting only 2 hours that \nwill prohibit entry within 200-yard radius of where the fireworks \ndisplay will be conducted. It is categorically excluded from further \nreview under paragraph L60(a)60 of Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS \nInstruction Manual 023-01-001-01, Rev. 1. A Record of Environmental \nConsideration supporting this determination is available in the docket. \nFor instructions on locating the docket, see the ADDRESSES section of \nthis preamble.\n\nList of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 165\n\n    Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and record \nkeeping requirements, Security measures, Waterways.\n\n    For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the Coast Guard amends \n33 CFR part 165 as follows:\n\nPART 165--REGULATED NAVIGATION AREAS AND LIMITED ACCESS AREAS\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 165 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 46 U.S.C. 70034, 70051, 70124; 33 CFR 1.05-1, 6.04-1, \n6.04-6, and 160.5; Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. \n00170.1, Revision No. 01.3.\n\n\n0\n2.

Public Participation\n\n    Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking \nby submitting written views, opinions, recommendations, and data on the \ninterim final rule published on September 11, 2024 (89 FR 73592). Two \ncomments were submitted to the rulemaking docket during the 30-day \ncomment period, both from interested individuals who are not members of \nthe WTC Health Program. The two comments are summarized in Section III.\n\nII. Background\n\n    Title I of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of \n2010 (Zadroga Act), as amended, revised the Public Health Service Act \n(PHS Act) to establish the WTC Health Program (Program), which is \nadministered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and \nHealth (NIOSH), within CDC. The WTC Health Program provides medical \nmonitoring and treatment to eligible responders to the September 11, \n2001, terrorist attacks in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in \nShanksville, Pennsylvania, and to eligible survivors of the New York \nCity attacks. In this rulemaking, the Administrator of the WTC Health \nProgram and the Secretary of HHS finalize revisions of the implementing \nregulation for the Program to align with the statutory changes to the \nPHS Act.\n\nA. WTC Health Program Statutory Authority\n\n    Title I of the Zadroga Act \\1\\ (Pub. L. 111-347, as amended by Pub. \nL. 114-113, Pub. L. 116-59, Pub. L. 117-328, and Pub. L. 118-31) added \nTitle XXXIII to the PHS Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. 300mm-300mm-64, \nestablishing the WTC Health Program within HHS. All references to the \nAdministrator in this document mean the Director of NIOSH, within CDC, \nor his or her designee.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Those portions of the Zadroga Act found in titles II and III \nof Public Law 111-347 do not pertain to the WTC Health Program and \nare codified elsewhere.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Regulatory Background\n\n    Following the enactment of the Zadroga Act, the HHS Secretary \npromulgated 42 CFR part 88 to establish implementing regulations for \nthe WTC Health Program within NIOSH. The Zadroga Act prescribed \neligibility criteria for Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania \nresponders and required the Administrator to establish the dates\n\n[[Page 22212]]\n\non which cleanup was concluded at the Pentagon and Shanksville sites, \nrespectively.\\2\\ The Administrator promulgated the eligibility criteria \nand cleanup dates in 42 CFR 88.4(b) and (c) through a rulemaking \npublished on March 28, 2013.\\3\\ Following the rulemaking, eligible \nPentagon and Shanksville responders include those individuals who:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ 42 U.S.C. 300mm-21(a)(2)(C)(i)(I) and (II).\n    \\3\\ World Trade Center Health Program Eligibility Requirements \nfor Shanksville, Pennsylvania and Pentagon Responders, Interim Final \nRule, 78 FR 18855, March 28, 2013.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> Were active or retired members of a fire or police \ndepartment (fire or emergency personnel), worked for a recovery or \ncleanup contractor, or were volunteers; and\n    <bullet> Performed rescue, recovery, demolition, debris cleanup, or \nother related services, either at the Pentagon site of the September \n11, 2001, terrorist attacks, for at least 1 day beginning September 11, \n2001, and ending on November 19, 2001, or at the Shanksville, \nPennsylvania site for at least 1 day beginning September 11, 2001, and \nending on October 3, 2001.\n    Since 2013, the WTC Health Program has enrolled 1,544 Pentagon \nresponders and Shanksville, Pennsylvania responders, combined but not \nincluding those new members enrolled pursuant to the September 11, 2024 \ninterim final rule.\n    In 2023, Congress identified a gap in coverage for the population \nof employees of the Department of Defense (DOD) or other Federal \nagencies, certain DOD and Federal agency contractors, and regular or \nreserve uniformed service members who responded to the Pentagon and \nShanksville sites; these personnel did not previously meet the \nstatutory eligibility criteria in the Zadroga Act because of their \nspecific types of employment. Congress included language to address \nthese coverage gaps and expand eligibility criteria for responders at \nthe Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania sites in the National \nDefense Authorization Act, 2024 (Pub. L. 118-31, December 22, 2023) \n(2024 NDAA).\n    On September 11, 2024, the Administrator of the WTC Health Program \nand the HHS Secretary amended part 88 to operationalize changes to \nTitle XXXIII of the PHS Act due to the 2024 NDAA. The agency published \nan interim final rule with immediate effective date to quickly \nimplement the expanded eligibility criteria for Pentagon and \nShanksville responders. Specifically, the amendments to WTC Health \nProgram regulations in 42 CFR part 88 made by the interim final rule \nincluded expanding eligibility criteria for Pentagon and Shanksville \nresponders, adding a numerical limit on Pentagon and Shanksville \nresponders enrolled under the new eligibility criteria, updating the \nlanguage in the regulation regarding the numerical limit on certain \nnewly enrolled WTC responders and certified-eligible survivors, and \nupdating and adding new definitions. An interim final rulemaking was \nconducted because the agency determined that there was good cause to \nwaive public notice and comment prior to publication as the rulemaking \nmerely implemented the statutory changes. The agency determined it \nwould have been contrary to the public interest to delay the ability of \neligible individuals to access treatment for health conditions related \nto their 9/11 response activities. No opposition to the expanded \neligibility requirements was anticipated and the agency did not \nexercise any discretion in further defining certain employees who may \nbe eligible for the Program or clarify any additional limits on the \nnumber of individuals from these categories who would be eligible. \nPostponement of the implementation of the new eligibility criteria \ncould have resulted in harm to Pentagon and Shanksville responders \ncurrently coping with one or more health conditions covered by the WTC \nHealth Program or who are at risk for developing such a condition. \nThus, notice and comment procedures were waived in the interest of \nprotecting the health of these responders and allowing them to apply \nfor enrollment in the WTC Health Program as soon as possible. Since \npublication of the interim final rule, the Administrator of the WTC \nHealth Program welcomed 69 new members pursuant to the expanded \neligibility criteria as of April 23, 2025. The interim final rule \npublic comment period and Paperwork Reduction Act emergency information \ncollection request were open for 30 days, until October 11, 2024.\n\nIII. Summary of Public Comments\n\n    On September 11, 2024, the Administrator of the WTC Health Program \nand the HHS Secretary published an interim final rule operationalizing \nthe 2024 NDAA amendments and expanding those groups eligible for \nenrollment as responders at the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania \nsites. Two public comments were submitted to the rulemaking docket, \nboth supportive of the rulemaking.\n    Public comment: Of the two supportive public comments, one \nexpressed disappointment that the number of new Pentagon and \nShanksville enrollees is capped at 500 and asked for the agency's \nrationale.\n    Agency response: As discussed above, Congress enacted the 2024 NDAA \nto amend Title XXXIII of the PHS Act to expand eligibility criteria for \nresponders to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks at the Pentagon \nand Shanksville, Pennsylvania sites. NDAA amendments codified in 42 \nU.S.C. 300mm-22(a)(4)(A)(ii) specify that the ``total number of \nindividuals who may be enrolled under [the expanded eligibility \ncriteria] shall not exceed 500 at any time.'' Accordingly, the agency \nhas no discretion to increase or decrease that limit in WTC Health \nProgram regulations and no change has been made in response to this \ncomment.\n\nIV. Summary of Final Rule\n\n    No changes have been made to the final regulatory text, either in \nresponse to public comment or at the agency's discretion. With this \nrulemaking, and for the reasons discussed in the interim final rule, \namendments to 42 CFR part 88 are finalized as described below.\n\nAuthority Citation\n\n    The authority citation for 42 CFR part 88 was updated to reflect \nrecent amendments to Title I of the Zadroga Act (Pub. L. 111-347, as \namended by Pub. L. 114-113, Pub. L. 116-59, Pub. L. 117-328, and Pub. \nL. 118-31). The statutory citation now reads 42 U.S.C. 300mm-300mm-64.\nSection 88.1 Definitions\n    The statutory definitions of the terms Federal agency and uniformed \nservices were added to the existing Definitions section, 42 CFR 88.1. \nIn the existing definitions of Act and WTC Health Program, the \nstatutory authority citation was updated to reflect recent amendments \nto the Zadroga Act.\nSection 88.4 Eligibility Criteria--WTC Responders\n    The existing Pentagon responder eligibility criteria in 42 CFR \n88.4(b) were modified to include the new statutory criteria for the \nthree new classes of eligible responders at the Pentagon site. For \nclarity, the existing language in paragraph (b)(1) identifying classes \nof eligible Pentagon responders was broken into new paragraphs, \ndesignated (b)(1)(i) through (iii). New paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) through \n(vi) were added to include the three new classes of eligible Pentagon \nresponders. New paragraph (b)(1)(iv) identifies employees\n\n[[Page 22213]]\n\nof the DOD or any other Federal agency; paragraph (b)(1)(v) identifies \nemployees of DOD contractors or other Federal agency contractors who \nworked during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on \nSeptember 18, 2001; and paragraph (b)(1)(vi) identifies members of \nregular and reserve components of the uniformed services. Language in \nexisting Sec.  88.4(b)(2) describing eligible response activities, time \nperiods, and duration of work was split into two paragraphs, resulting \nin a revised paragraph (b)(2) and a new paragraph (b)(3).\n    The existing Shanksville, Pennsylvania responder eligibility \ncriteria in Sec.  88.4(c) were also revised to add the new statutory \ncriteria for the three new classes of eligible responders at the \nShanksville, Pennsylvania site. For clarity, the existing language \nidentifying classes of eligible Shanksville responders in paragraph \n(c)(1) was broken into new paragraphs, designated (c)(1)(i) through \n(iii). New paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) through (vi) were added to include the \nthree new classes of eligible Shanksville responders. New paragraph \n(c)(1)(iv) identifies employees of the DOD or any other Federal agency; \nparagraph (c)(1)(v) identifies employees of DOD contractors or other \nFederal agency contractors who worked during the period beginning on \nSeptember 11, 2001, and ending on September 18, 2001; and paragraph \n(c)(1)(vi) identifies members of regular and reserve components of the \nuniformed services. Language in existing paragraph (c)(2) describing \neligible response activities, time periods, and duration of work was \nsplit into two paragraphs, resulting in a revised paragraph (c)(2) and \na new paragraph (c)(3).\nSection 88.6 Enrollment Decision--WTC Responders\n    In 42 CFR 88.6, existing paragraph (c) establishes conditions under \nwhich the WTC Health Program may deny enrollment of responders. In \nparagraph (c)(2)(i), the numerical limit on new WTC responder \nenrollment was replaced with new language indicating that this limit is \nestablished in the Zadroga Act, as amended. Language in paragraph \n(c)(2)(i) describing the Administrator's discretion regarding whether \nto close Program enrollment in the event that sufficient funds are not \navailable to enroll new members was moved to a new paragraph \n(c)(2)(iii) without change. New text in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) reflects \nthe new statutory limit of 500 total WTC responders who may be enrolled \npursuant to the expanded Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania \neligibility criteria in Sec. Sec.  88.4(b)(1)(iv) through (vi) and \n88.4(c)(1)(iv) through (vi), respectively.\nSection 88.12 Enrollment Decision--Certified-Eligible Survivors\n    In 42 CFR 88.12, existing paragraph (b)(3) establishes conditions \nunder which the WTC Health Program may deny certified-eligible survivor \nstatus. The numerical limit in paragraph (b)(3)(i) was replaced with \nnew language indicating that the limit on certified-eligible survivor \nenrollment is specified in the Zadroga Act, as amended. Language in \nexisting paragraph (b)(3)(i), describing the Administrator's discretion \nregarding whether to close Program enrollment in the event that \nsufficient funds are not available to enroll new members, was moved to \na new paragraph (b)(3)(ii) without change.\n\nList of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 88\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Cancer, Diseases, \nFirefighters, Health, Health care, Mental health programs, Law \nenforcement officers, Lung diseases, Occupational safety and health, \nVolunteers, Workers' compensation.\n    Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 42 CFR part 88, which \npublished on September 11, 2024 (89 FR 73592), is adopted as a final \nrule without change.\n\nJohn J.

Executive Summary\n\nA. Does this action apply to me?\n\n    You may be potentially affected by this rule if you use methylene \nchloride in a laboratory setting for the following activities; the \nindustrial or commercial use of methylene chloride in a laboratory \nprocess or in specialized laboratory equipment for instrument \ncalibration/maintenance; chemical analysis, chemical synthesis, \nextracting and purifying other chemicals; dissolving other substances; \nexecuting research, development, test and evaluation methods; and \nsimilar activities, such as use as a solvent, reagent, analytical \nstandard, or other experimental use. For the purposes of this proposed \nrulemaking, EPA emphasizes that industrial and commercial use of \nmethylene chloride as a laboratory chemical applies to all \nlaboratories, including industrial, commercial, academic and research \nlaboratories, except for those laboratories owned or operated by a \nFederal agency or a Federal contractor acting on behalf of the Federal \ngovernment for research, government, and academic institutions. Under \nthe following list of North American Industrial Classification System \n(NAICS) codes, potentially affected entities may include:\n    <bullet> Testing Laboratories (NAICS code 541380);\n    <bullet> Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and \nLife Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology (NAICS code \n541715);\n    <bullet> Hazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal (NAICS code \n562211);\n    <bullet> Solid Waste Combustors and Incinerators (NAICS code \n562213);\n\nB. What is the agency's authority for taking this action?\n\n    Under TSCA section 6(a) (15 U.S.C. 2605(a)), if EPA determines \nthrough a TSCA section 6(b) risk evaluation that a chemical substance \npresents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment \nfor one or more condition(s) of use.\n    With the obligation to promulgate these rules, the Agency also has \nthe inherent authority to amend them if circumstances change, including \nbased on the receipt of new information and in relation to compliance \ndeadlines established under TSCA section 6(d). It is well settled that \nEPA has inherent authority to reconsider, revise, or repeal past \ndecisions to the extent permitted by law so long as the Agency provides \na reasoned explanation. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 \nU.S. 502, 515 (2009); see also FDA v. Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C., \n145 S. Ct. 898, slip op. at 20 (2025). Here, as explained further in \nUnit I.D., based on information submitted by regulated entities, the \nAgency proposes that revised compliance dates are necessary to address \nrecently-received information that the original compliance dates for \nlaboratories not owned or operated by Federal agencies, or Federal \ncontractors acting on behalf of the Federal government, are not \npracticable and do not provide adequate transition time because they \ndisrupt environmental monitoring and associated laboratory-based \nactivities discussed further in Unit II.C.3.\n\nC. What action is the agency taking?\n\n    EPA is proposing to amend the regulations at 40 CFR 751.109 to \nextend the WCPP compliance dates for the industrial or commercial use \nof\n\n[[Page 22215]]\n\nmethylene chloride as a laboratory chemical, established in the May \n2024 final rule (Ref. 1), for an additional 18 months to match the \ncompliance dates for Federal agencies and their contractors. \nSpecifically, for laboratories not owned or operated by Federal \nagencies, or Federal contractors acting on behalf of the Federal \ngovernment, this proposal would extend the compliance date for initial \nmonitoring from May 5, 2025 to November 9, 2026, the compliance date \nfor establishing regulated areas and ensuring compliance with the \nExisting Chemical Exposure Limit (ECEL) from August 1, 2025 to February \n8, 2027, and the compliance date for ensuring the methods of compliance \nas well as developing and implementing an exposure control plan from \nOctober 30, 2025, to May 10, 2027.\n    The May 2024 final rule for methylene chloride (Ref. 1) prohibits \nthe manufacture (including import), processing, use, and distribution \nof methylene chloride and methylene chloride-containing products for \nall consumer use and most industrial and commercial uses, with \nspecified exclusions; requires owners and operators of workplaces \nengaged in the manufacture, processing, and use of methylene chloride \nfor permitted uses to comply with a Workplace Chemical Protection \nProgram (WCPP) to reduce exposures; and requires persons manufacturing, \nprocessing, or distributing in commerce methylene chloride and products \ncontaining methylene chloride to notify their customers of these \nprohibitions and restrictions. The compliance dates for the \nprohibitions began as early as February 3, 2025, while the first \ncompliance date for the WCPP provisions is May 5, 2025, for initial \nexposure monitoring (Ref. 1).\n    EPA is interested in receiving new specific information that was \nnot accessible during the proposed or final rulemaking on the barriers \nto WCPP compliance for different kinds of laboratories, and in any \ninformation that shows the exposure reductions that fume hoods or other \nenclosures currently in use in laboratories provide to address risks \nsuch that they are no longer unreasonable. EPA seeks comment on these \ncompliance difficulties and on legitimate reliance interests, if any, \non the original deadlines, that the Agency should consider in the \ncourse of this limited rulemaking. EPA notes that it has not, and is \nnot, reopening the entirety of the methylene chloride final rule by \nissuing this proposal. Accordingly, EPA requests that commenters limit \ntheir submissions to the laboratory compliance deadline issues raised \nin this proposed rule.\n\nD. Why is the agency taking this action?\n\n    EPA is issuing this proposal to address the unanticipated hardships \nthat were inadvertently created for laboratories by the May 2024 final \nrule on methylene chloride (Ref. 1) due to the widespread, often \nmandatory, use of methylene chloride as a laboratory chemical that was \nnot fully understood by EPA before the rule was published. Although EPA \nresponded to comments and revised provisions of the final rule in \nconsideration of commenter's concerns on laboratory use of methylene \nchloride, shortly after the final rule was published in May 2024, many \nrepresentatives of various laboratories using methylene chloride began \ncontacting EPA with questions about the applicability of the rule, \ndifficulties in complying with the requirements of the WCPP, and other \nconcerns (Ref. 1). Many of these laboratories, especially those \nassociated with local governments or universities, use methylene \nchloride in small quantities and somewhat infrequently (Refs. 2, 3). \nFor example, one police department submitted a post-rulemaking inquiry \nto EPA to discuss their use of methylene chloride in the detection of \ncontrolled substances. Several universities contacted EPA to ask about \nhow the rule applies to their activities, such as solvent extractions \nperformed by students in an organic chemistry laboratory (Refs. 4, 5, \n6, 7, 8). Several of the university laboratories that contacted EPA \nindicated that their use of methylene chloride occurred exclusively \nunder a fume hood. They questioned whether initial monitoring would \nstill be required, and whether initial monitoring would have to be done \nfor each fume hood in use on the campus (Refs. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8).\n    Environmental monitoring laboratories also contacted EPA shortly \nafter the final rule was published. They provided additional \ninformation on the various EPA test methods and voluntary consensus \nstandards used in compliance testing that require the use of methylene \nchloride, including methods that are part of EPA's SW-846 Hazardous \nWaste Test Methods Compendium (available online at <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/hw-sw846\">https://www.epa.gov/hw-sw846</a>), such as Method 0010, used in the determination of \ndestruction and removal efficiency of semivolatile principal organic \nhazardous compounds (POHCs) from incineration systems or the \ndetermination of particulate emission rates from stationary sources \n(Refs. 9, 10, 11). In the view of these laboratories, EPA should not be \nimposing the burden of the TSCA WCPP on laboratories that are using \nmethylene chloride pursuant to EPA methods mandated for use by other \nregulatory programs. Rather, these laboratories believe that EPA should \nfirst revise its mandatory analytical methods that require the use of \nmethylene chloride to allow for the use of other solvents, or other \ntechniques that would reduce methylene chloride use by environmental \nmonitoring laboratories. These laboratories also have concerns about \ntheir ability to meet the TSCA rule's requirements to perform initial \nmonitoring of potentially exposed person's exposures by the compliance \ndeadline.\n    While EPA received several comments along these lines during the \npublic comment period on the proposed rule, EPA was not aware of the \nbreadth of laboratories needing to comply with the WCPP as a result of \nmandatory EPA methods that require the use of methylene chloride to \nperform the analysis, posing unique compliance challenges when combined \nwith other requirements of the WCPP such as conducting exposure \nmonitoring, developing exposure control plans, and assess and acquire \nnecessary PPE based on the exposure monitoring.\n\nE. What are the incremental economic impacts?\n\n    EPA evaluated the potential incremental economic impacts and \ndetermined that these changes would have minimal impacts on the \nestimated costs and benefits of the existing action and would primarily \nresult in a delay in when those costs and benefits begin accruing. \nQuantified costs are expected to be the same as estimated in the final \nrule but will not be incurred until the proposed compliance date \nextension expires. The extension would also postpone when decreases in \npotential exposures to methylene chloride in laboratory settings and \ndelay when potential benefits begin to accrue. On balance, this \nproposed further extension of the compliance dates is appropriate to \nprevent the disruptive consequences of requiring laboratories to begin \nimplementing the WCPP by May 5, 2025, without a further compliance \nextension.\n\nII. Background\n\nA. The May 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\n    1. Summary of the notice of proposed rulemaking. In May 2023, EPA \nproposed a rule under TSCA section 6(a) to address unreasonable risk of \ninjury to\n\n[[Page 22216]]\n\nhuman health presented by methylene chloride under 52 of its 53 total \nconditions of use (Ref. 10). In the 2023 notice of proposed rulemaking \n(Ref. 10), EPA noted that methylene chloride was a widely used solvent \nin a variety of commercial and consumer applications and has a number \nof known health effects that may result from exposure. As described in \nmore detail in EPA's proposed rule and as described in the TSCA section \n6(b) 2020 Risk Evaluation for Methylene Chloride, EPA identified non-\ncancer adverse effects from both acute and chronic inhalation and \ndermal exposures to methylene chloride, and cancer from chronic \ninhalation and dermal exposures to methylene chloride (Refs. 10, 13). \nTo address the unreasonable risks, the 2023 proposed rule (Ref. 10) \nsought to prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution in \ncommerce of methylene chloride for consumer use; require a workplace \nchemical protection program (WCPP) for those industrial and commercial \nuses not proposed to be prohibited, which included a requirement to \nmeet inhalation exposure concentration limits for both an 8-hour time-\nweighted average and 15-minute time-weighted average exposures, and to \nconduct exposure monitoring for certain continued conditions of use of \nmethylene chloride; prohibit most industrial and commercial uses of \nmethylene chloride; require recordkeeping and downstream notification \nrequirements for several conditions of use of methylene chloride; and \nprovide certain time-limited exemptions from requirements for uses of \nmethylene chloride that would otherwise significantly disrupt national \nsecurity or critical infrastructure.\n    2. Summary of the comments received on the notice of proposed \nrulemaking. After publication of the 2023 proposed rule for methylene \nchloride (Ref. 10), EPA opened a public comment from May 3, 2023, to \nJuly 3, 2023. During this time, EPA received almost 40,000 public \ncomments, the vast majority of which were submitted by individuals \nparticipating in mass mailer campaigns requesting that EPA protect \nworkers and consumers expeditiously and to strengthen the proposed \nrequirements (Refs. 14, 15, 16, 17). Other commenters requested \nexpansion of the WCPP to include additional conditions of use or to \nallow all industrial and commercial conditions of use under the WCPP, \nadditional time for compliance with the WCPP (ranging from 6 months to \n5 years), additional exemptions under TSCA section 6(g), and a de \nminimis regulatory threshold (Refs. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, \n27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, \n45, 46). EPA also received specific information from various industry \nsectors requesting changes to the proposed rule, including information \nfrom laboratories that use methylene chloride. For a full discussion of \ncomments related to WCPP compliance timeframes, refer to Final Rule \nUnit III.D.1., and Response to Comments section 5.1.7 (Refs. 1, 47).\n    Comments were received by laboratory-affiliated organizations such \nas the American Council of Independent Laboratories (ACIL), Pace \nAnalytical, and the Environmental Monitoring Coalition (EMC) (Refs. 48, \n49, 50). While ACIL's comment expressed broad support of the 2023 \nproposed rule, their comment conveyed the concerns of its members \nregarding use of methylene chloride in environmental testing and \ncompliance required by EPA's analytical methods (Ref. 48). Similarly, \nEMC stated that the proposed rule could affect environmental compliance \nmonitoring, remediation of hazardous waste sites, and emergency \nresponses thereby impacting public health and the environment (Ref. \n50). ACIL suggested that for laboratories conducting environmental and \nfood safety testing using methylene chloride, potentially exposed \npersons should be protected through prescriptive controls such as \nventilation and dermal PPE instead of the WCPP (Ref. 48). Both ACIL's \nand EMC's comments, which were supported by Pace Analytical, requested \nthat EPA revise its analytical methods under other statutes prior to \nfinalizing the TSCA regulation and to grant the private sector and \nVoluntary Consensus Standard Bodies the opportunity to develop new \napproaches that reduce the amount of the solvent within a shorter \ntimeframe than EPA's process to develop new analytical methods (Refs. \n48, 49, 50). ACIL highlighted challenges and costs associated with \nmeeting the exposure monitoring compliance date, training requirements, \nvalidation of new methods, modification of equipment, and \nreaccreditation of the laboratories by third parties (Ref. 48). This \nissue is discussed further in Unit II.C.2.\n    Other commenters provided remarks on various aspects of the \nlaboratory condition of use and its coverage under the 2023 proposed \nrule's WCPP. An independent commenter expressed concern that the \napproach of laboratories under the WCPP was unreasonable because the \nscale of use is not analogous to industry (Ref. 51). The commenter also \nhighlighted that colleges and universities may contain numerous amounts \nof laboratories which would place an unacceptable burden on them to \ncomply with the proposed rule's WCPP. The American Chemical Society \n(ACS) iterated a similar concern for small scale use of methylene \nchloride in laboratories and exposure monitoring under the proposed \nWCPP (Ref. 52). Their comment cited concerns for the WCPP compliance \ncosts and costs of retaining safety professional services (Ref. 52). \nAdditionally, ACS stated that tracking personnel for the WCPP's \nrecordkeeping in an academic environment is impractical because the \nturnover rate among universities for students/faculty is high and \nrequested that EPA adopt a different approach (Ref. 52).\n\nB. The May 2024 Final Rule\n\n    On May 8, 2024, EPA published the final regulation for methylene \nchloride under TSCA section 6(a) (Ref. 1). Many of the provisions in \nthe 2023 proposed rule were finalized as proposed. EPA considered \ninformation received through public comments, making a number of \nrevisions to: include additional uses under the WCPP, broaden the scope \nof some WCPP uses to include those in the private sector in addition to \nthe Federal agencies, provide a delayed prohibition for two conditions \nof use, include a de minimis regulatory threshold, extend the \ncompliance dates for the WCPP and prohibition, and revise specific \nprovisions of the WCPP. For a complete description of these changes, \nsee Unit III. of the 2024 final regulation (Ref. 1). This Unit \nadditionally provides a summary of comments which compelled EPA to \nextend the compliance timeframes for the WCPP.\n    EPA originally proposed that the WCPP compliance activities begin \nwith initial monitoring to be completed at six months. However, after \nconsidering information received from commenters, EPA finalized the \nWCPP compliance activities to begin at 12 months for general industry \nusers and at 30 months for Federal agencies and their contractors from \nthe date of publication of the final rule, by which time regulated \nentities would be required to complete their initial monitoring. This \nrevision to the compliance timeframe resulted from public commenters, \nsuch as those described in the previous paragraphs, who stated that the \nproposed compliance timeframes for the WCPP were inadequate to \nimplement for several reasons including: challenges associated with the \nimplementation of recordkeeping for the hierarchy of controls; that the \nproposed rule did not account for the increased demand of professional \nsafety services; and because\n\n[[Page 22217]]\n\ndevelopment of an exposure assessment strategy would require additional \ntime (Refs. 33, 34, 36, 53, 54). During the public comment period, \ncommenters submitted concerns that the Good Laboratory Practice \nstandards were atypical within the industrial hygiene community to use \nfor air monitoring samples (Refs. 25, 34, 36, 44). Based on these \ncomments, in addition to revising the compliance timeframes after \nconsideration of public comments, the Agency revised its approach to \nexpand the analysis of monitoring results and associated recordkeeping \nrequirements to any accredited lab including GLP, AIHA (Laboratory \nAccreditation Program), and analogous industry-recognized programs.\n    The 2024 methylene chloride final rule's WCPP, with revisions \nprompted by public commenters, includes and finalizes exposure limits; \ninitial, periodic, and additional exposure monitoring requirements; \nregulated areas; PPE and respirator requirements; an exposure control \nplan; recordkeeping; and notification requirements (Ref. 1).\n\nC. Impacts of the 2024 Final Rule on Laboratories\n\n    As discussed in Unit II.A. and B., EPA's final regulation of \nmethylene chloride addresses unreasonable risk of injury to human \nhealth presented by all known, intended and reasonably foreseen uses of \nmethylene chloride. Since the publication of the final rule, EPA has \nreceived many inquiries requesting clarification with respect to that \nfinal rule, but a majority of those inquiries came from laboratories, \nand some inquirers provided new information or additional context to \nthe challenges specific to laboratories with implementation of the \nWCPP. That information is summarized in more detail in this Unit.\n    1. The utility of methylene chloride as a laboratory solvent. EPA \nrecognizes that methylene chloride has numerous uses in \npharmaceuticals, research and development, academia, and environmental \nmonitoring and compliance laboratories. It is a common laboratory \nsolvent due to its polarity, low boiling point, and inability to act as \na proton donor in a reaction, making it suitable for various \napplications like liquid chromatography, extractions, synthesis, and \npurification. Its volume of use is often low and may vary from \nlaboratory to laboratory. In environmental testing and compliance \nlaboratories, methylene chloride is an analyte that is required to be \nmonitored. For these types of laboratories, environmental testing is \nconducted in situations where contaminant level requirements exist \nunder certain environmental statutes. Methylene chloride is also used \nin sample preparation before an analysis of persistent organic \npollutants (Ref. 55).\n    2. Use of methylene chloride in analyses of environmental \nmonitoring samples. Although a few commenters on the 2023 proposal \n(Ref. 10) noted that laboratories performing sample analysis for \nenvironmental monitoring and environmental compliance purposes would be \naffected by the rule (Refs. 48, 49, 50), after the final rule was \nissued in May 2024 (Ref. 1), EPA began receiving more information on \nthe number of laboratories involved in environmental monitoring and \nenvironmental compliance testing, the variety of EPA-approved and \nmandatory methods that require the use of methylene chloride as a \nsolvent, and the equipment and procedures used by these laboratories \nthat ensure that worker exposures are low. According to the ACIL, their \nmembers perform more than 3 million tests annually using methylene \nchloride, many of which are performed pursuant to regulatory \nrequirements of other statutes and use more than 50 EPA-approved \nmethods or voluntary consensus standards that mandate the use of \nmethylene chloride as a solvent (Refs. 48, 56). In addition to the \npreviously-mentioned Method 0010 (Ref. 9), used to test the efficiency \nof incineration systems or determine particulate emission rates, other \nhazardous waste test methods (known as SW-846 methods) that require the \nuse of methylene chloride include Method 3511, Organic Compounds in \nWater by Microextraction, and Method 3535A, Solid-Phase Extraction, \nwhich is used to isolate target organic analytes from aqueous samples \n(Ref. 9). EPA's National Primary Drinking Water Regulations at 40 CFR \npart 141 require methods that use methylene chloride, including Method \n506, used to detect phthalate and adipate esters in drinking water, and \nMethod 525.2, used to detect organic compounds in drinking water (Ref. \n57). EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System regulations \nunder the Clean Water Act also require, at 40 CFR part 136, methods \nthat use methylene chloride, including Method 608 for organochlorine \npesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls, Method 612 for chlorinated \nhydrocarbons, and Method 613 for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin \n(Refs. 9, 58, 59, 60). The Clean Air Act also requires under its \nregulations methods that use methylene chloride, including, under 40 \nCFR part 60, Method 23A, the Determination of Polychlorinated Dibenzo-\np-Dioxins, Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, \nand Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Stationary Sources (Ref. 61).\n    Many analytical methods that must be used for environmental testing \ninvolve the use of methylene chloride. Unlike other affected entities, \nenvironmental testing laboratories are currently unable to select an \nalternative analytical method that does not require the use of \nmethylene chloride due to requirements to use certain analytical \nmethods. As such, these laboratories are not afforded the same ability \nor flexibility to eliminate the use of methylene chloride or substitute \nalternative solvent chemicals as other industries are able to do under \nthe same rule. Many of these analytical methods do not list alternative \nchemicals that may be used in place of methylene chloride in the \nanalytical method, and the process to revise or develop new analytical \nmethods using different chemicals is a multi-year process that would \nexceed the WCPP compliance dates (Ref. 48). EPA now recognizes that the \nspecification for the use of methylene chloride in analytical methods \nlimits the ability of laboratories to exercise certain exposure control \nmethods under the WCPP's Exposure Control Plan, including elimination \nand substitution, prior to implementing PPE and/or respirators.\n    According to a commenter, laboratories analyzing environmental \nsamples for monitoring and compliance purposes explained that their use \nof methylene chloride typically occurs in areas with high-level \nventilation and in a fume hood (Ref. 48). This practice is intended to \nprotect workers from exposure to methylene chloride and prevents \ncontamination of laboratory surfaces and the air by methylene chloride \nthat could compromise the analysis of the samples (Ref. 48). The \nAmerican Council of Independent Laboratories noted that, in order to \nensure that such contamination is not occurring, their laboratories \nroutinely test blank samples for contamination (Ref. 48). They further \nnoted that laboratory accreditation organizations ensure that \naccredited laboratories are monitoring processes for potential \ncontamination on a regular basis (Ref. 48). Thus, ACIL concludes that, \nif exposure to high levels of methylene chloride was occurring, their \nroutine testing for sample contamination would likely flag such \nproblems (Ref. 48). After EPA promulgated the May 2024 final rule, ACIL \nreferred to statements\n\n[[Page 22218]]\n\npresented in the Response to Comments document and in a public webinar \nthat the Agency's data and rationale supported the use of fume hoods as \nan exposure control to protect laboratory personnel (Refs. 47, 56, 62). \nAs EPA stated in the Response to Public Comments and the public \nwebinar, the Agency maintains high confidence in laboratories' ability \nto achieve the protective measures needed to address the unreasonable \nrisk and to meet the requirements of the WCPP and ECEL (Refs. 47, 62).\n    During the proposed rule's public comment period, one of the main \nconcerns voiced by environmental monitoring laboratories was the cost \nand difficulty of performing initial monitoring, and, potentially, \nperiodic monitoring (Refs. 48, 49, 50). Due to compliance costs as a \nresult of the final regulation, ACIL stated that smaller laboratories \nserving rural communities may cease environmental analyses that require \nthe use of methylene chloride-based methods (Ref. 56). According to \nother laboratories, most have not had to perform exposure monitoring \nunder the OSHA Methylene Chloride Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1052, because \nthey are complying with the OSHA Laboratory Standard at 29 CFR \n1910.1450, and monitoring is not required unless there is reason to \nbelieve that exposure levels routinely exceed the applicable OSHA \naction level, which for methylene chloride is 12.5 ppm (Refs. 52, 63, \n64, 65). In their view, compliance with the containment requirements of \nthe Laboratory Standard at 29 CFR 1910.1450, such as proper use of fume \nhoods or glove boxes, precludes ambient methylene chloride levels that \nexceed the TSCA action level, as well as the OSHA action level (Refs. \n52, 63, 64, 65). These commenters did not provide monitoring data in \nsupport of their views, and while EPA agrees that proper use of fume \nhoods or glove boxes would likely be sufficient to address unreasonable \nrisks from methylene chloride, without monitoring information to \ndemonstrate as such, any laboratory could not be considered to be in \ncompliance with the WCPP.\n    Some organizations indicated a desire to undertake an arduous and \npotentially costly process to revise existing analytical method \nrequirements rather than monitoring to demonstrate compliance with the \nECEL, which, as noted above, could likely be met with use of laboratory \nhoods. Two organizations expressed that the better approach would be \nfor EPA to work with the FDA, States, and standards-setting \norganizations to revise mandatory analytical methods to not require the \nuse of methylene chloride, although they recognized that this would \ntake a significant amount of time, and is outside the scope of a 6(a) \nTSCA rulemaking. One mentioned the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons \n(CFCs) as an example, and stated that EPA took 20 years to conduct the \nneeded research and to make the needed regulatory changes to remove the \nrequirement to employ CFCs as solvents in its required oil and grease \nmethods. They further noted that the use of methylene chloride is \nspecified in many more methods than CFCs were. EPA understands the \nappeal of this approach, which would result in the elimination of \nmethylene chloride hazards in many laboratories. However, EPA has \ndetermined that methylene chloride can be safely used in laboratories \noperating under the WCPP, so there is no need to terminate use of an \neffective solvent.\n    3. Use of methylene chloride in other laboratories. After EPA \npromulgated the final rule in 2024, representatives of academic \nlaboratories also began contacting the Agency about the rule's impacts. \nEPA heard from individual universities, such as the University of \nCalifornia and Purdue University, as well as from the College Safety \nHealth Environmental Management Association (CSHEMA) and the American \nChemical Society, speaking on behalf of academic teaching and research \nlaboratories. These stakeholders explained additional challenges that \nacademic laboratories face in complying with the final rule. \nUniversities often have multiple campuses, with a variety of \nlaboratories on each, and methylene chloride is typically used only \ninfrequently in most of these laboratories. In their view, it would be \ncost prohibitive to perform initial monitoring, and periodic monitoring \nif necessary, in each laboratory that they control, particularly where \nit is unlikely that anyone may be routinely exposed to methylene \nchloride (Ref. 48). In addition, because EPA's final rule extends \nprotections beyond workers to all potentially exposed persons in the \narea, students will be covered by the rule and will potentially have to \nbe provided with training, medically qualified to don a respirator, \nfit-tested for respirator use, and issued PPE and respirators, and \nrecords would have to be kept accordingly.\n    Law enforcement agencies and laboratories also shared information \nwith EPA after promulgation of the final rule. The Texas Department of \nPublic Safety, New York City Police Department, the Johnson County (KS) \nSheriff's Office, and the Wyoming State Crime Laboratory described the \nuse of methylene chloride in small quantities for testing purposes, \nsuch as testing for controlled substances, like cocaine and heroin \n(Refs. 66, 67, 68, 69). These labs requested clarity on how the \nrulemaking would apply to their use, including if EPA was aware of \nalternatives to methylene chloride for testing of controlled substances \nand asking if methylene chloride use could continue with an exposure \ncontrol plan in place.\n\nIII. Provisions of This Proposed Rule\n\nA. Establishing Compliance Dates\n\n    TSCA section 6(d) includes a number of provisions relating to \nestablishment of effective or compliance dates applicable to TSCA \nsection 6 rules. TSCA section 6(d)(1)(A) directs EPA to specify a date \non which the TSCA section 6(a) rule is to take effect that is ``as soon \nas practicable,'' while TSCA section 6(d)(1)(B) requires EPA to specify \nmandatory compliance dates for each requirement of a rule promulgated \nunder TSCA section 6(a), which must be as soon as practicable but no \nlater than five years after promulgation, with few exceptions.\n    EPA's 2023 NPRM would have required entities subject to the WCPP to \nconduct initial exposure monitoring no later than six months after the \nfinal rule was published, establish regulated areas and provide \npersonal protective equipment (PPE) within the next three months, and \ndevelop and implement an exposure control plan three months after that, \nor within one year of the publication of the final rule. Many industry \ncommenters thought that the compliance dates for WCPP implementation \nwere too ambitious, while environmental advocacy organizations thought \nthat industry should be required to comply sooner with worker \nprotection measures once monitoring data showing exceedances of the \nECEL or STEL was obtained. Industry commenters cited concerns about the \navailability of industrial hygiene personnel and monitoring methods, as \nwell as the time it would take to implement engineering and \nadministrative controls in the workplace.\n    In balancing questions over the practicability of WCPP compliance \ndates with the interest in protecting workers from unreasonable risks, \nEPA determined that the proposed timeframe was not practicable for all \nwho would need to comply with it. Therefore, the final rule provided an \nadditional six months of time for all owners and operators to implement \nthe WCPP. Federal agencies and their contractors have approximately 18 \nadditional months to comply with the WCPP,\n\n[[Page 22219]]\n\nbased on EPA's concern about the ability of certain departments and \nagencies of the Federal Government to achieve compliance with the \nprivate-sector timeframes and given the importance of methylene \nchloride to mission-critical Department of Defense and National \nAeronautics and Space Administration operations and overall military \nreadiness. For more information on this issue, see Unit III.D.1 of the \n2024 final rule.\n\nB. Proposed Compliance Date Extension for the Industrial and Commercial \nUse of Methylene Chloride as a Laboratory Chemical\n\n    As a result of the information from laboratories and organizations \nrepresenting laboratories subsequent to the publication of the 2024 \nfinal rule, EPA is proposing to extend the compliance dates applicable \nto non-federal owners and operators that use methylene chloride as a \nlaboratory chemical, aligning with timeframes for Federal laboratories \nand Federal contractors. Under this proposal, such laboratories would \nhave until November 9, 2026 to conduct initial monitoring, until \nFebruary 8, 2027 to establish regulated areas and ensure compliance \nwith the ECEL and EPA STEL, and until May 10, 2027 to develop and \nimplement an exposure control plan. EPA has based this proposal on \nnumber of challenges to WCPP compliance identified by laboratories, \nincluding their inability to choose a different, less toxic solvent \nwhen performing analyses, especially environmental monitoring sample \nanalyses that must be performed in accordance with specified methods, \nand the availability and cost of industrial hygiene personnel to \nconduct initial monitoring. In EPA's view, the newly proposed \ncompliance dates are practicable and represent a reasonable transition \nperiod under TSCA section 6(d). Moreover, using compliance dates \nalready established for Federal agencies and their contractors avoids \nthe confusion that EPA may have created by having multiple compliance \ndates for various WCPP provisions.\n    EPA requests comments and specific information addressing:\n    <bullet> The ability of the various laboratories to comply with the \nrequirements of the WCPP by the newly proposed compliance dates.\n    <bullet> Alternative compliance timeframes for laboratories that \nrepresent dates that are as soon as practicable and provide for a \nreasonable transition period.\n    <bullet> Information related to laboratory use of methylene \nchloride, addressing risks associated with that use, that may not have \nbeen previously available to EPA during risk management and should now \nbe considered.\n    <bullet> The costs of compliance with the WCPP for laboratories, \nsuch as the cost of: obtaining the services of an industrial hygienist, \nidentifying relevant tasks associated with methylene chloride exposure, \ncollecting and analyzing exposure samples, including the cost of \nequipment necessary to collect exposure samples, training, \nrecordkeeping, implementing engineering and administrative controls and \nPPE, and modifying existing chemical hygiene plans developed under 29 \nCFR 1910.1450 to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 751.109(e)(2).\n    <bullet> The cost differential of compliance between EPA \nrequirements (40 CFR 751.109) and the current OSHA laboratory standard \n(29 CFR 1910.1450).\n    <bullet> The number of potentially exposed persons who operate in \nvarious laboratories under the workplace chemical protection program \nrequirements and the costs and benefits.\n    EPA also welcomes comments, including data supporting alternative \napproaches to ensuring that potentially exposed persons are protected \nwhen they are working in, or otherwise present in, laboratories where \nmethylene chloride is being used. For example, several commenters on \nthe 2023 proposal took note of the approach taken in EPA's proposed \nTSCA section 6 rule on perchloroethylene (Ref. 48), which addressed \nlaboratory exposures to perchloroethylene by requiring fume hoods or \nother enclosures and dermal protection. EPA understands that much of \nthe methylene chloride use in laboratories is done under a fume hood or \nin glove boxes or other enclosures that limit air concentrations in the \nvicinity of the use. However, data in the methylene chloride risk \nevaluation indicates the potential for air concentrations in \nlaboratories to exceed the ECEL. EPA is interested in any information \nthat describes exposure reductions that fume hoods or other enclosures \ncurrently in use in laboratories provide that may reduce risks such \nthat they are no longer unreasonable.\n\nIV.

Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review and Executive \nOrder 13563: Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review\n\n    This action is not a significant regulatory action under Executive \nOrder 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and was therefore not \nsubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under \nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011).\n\nB. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation\n\n    This action is expected to be an Executive Order 14192 deregulatory \naction. This proposed rule is expected to provide burden reduction by \nproviding relief against existing compliance deadlines.\n\nC. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)\n\n    This action does not impose any new information collection \nactivities or burden subject to OMB review and approval under the PRA, \n44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. However, this action defers the costs associated \nwith paperwork and recordkeeping burden for an existing information \ncollection because the delayed compliance date alters the time horizon \nof the collection's analysis. Burden is defined in 5 CFR 1320.3(b). OMB \nhas previously approved the information collection activities contained \nin the existing regulations and associated burden under OMB Control No. \n2070-0229 (EPA ICR No. 2735.02). An agency may not conduct or sponsor, \nand a person is not required to respond to a collection of information \nthat requires OMB approval under PRA, unless it has been approved by \nOMB and displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control \nnumbers for EPA's regulations in title 40 of the CFR, after appearing \nin the Federal Register, are listed in 40 CFR part 9, and included on \nthe related collection instrument or form, if applicable.\n\n[[Page 22221]]\n\nD. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)\n\n    I certify that this action will not have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the RFA, 5 \nU.S.C. 601 et seq. In making this determination, EPA concludes that the \nimpact of concern for this action is any significant adverse economic \nimpact on small entities, and the Agency is certifying that this rule \nwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities because the rule relieves regulatory burden. This action \nwould extend the compliance dates for several provisions of the WCPP \nfor approximately 18 months for the industrial and commercial use of \nmethylene chloride as a laboratory chemical. We have therefore \nconcluded that this action would relieve regulatory burden for those \nentities engaged in the industrial and commercial use of methylene \nchloride as a laboratory chemical.\n\nE. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA)\n\n    This action does not contain an unfunded mandate as described in \nUMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538, and does not significantly or uniquely affect \nsmall governments. The action imposes no enforceable duty on any state, \nlocal or tribal governments or the private sector.\n\nF. Executive Order 13132: Federalism\n\n    This action does not have federalism implications as specified in \nExecutive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999) because it will \nnot have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship \nbetween the national government and the states, or on the distribution \nof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\n\nG. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian \nTribal Governments\n\n    This action does not have tribal implications as specified in \nExecutive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) because it does \nnot have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on \nthe relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian tribes. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not \napply to this action.\n\nH. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental \nHealth Risks and Safety Risks\n\n    This action is not a ``covered regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it is not an \neconomically significant regulatory action as defined by Executive \nOrder 12866.\n\nI. Executive Order 13211: Actions Concerning Regulations That \nSignificantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use\n\n    This action is not subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, \nMay 22, 2001) because it is not a significant regulatory action under \nExecutive Order 12866.\n\nJ. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA)\n\n    Pursuant to the NTTAA section 12(d), 15 U.S.C. 272, the Agency has \ndetermined that this proposed rulemaking involves environmental \nmonitoring or measurement, specifically for occupational inhalation \nexposures to methylene chloride. Consistent with the Agency's \nPerformance Based Measurement System (PBMS), EPA has decided not to \nrequire the use of specific, prescribed analytic methods. Rather, the \nAgency will allow the use of any method that meets the prescribed \nperformance criteria. The PBMS approach is intended to be more flexible \nand cost-effective for the regulated community; it is also intended to \nencourage innovation in analytical technology and improved data \nquality. EPA is not precluding the use of any method, whether it \nconstitutes a voluntary consensus standard or not, as long as it meets \nthe performance criteria specified.\n    For this proposed rulemaking, the key consideration for the PBMS \napproach is the ability to accurately detect and measure airborne \nconcentrations of methylene chloride at the ECEL, the ECEL action \nlevel, and the EPA STEL. Some examples of methods which meet the \ncriteria are included in appendix A of the ECEL memo (Ref. 71). EPA \nrecognizes that there may be voluntary consensus standards (Ref. 72).\n\nList of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 751\n\n    Environmental protection, Chemicals, Export notification, Hazardous \nsubstances, Import certification, Reporting and recordkeeping.\n\nLee Zeldin,\nAdministrator.\n\n    For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the EPA proposes to \namend 40 CFR part 751 as follows:\n\nPART 751--REGULATION OF CERTAIN CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES AND MIXTURES \nUNDER SECTION 6 OF THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 751 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 15 U.S.C. 2605, 15 U.S.C. 2625(l)(4).\n\n0\n2. Amend Sec.  751.109 by revising paragraphs (c), (d)(2), (e), (f), \nand (g) to read as follows:\n\n\nSec.  751.109  Workplace Chemical Protection Program.\n\n* * * * *\n    (c) Exposure limits--(1) ECEL.

Two DPSs are listed as endangered, and two DPSs are listed as \nthreatened. On January 14, 2025, after obtaining required information \nto complete our analysis for determining critical habitat, we published \na proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the four DPSs (90 FR \n3412). The proposed rule opened a 60-day comment period, which ended \nMarch 17, 2025.\n    As a result of a public request and to give all interested parties \nan additional opportunity to comment on the proposed rule, we are \nreopening the comment period for the proposed rule to designate \ncritical habitat for the four DPSs of the foothill yellow-legged frog \ndescribed above for an additional 60-day period.\n    Please refer to the proposed rule to designate critical habitat for \nmore information on our proposed action and the specific information we \nseek. Additional information about the proposed rule, including \nsupplementary materials and the comments received, is available on the \ninternet at <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a> at Docket No. FWS-R8-ES-2023-\n0157.\n    We request that you send comments only by the methods described \nabove in ADDRESSES. We will post all comments on <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>. This generally means that we will post any \npersonal information you provide us (see Public Comments, below, for \nmore information).\n\nPublic Comments\n\n    If you already submitted comments or information on the January 14, \n2025, proposed rule (90 FR 3412), please do not resubmit them. Any such \ncomments are incorporated as part of the public record of the \nrulemaking proceeding, and we will fully consider them in the \npreparation of our final determination.\n    Comments should be as specific as possible. Please include any \nsupplemental information with your submission (such as scientific \njournal articles or other publications) to allow us to verify any \nscientific information you include. Please note that submissions merely \nstating support for, or opposition to, the action under consideration \nwithout providing supporting information, although noted, do not \nprovide substantial information necessary to support a determination, \nas section 4(b)(2) of the Act directs that the Secretary shall \ndesignate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data \navailable.\n    You may submit your comments and materials by one of the methods \nlisted in ADDRESSES. We request that you send comments only by the \nmethods described in ADDRESSES.

The Conference studies the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness \nof the administrative procedures used by Federal agencies and makes \nrecommendations to agencies, the President, Congress, and the Judicial \nConference of the United States for procedural improvements (5 U.S.C. \n594(1)). For further information about the Conference and its \nactivities, see <a href=\"http://www.acus.gov\">www.acus.gov</a>.\n\nFederal Agency Collaboration With State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial \nGovernments\n\n    State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments (SLTTGs) play a \ncritical role in administering many Federal programs. Approximately 81 \npercent of Federal statutes include provisions that contemplate some \nkind of collaboration--formal or informal--between Federal agencies and \nSLTTGs. When governments collaborate, they work together to produce \nmore public value than they could produce on their own, promoting \ngreater accountability, transparency, and innovation in the \nadministration of Federal programs.\n    Such intergovernmental partnerships are critical for administering \na wide array of Federal policies in myriad contexts.\\1\\ For example, \nthe Army collaborates with State and local environmental agencies when \nconstructing water navigation projects.\\2\\ Under the Affordable Care \nAct, States are responsible for implementing certain insurance-exchange \nprovisions which the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \noversees.\\3\\ In the law enforcement context, HHS and the Department of \nJustice are responsible for coordinating Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement programs to control fraud and abuse with respect to health \nplans,\\4\\ while the Drug Enforcement Administration pursues its \nenforcement efforts under the Controlled Substances Act with the help \nof State and local task forces.\\5\\ The Federal Highway Administration \nand Bureau of Indian Affairs work in partnership with Tribal \ngovernments to facilitate Tribal transportation planning on Tribal \nlands.\\6\\ Finally, the Department of Homeland Security oversees a \nNational Network of Fusion Centers, in coordination with SLTTGs and \nother Federal partners, to facilitate threat-related information \nsharing among such entities.\\7\\ These are just some examples of the \nmany ways in which Federal agencies and SLTTGs partner to more \neffectively and efficiently deliver public services.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Pamela J.

However, there is limited \nresearch on how Federal agencies and SLTTGs work together to achieve \nsuccessful partnerships. Through this project, ACUS is seeking to learn \nmore about the laws and policies that govern and shape \nintergovernmental partnerships; the frequency and scale of Federal \ncollaboration with SLTTGs; practical considerations that policymakers \nevaluate in structuring, implementing, and maintaining such \npartnerships; and challenges that administrators face in managing them. \nThe project will result in a set of recommended best practices that \nFederal agencies can use to coordinate and collaborate more effectively \nwith SLTTG partners.\n\n[[Page 22225]]\n\nSpecific Topics for Public Comment\n\n    ACUS welcomes views, information, and data on all aspects of \nstrategies and approaches that agencies are using or might use to \ncollaborate with State, local, Tribal, and/or territorial governments \nin administering Federal programs. ACUS also seeks specific feedback on \nthe following questions related to agencies' collaboration efforts:\n    1. What has been your experience regarding collaboration with a \nFederal agency to carry out a program?\n    2. If you have been involved in an intergovernmental partnership, \nwho are (or were) your intergovernmental partners?\n    3. In your experience, what makes a collaboration successful? Are \nthere practices that Federal and SLTTG officials could adopt to \nfacilitate more productive collaborations?\n    4. In your experience, what challenges do Federal officials \nexperience when interacting with SLTTG partners? What strategies have \nFederal and SLTTG officials used (or do use) to address these \nchallenges? Were any strategies particularly effective or ineffective? \nWhy or why not? Are there any lessons learned, policies, or practices \nthat could be implemented to enhance intergovernmental partnerships?\n    5. In your experience, how do (or did) intergovernmental partners \ncommunicate with each other and with other interested persons? Has \ntechnology changed this dynamic, and, if so, how?\n    6. In your experience, to what extent do Federal agencies and SLTTG \npartners develop policies that govern their relationships? To what \nextent are such policies made publicly available?\n    7. To what extent are Federal officials and SLTTG partners aware of \nthe laws governing their collaboration?\n\n    Dated: May 20, 2025.\nShawne McGibbon,\nGeneral Counsel.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09373 Filed 5-23-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6110-01-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

The Animal \nand Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) considers CWR a quarantine \npest. Under international standards, a quarantine pest is defined as \n``a pest of potential economic importance to the area endangered by it \nand not yet present there, or present but not widely distributed there \nand being officially controlled.'' \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. \n5, ``Glossary of Phytosanitary Terms'' found at <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/mc891e/mc891e.pdf\">https://www.fao.org/3/mc891e/mc891e.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Because CWR is considered a quarantine pest, APHIS' policy \\2\\ has \nprovided that any CWR detection domestically triggers an eradication \nprotocol requiring complete destruction of symptomatic plants and those \nnearby. The policy also has required fungicidal treatments be applied \nto asymptomatic plants. Affected growers or entities have borne the \neradication expense for CWR.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ See <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/cwr/downloads/cwrplan.pdf\">https://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/cwr/downloads/cwrplan.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    APHIS has also placed regulatory restrictions and prohibitions on \nthe importation of host material for CWR to prevent its introduction \ninto the United States through such importation. The regulations in 7 \nCFR 319.37-1 through 319.37-23 govern the importation of plants for \nplanting into the United States. Section 319.37-4 of the regulations \nprovides that certain taxa of plants for planting are not authorized \nfor importation into the United States pending pest risk analysis \n(NAPPRA) to prevent the introduction of quarantine pests into the \nUnited States.\n    Accordingly, unrooted cuttings and in vitro plantlets of \nChrysanthemum spp., Leucanthemella serotina, and Nipponanthemum \nnipponicum and synonymous taxa (Dendranthema spp.,) from Belgium, \nBolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Germany, \nGuatemala, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Spain, \nTanzania, Tunisia, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam have been \nNAPPRA or required post entry quarantine and additional entry \nrequirements. These restrictions are in place due to the risk that such \nimportation may pose of introducing CWR. Additionally, unrooted \ncuttings, in vitro plantlets, and plants with roots of the same taxa \nfrom Canada have had\n\n[[Page 22226]]\n\nadditional entry requirements due to CWR.\n    Paragraph (e) of Sec.  319.37-4 describes the process for removing \ntaxa from the NAPPRA list. After receiving a request to remove taxa \nfrom the NAPPRA list, APHIS will conduct a pest risk analysis in \nresponse to such a request and make the pest risk analysis available \nfor public review and comment. Following the close of the comment \nperiod, we will review all comments received and announce our decision \nregarding the request in a subsequent notice.\n    In accordance with that process, on April 17, 2023, we published in \nthe Federal Register (88 FR 23390-23391, Docket No. APHIS-2021-0081) a \nnotice \\3\\ of availability in which we announced the availability, for \nreview and comment, of a pest risk analysis that evaluated the risks \nassociated with the importation of unrooted cuttings and in vitro \nplantlets of Chrysanthemum spp. and synonymous genera under a systems \napproach from Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El \nSalvador, Ethiopia, Germany, Guatemala, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, \nNicaragua, Panama, Spain, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda, the United \nKingdom, and Vietnam into the continental United States. We also made \navailable a pest list and commodity import evaluation document (CIED) \nregarding the importation of unrooted cuttings, in vitro plantlets, and \nplants with roots of the same Chrysanthemum spp. and synonymous genera \nfrom Canada under a separate protocol. Additionally, we made available \nto the public an economic evaluation (EE) relative to deregulating CWR \nfungus as a quarantine pest. Related to this notice and based on the \nrecommendations of APHIS' EE, we proposed to change APHIS' policy so \nthat CWR would no longer be considered of quarantine significance if \ndetected domestically or on imported plants for planting.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ To view the notice and the supporting documents, go to \n<a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>. Enter APHIS-2021-0081 in the Search field.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    We solicited comments on the notice for 60 days, ending on June 16, \n2023. We received 13 comments by that date. They were from businesses, \nindustry trade groups, and government agencies.\n    Several commenters noted that we did not delineate ``synonymous \ngenera'' in the initial notice and asked us what taxa were intended to \nbe included by that term.\n    In consideration of the validity of these questions and after \ncareful review, APHIS is modifying and updating the pest lists to \nclarify and refine references to regulatory taxa, consolidating into \nthe pest list a separate pest list for Canada, and revising the CIED. \nWe are also updating the list of affected nations and genera referenced \nin these documents to ensure all descriptions are clear and accurate in \nalignment with Sec.  319.37-4 (which provides that certain taxa of \nplants for planting are not authorized for importation into the United \nStates pending pest risk analysis); the USDA Agricultural Research \nService's Germplasm Resource Information Network (GRIN) taxonomic data; \nthe APHIS Plants for Planting Manual; and the Agricultural Commodity \nImport Requirements (ACIR) database.\n    We are reopening the comment period on Docket No. APHIS-2021-0081 \nfor an additional 30 days. This action will allow interested persons \ntime to review the updates and revisions to the pest risk analysis and \nto submit comments. The documents may be viewed on the Regulations.gov \nwebsite or in our reading room (see ADDRESSES above for a link to \nRegulations.gov and information on the location and hours of the \nreading room). You may request paper copies of these documents by \ncalling or writing to the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION \nCONTACT. Please refer to the subject of the analysis you wish to review \nwhen requesting copies.\n    We will also consider all comments received between June 17, 2023 \n(the day after the close of the original comment period) and the date \nof this notice.\n\n    Done in Washington, DC, this 20th day of May 2025.\nMichael Watson,\nAdministrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09443 Filed 5-23-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 3410-34-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

The WTO is the successor organization \nto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). United States \nmembership in the WTO was approved and the Uruguay Round Agreements Act \n(Uruguay Round Agreements) was signed into law by the President on \nDecember 8, 1994, Public Law 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809. The Uruguay Round \nAgreements became effective with respect to the United States on \nJanuary 1, 1995. The Uruguay Round Agreements amended the Trade \nAgreements Act of 1979. Pursuant to section 491 of the Trade Agreements \nAct of 1979, as amended, the President is required to designate an \nagency to be ``responsible for informing the public of the sanitary and \nphytosanitary (SPS) standard-setting activities of each international \nstandard-setting organization'' (19 U.S.C. 2578). The main \ninternational standard-setting organizations are the Codex Alimentarius \n(Codex), the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, founded as \nOIE), and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). The \nPresident, pursuant to Proclamation No. 6780 of March 23, 1995, (60 FR \n15845), designated the U.S. Department of Agriculture as the agency \nresponsible for informing the public of the SPS standard-setting \nactivities of each international standard-setting organization. The \nSecretary of Agriculture has delegated to the Trade and Foreign \nAgricultural Affairs Mission Area the responsibility to inform the \npublic of the SPS standard-setting activities of Codex. The Trade and \nForeign Agricultural Affairs Mission Area has, in turn, assigned the \nresponsibility for informing the public of the SPS standard-setting \nactivities of Codex to the U.S. Codex Office (USCO).\n    Codex was created in 1963. Codex is the principal international \norganization for establishing standards for food. Through adoption of \nfood standards, codes of practice, and other guidelines developed by \nits committees, and by promoting their adoption and implementation by \ngovernments, Codex seeks to protect the health of consumers, ensure \nfair practices in the food trade, and promote coordination of food \nstandards work undertaken by international governmental and non-\ngovernmental organizations. In the United States, U.S. Codex activities \nare managed and carried out by the United States Department of \nAgriculture (USDA); the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department \nof Health and Human Services (HHS); the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC); and \nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n    As the agency responsible for informing the public of the SPS \nstandard-setting activities of Codex, the USCO publishes this notice in \nthe Federal Register annually. Attachment 1: Sanitary and Phytosanitary \nActivities of Codex sets forth the following information:\n    1. The SPS standards under consideration or planned for \nconsideration; and\n    2. For each SPS standard specified:\n    a. A description of the consideration or planned consideration of \nthe standard;\n    b. Whether the United States is participating or plans to \nparticipate in the consideration of the standard;\n    c. The agenda for United States participation, if any; and\n    d. The agency responsible for representing the United States with \nrespect to the standard.\n    To obtain copies of the standards listed in Attachment 1: Sanitary \nand Phytosanitary Activities of Codex, please contact the U.S. delegate \nor the U.S. Codex Office.\n    This notice also solicits public comment on standards that are \ncurrently under consideration or planned for consideration and \nrecommendations for new standards. The U.S. delegate, in conjunction \nwith the responsible agency, will take the comments received into \naccount in participating in the consideration of the standards and in \nproposing matters to be considered by Codex.\n    The U.S. delegate will facilitate public participation in the \nUnited States Government's activities relating to Codex. The U.S. \ndelegate will maintain a list of individuals, groups, and organizations \nthat have expressed an interest in the activities of the Codex \ncommittees and will disseminate information regarding U.S. delegation \nactivities to interested parties. This information will include the \nstatus of each agenda item; the U.S. Government's position or \npreliminary position on each agenda item; and the time and place of \nplanning meetings and debriefing meetings following the Codex committee \nsessions. In addition, the USCO makes much of the same information \navailable through its web page at <a href=\"http://www.usda.gov/codex\">http://www.usda.gov/codex</a>.

telephone: (202) 482-0410 and (202) 482-7421, \nrespectively.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\n    On April 7, 2025, Commerce published its affirmative final \ndeterminations in the countervailing duty investigations of 2,4-D from \nChina and India.\\1\\ On May 16, 2025, the ITC notified Commerce of its \nfinal determinations, pursuant to section 705(d) of the Tariff Act of \n1930, as amended (the Act), that an industry in the United States is \nmaterially injured within the meaning of section\n\n[[Page 22233]]\n\n705(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act by reason of imports of 2,4-D from China and \nIndia.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid from India: Final \nAffirmative Countervailing Duty Determination, 90 FR 14961 (April 7, \n2025); and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid from the People's Republic \nof China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination, 90 FR \n14957 (April 7, 2025) (collectively, Final Determinations).\n    \\2\\ See ITC's Letter, ``Investigation Nos. 701-TA-710-711 and \n731-TA-1673-1674 (Final),'' dated May 16, 2025 (ITC Notification \nLetter).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCountervailing Duty Orders\n\n    Based on the final affirmative determinations by the ITC that an \nindustry in the United States is materially injured by reason of \nsubsidized imports of 2,4-D from China and India,\\3\\ in accordance with \nsection 705(c)(2) of the Act, Commerce is issuing these CVD orders. \nBecause the ITC determined that imports of 2,4-D from China and India \nare materially injuring a U.S. industry, unliquidated entries of such \nmerchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, are \nsubject to the assessment of countervailing duties.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Therefore, in accordance with section 706(a) of the Act, Commerce \nwill direct CBP to assess, upon further instructions by Commerce, \ncountervailing duties on unliquidated entries of 2,4-D from China and \nIndia entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after \nSeptember 13, 2024, the date of publication of the Preliminary \nDeterminations,\\4\\ but will not include entries occurring after the \nexpiration of the provisional measures period and before the \npublication of the ITC's final injury determination under section \n705(b) of the Act, as further described below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid from India: Preliminary \nAffirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Alignment of Final \nDetermination With Final Antidumping Duty Determination, 89 FR 74906 \n(September 13, 2024), and accompanying Preliminary Decision \nMemorandum (PDM);

These instructions suspending liquidation will remain in effect \nuntil further notice.\n    Commerce also intends, pursuant to section 706(a)(1) of the Act, to \ninstruct CBP to require cash deposits equal to the amounts as indicated \nbelow. Accordingly, effective on the date of publication of the ITC's \nfinal affirmative injury determination in the Federal Register, CBP \nwill require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit \nestimated customs duties on the subject merchandise, a cash deposit for \neach entry of subject merchandise equal to the subsidy rates listed \nbelow.\\5\\ The all-others rates apply to all producers or exporters not \nspecifically listed below, as appropriate.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See section 706(a)(3) of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScope of the Orders\n\n    The product covered by these orders is 2,4-D from China and India. \nFor a complete description of the scope of these orders, see the \nappendix to this notice.\n\nEstimated Countervailable Subsidy Rates\n\n    The estimated countervailable subsidy rates are as follows:\n\nChina\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ Commerce continues to find Tianyu to be cross-owned with the \nfollowing companies: Thai Harvest Ltd., CAC Nantong Chemical Co., \nLtd., and CAC Shanghai International Trading Co., Ltd.\n    \\7\\ Commerce continues to find Rainbow Agrosciences to be cross-\nowned with the following companies: Shandong Weifang Rainbow \nChemical Co., Ltd., Ningxia Rainbow Chemical Co., Ltd., Shandong \nRainbow Investment Co., Ltd., and Shandong Runnong Investment Co., \nLtd.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Subsidy rate (percent\n                    Company                            ad valorem)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJiangxi Tianyu Chemical Co., Ltd.\\6\\...........                    26.50\nShandong Rainbow Agrosciences Co., Ltd.\\7\\.....                 * 169.63\nAll Others.....................................                    26.50\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Rate based on facts available with adverse inferences.\n\nIndia\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ As discussed in the PDM, Commerce has found the following \ncompanies to be cross-owned with Meghmani Organics Limited: Epigral \nLimited; and Matangi Industries LLP.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Subsidy rate (percent\n                    Company                            ad valorem)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAtul Limited...................................                     5.29\nMeghmani Organics Limited \\8\\..................                     6.32\nAll Others.....................................                     5.88\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProvisional Measures\n\n    Section 703(d) of the Act states that the suspension of liquidation \npursuant to an affirmative preliminary determination may not remain in \neffect for more than four months. In the underlying investigations, \nCommerce published the Preliminary Determinations on September 13, \n2024.\\9\\ As such, the four-month period beginning on the date of the \npublication of the Preliminary Determinations ended on January 10, \n2025. Therefore, entries of 2,4-D from China and India made on or after \nJanuary 11, 2025, and prior to the date of publication of the ITC's \nfinal determinations in the Federal Register, are not subject to the \nassessment of countervailing duties due to Commerce's discontinuation \nof the suspension of liquidation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ See Preliminary Determinations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In accordance with section 703(d) of the Act, Commerce instructed \nCBP to terminate the suspension of liquidation and to liquidate, \nwithout regard to countervailing duties, unliquidated entries of 2,4-D \nfrom China and India entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for \nconsumption, on or after January 11,\n\n[[Page 22234]]\n\n2025, the date on which the provisional CVD measures expired, through \nthe day preceding the date of publication of the ITC final injury \ndeterminations in the Federal Register. Suspension of liquidation and \nthe collection of cash deposits will resume on the date of publication \nof the ITC final injury determinations in the Federal Register.\n\nEstablishment of the Annual Inquiry Service Lists\n\n    On September 20, 2021, Commerce published the final rule titled \n``Regulations to Improve Administration and Enforcement of Antidumping \nand Countervailing Duty Laws'' in the Federal Register.\\10\\ On \nSeptember 27, 2021, Commerce also published the notice titled ``Scope \nRuling Application; Annual Inquiry Service List; and Informational \nSessions'' in the Federal Register.\\11\\ The Final Rule and Procedural \nGuidance provide that Commerce will maintain an annual inquiry service \nlist for each order or suspended investigation, and any interested \nparty submitting a scope ruling application or request for \ncircumvention inquiry shall serve a copy of the application or request \non the persons on the annual inquiry service list for that order, as \nwell as any companion order covering the same merchandise from the same \ncountry of origin.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See Regulations to Improve Administration and Enforcement \nof Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Laws, 86 FR 52300 (September \n20, 2021) (Final Rule).\n    \\11\\ See Scope Ruling Application; Annual Inquiry Service List; \nand Informational Sessions, 86 FR 53205 (September 27, 2021) \n(Procedural Guidance).\n    \\12\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In accordance with the Procedural Guidance, for orders published in \nthe Federal Register after November 4, 2021, Commerce will create an \nannual inquiry service list segment in Commerce's online e-filing and \ndocument management system, Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \nElectronic Service System (ACCESS), available at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>, within five business days of publication of the \nnotice of the order. Each annual inquiry service list will be saved in \nACCESS, under each case number, and under a specific segment type \ncalled ``AISL--Annual Inquiry Service List.'' \\13\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ This segment will be combined with the ACCESS Segment \nSpecific Information (SSI) field which will display the month in \nwhich the notice of the order or suspended investigation was \npublished in the Federal Register, also known as the anniversary \nmonth. For example, for an order under case number A-000-000 that \nwas published in the Federal Register in January, the relevant \nsegment and SSI combination will appear in ACCESS as ``AISL--January \nAnniversary.'' Note that there will be only one annual inquiry \nservice list segment per case number, and the anniversary month will \nbe pre-populated in ACCESS.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested parties who wish to be added to the annual inquiry \nservice list for an order must submit an entry of appearance to the \nannual inquiry service list segment for the order in ACCESS within 30 \ndays after the date of publication of the order. For ease of \nadministration, Commerce requests that law firms with more than one \nattorney representing interested parties in an order designate a lead \nattorney to be included on the annual inquiry service list. Commerce \nwill finalize the annual inquiry service list within five business days \nthereafter. As mentioned in the Procedural Guidance, the new annual \ninquiry service list will be in place until the following year, when \nthe Opportunity Notice for the anniversary month of the order is \npublished.\n    Commerce may update an annual inquiry service list at any time as \nneeded based on interested parties' amendments to their entries of \nappearance to remove or otherwise modify their list of members and \nrepresentatives, or to update contact information. Any changes or \nannouncements pertaining to these procedures will be posted to the \nACCESS website at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>.\n\nSpecial Instructions for Petitioners and Foreign Governments\n\n    In the Final Rule, Commerce stated that, ``after an initial request \nand placement on the annual inquiry service list, both petitioners and \nforeign governments will automatically be placed on the annual inquiry \nservice list in the years that follow.'' \\14\\ Accordingly, as stated \nabove, the petitioners and foreign governments should submit their \ninitial entry of appearance after publication of this notice in order \nto appear in the first annual inquiry service list for those orders for \nwhich they qualify as an interested party.

In addition, Commerce is amending its final \ndetermination with respect to epoxy resins from Taiwan to correct a \nministerial error.\n\nDATES: Applicable May 27, 2025.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas Martin (Korea) at (202) 482-\n3936; and Ian Riggs (Taiwan) at (202) 482-3810; AD/CVD Operations, \nOffices IV and IX, respectively, Enforcement and Compliance, \nInternational Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1401 \nConstitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20230.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\n    In accordance with sections 705(d) and 777(i) of the Tariff Act of \n1930, as amended (the Act), on April 3, 2025, Commerce published its \naffirmative final determinations that countervailable subsidies are \nbeing provided to producers and exporters of epoxy resins from Korea \nand Taiwan.\\1\\ On April 9, 2025, the U.S. Epoxy Resin Producers Ad Hoc \nCoalition (the petitioner) timely alleged that Commerce made a \nministerial error in the Taiwan Final Determination.\\2\\ Section 705(e) \nof the Act and 19 CFR 351.224(f) define ministerial errors as errors in \naddition, subtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical errors \nresulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any \nother type of unintentional error which Commerce considers ministerial. \nWe reviewed the allegation and determined that we made a ministerial \nerror in the Taiwan Final Determination. See ``Amendment to the Taiwan \nFinal Determination'' section below for further discussion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See Certain Epoxy Resins from the Republic of Korea: Final \nAffirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Final Negative \nCritical Circumstances Determination, 90 FR 14605 (April 3, 2025) \n(Korea Final Determination); see also Certain Epoxy Resins from \nTaiwan: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination, 90 FR \n14618 (April 3, 2025) (Taiwan Final Determination).\n    \\2\\ See Petitioner's Letter, ``Ministerial Error Comments,'' \ndated April 9, 2025 (Petitioner's Ministerial Error Allegation).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On May 19, 2025, pursuant to section 705(d) of the Act, the ITC \nnotified Commerce of its final affirmative determinations that an \nindustry in the United States is materially injured by reason of \nsubsidized imports of epoxy resins from Korea and Taiwan, within the \nmeaning of section 705(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See ITC's Letter, ``Notification of ITC Final \nDetermination,'' dated May 19, 2025 (ITC Notification Letter).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScope of the Orders\n\n    The merchandise covered by these orders is epoxy resins from Korea \nand Taiwan. For a complete description of the scope of the orders, see \nthe appendix to this notice.\n\nAmendment to the Taiwan Final Determination\n\n    On April 9, 2025, the petitioner submitted a timely ministerial \nerror allegation regarding the Taiwan Final Determination.\\4\\ Commerce \nreviewed the record and, on April 25, 2025, agreed that the \npetitioner's allegation constituted a ministerial error within the \nmeaning of section 705(e) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.224(f).\\5\\ \nSpecifically, Commerce determined that it had erred in applying a \nbelow-de minimis subsidy rate under 19 CFR 351.308(j)(3) as the adverse \nfacts available rate for several unreported grants for Chang Chun \nPlastics Co. Ltd. (CCPC) discovered at verification.\\6\\ Pursuant to 19 \nCFR 351.224(e), Commerce is amending the Taiwan Final Determination to \ncorrect this ministerial error as described in the Ministerial Error \nMemorandum. Correcting this error changes the ad valorem subsidy rate \nfor CCPC, as well as the cash deposit rate for all other producers and \nexporters not individually examined. The revised rates are listed in \nthe ``Estimated Countervailing Duty Subsidy Rates'' section, below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See Petitioner's Ministerial Error Allegation.\n    \\5\\ See Memorandum, ``Allegations of Ministerial Errors in the \nFinal Determination,'' dated April 25, 2025 (Ministerial Error \nMemorandum).\n    \\6\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOrders\n\n    As stated above, based on the ITC's affirmative final \ndeterminations that an industry in the United States is materially \ninjured within the meaning of section 705(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act by \nreason of subsidized imports of epoxy resins from Korea and Taiwan,\\7\\ \nin accordance with section 705(c)(2) of the Act, Commerce is issuing \nthese CVD orders. Moreover, because the ITC determined that imports of \nepoxy resins from Korea and Taiwan are materially injuring a U.S. \nindustry, unliquidated entries of subject merchandise from Korea or \nTaiwan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, are \nsubject to the assessment of countervailing duties.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See ITC Notification Letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Therefore, in accordance with section 706(a) of the Act, Commerce \nis directing U.S. Customs Border and Protection (CBP) to continue \nsuspending liquidation of all relevant entries of epoxy resins from \nKorea, which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption \non or after April 3, 2025, the date of publication of the final \ndetermination. Additionally, in accordance with section 706(a) of the \nAct, Commerce intends to direct CBP to assess, upon further \ninstructions by Commerce, countervailing duties on all relevant entries \nof epoxy resins from Taiwan, which are entered, or withdrawn from \nwarehouse, for consumption on or after September 13, 2024, the date of \npublication of the Taiwan Preliminary Determination,\\8\\ but will not \ninclude entries occurring after the expiration of the provisional \nmeasures period and before the publication of the ITC's final injury \ndeterminations under section 705(b) of the Act, as further described in \nthe ``Provisional Measures'' section of this notice.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ See Certain Epoxy Resins from the Republic of Korea: \nPreliminary Negative Countervailing Duty Determination, Preliminary \nNegative Critical Circumstances Determination and Alignment of Final \nDetermination With Final Antidumping Duty Determination, 89 FR 74912 \n(September 13, 2024) (Korea Preliminary Determination); see also \nCertain Epoxy Resins from Taiwan: Preliminary Affirmative \nCountervailing Duty Determination, and Alignment of Final \nDetermination With Final Antidumping Duty Determination, 89 FR 74896 \n(September 13, 2024) (Taiwan Preliminary Determination).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSuspension of Liquidation and Cash Deposits\n\n    In accordance with section 706 of the Act, Commerce intends to \ninstruct CBP to continue suspending liquidation of epoxy resins from \nKorea, effective on the date of publication of the Korea Final \nDetermination, to reinstitute the suspension of liquidation of epoxy \nresins from Taiwan, effective on the date of publication of the ITC's \nfinal affirmative injury determination in the Federal Register, and to \nassess, upon\n\n[[Page 22236]]\n\nfurther instruction by Commerce, pursuant to section 706(a)(1) of the \nAct, countervailing duties on each entry of subject merchandise in an \namount based on the net countervailable subsidy rates below. On or \nafter the date of publication of the ITC's final injury determination \nin the Federal Register, CBP must require, at the same time as \nimporters would normally deposit estimated customs duties on subject \nmerchandise, a cash deposit equal to the rates listed in the table \nbelow. These instructions suspending liquidation will remain in effect \nuntil further notice.

Commerce published the Taiwan \nPreliminary Determination on September 13, 2024.\\13\\ As such, the four-\nmonth period beginning on the date of the publication of the Taiwan \nPreliminary Determination ended on January 10, 2025.\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See Taiwan Preliminary Determination, 89 FR at 74896.\n    \\14\\ Because the Korea Preliminary Determination was negative \nand Commerce did not begin suspension of liquidation until the Korea \nFinal Determination, provisional measures will not terminate for \nKorea before the date of publication of the ITC's final injury \ndetermination in the Federal Register.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Therefore, in accordance with section 703(d) of the Act, we \ninstructed CBP to terminate the suspension of liquidation and to \nliquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, unliquidated \nentries of epoxy resins from Taiwan or withdrawn from warehouse, for \nconsumption, on or after January 11, 2025, the date on which the \nprovisional measures expired, until and through the day preceding the \ndate of publication of the ITC's final injury determination in the \nFederal Register. Suspension of liquidation and the collection of cash \ndeposits will resume on the date of publication of the ITC's final \ndeterminations in the Federal Register.\n\nEstablishment of the Annual Inquiry Service Lists\n\n    On September 20, 2021, Commerce published the Final Rule in the \nFederal Register.\\15\\ On September 27, 2021, Commerce also published \nthe Procedural Guidance in the Federal Register.\\16\\ The Final Rule and \nProcedural Guidance provide that Commerce will maintain an annual \ninquiry service list for each order or suspended investigation, and any \ninterested party submitting a scope ruling application or request for \ncircumvention inquiry shall serve a copy of the application or request \non the persons on the annual inquiry service list for that order, as \nwell as any companion order covering the same merchandise from the same \ncountry of origin.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See Regulations to Improve Administration and Enforcement \nof Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Laws, 86 FR 52300 (September \n20, 2021) (Final Rule).\n    \\16\\ See Scope Ruling Application; Annual Inquiry Service List; \nand Informational Sessions, 86 FR 53205 (September 27, 2021) \n(Procedural Guidance).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In accordance with the Procedural Guidance, for orders published in \nthe Federal Register after November 4, 2021, Commerce will create an \nannual inquiry service list segment in Commerce's online e-filing and \ndocument management system, Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \nElectronic Service System (ACCESS), available at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>, within five business days of publication of the \nnotice of the order. Each annual inquiry service list will be saved in \nACCESS, under each case number, and under a specific segment type \ncalled ``AISL-Annual Inquiry Service List.'' \\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ This segment will be combined with the ACCESS Segment \nSpecific Information (SSI) field which will display the month in \nwhich the notice of the order or suspended investigation was \npublished in the Federal Register, also known as the anniversary \nmonth. For example, for an order under case number A-000-000 that \nwas published in the Federal Register in January, the relevant \nsegment and SSI combination will appear in ACCESS as ``AISL-January \nAnniversary.'' Note that there will be only one annual inquiry \nservice list segment per case number, and the anniversary month will \nbe pre-populated in ACCESS.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested parties who wish to be added to the annual inquiry \nservice list for an order must submit an entry of appearance to the \nannual inquiry service list segment for the order in ACCESS within 30 \ndays after the date of publication of the order. For ease of \nadministration, Commerce requests that law firms with more than one \nattorney representing interested parties in an order designate a lead \nattorney to be included on the annual inquiry service list. Commerce \nwill finalize the annual inquiry service list within five business days \nthereafter. As mentioned in the Procedural Guidance,\\18\\ the new annual \ninquiry service list will be in place until the following year, when \nthe Opportunity Notice for the anniversary month of the order is \npublished.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See Procedural Guidance, 86 FR at 53206.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Commerce may update an annual inquiry service list at any time as \nneeded based on interested parties' amendments to their entries of \nappearance to remove or otherwise modify their list of members and \nrepresentatives, or to update contact information. Any changes or \nannouncements pertaining to these procedures will be posted to the \nACCESS website at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>.\n\nSpecial Instructions for the Petitioner and Foreign Governments\n\n    In the Final Rule, Commerce stated that, ``after an initial request \nand placement on the annual inquiry service list, both petitioners and \nforeign governments will automatically be placed on the annual inquiry \nservice list in the years that follow.'' \\19\\ Accordingly, as stated \nabove, the petitioner, the Government of Korea, and the Taiwan \nAuthorities should submit their initial entries of appearance after \npublication of this notice in order to appear in the first annual \ninquiry service lists for these orders. Pursuant to 19 CFR \n351.225(n)(3), the petitioner, the Government of Korea, and the Taiwan \nAuthorities will not need to resubmit\n\n[[Page 22237]]\n\ntheir entries of appearance each year to continue to be included on the \nannual inquiry service list. However, the petitioner, the Government of \nKorea, and the Taiwan Authorities are responsible for making amendments \nto their entries of appearance during the annual update to the annual \ninquiry service list in accordance with the procedures described above.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ See Final Rule, 86 FR at 52335.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotification to Interested Parties\n\n    This notice constitutes the CVD orders with respect to epoxy resins \nfrom Korea and Taiwan, pursuant to section 706(a) of the Act. \nInterested parties can find a list of antidumping duty and CVD orders \ncurrently in effect at <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/datavisualization/adcvd-proceedings\">https://www.trade.gov/datavisualization/adcvd-proceedings</a>.\n    The amended Taiwan final determination and these CVD orders are \nissued and published in accordance with sections 705(e) and 706(a) of \nthe Act, and 19 CFR 351.224(e) and 19 CFR 351.211(b).\n\n    Dated: May 20, 2025.\nChristopher Abbott,\nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Policy and Negotiations, performing the \nnon-exclusive functions and duties of the Assistant Secretary for \nEnforcement and Compliance.\n\nAppendix\n\nScope of the Orders\n\n    The merchandise subject to these orders is fully or partially \nuncured epoxy resins, also known as epoxide resins, polyepoxides, \noxirane resins, ethoxyline resins, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol, \n(chloromethyl) oxirane, or aromatic diglycidyl, which are polymers \nor prepolymers containing epoxy groups (i.e., three-membered ring \nstructures comprised of two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom). Epoxy \nresins range in physical form from low viscosity liquids to solids. \nAll epoxy resins are covered by the scope of these orders \nirrespective of physical form, viscosity, grade, purity, molecular \nweight, or molecular structure, and packaging.\n    Epoxy resins may contain modifiers or additives, such as \nhardeners, curatives, colorants, pigments, diluents, solvents, \nthickeners, fillers, plasticizers, softeners, flame retardants, \ntoughening agents, catalysts, Bisphenol F, and ultraviolet light \ninhibitors, so long as the modifier or additive has not chemically \nreacted so as to cure the epoxy resin or convert it into a different \nproduct no longer containing epoxy groups.

We reviewed the allegations and determined that \nwe made a ministerial error in the Taiwan Final Determination. See \n``Amendment to the Taiwan Final Determination'' section below for \nfurther discussion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See Certain Epoxy Resins from South Korea: Final Affirmative \nDetermination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Final Negative \nDetermination of Critical Circumstances, 90 FR 14623 (April 3, \n2025); see also Certain Epoxy Resins from Taiwan: Final Affirmative \nDetermination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 90 FR 14611 (April \n3, 2025) (Taiwan Final Determination); and Certain Epoxy Resins from \nThailand: Final Affirmative Determination of Sales at Less-Than-Fair \nValue and Final Negative Determination of Critical Circumstances, 90 \nFR 14621 (April 3, 2025).\n    \\2\\ See Petitioner's Letter, ``Petitioner's Submission of \nMinisterial Error Comments,'' dated April 7, 2025 (Petitioner's \nAllegation); see also Nan Ya's Letter, ``Final Determination \nMinisterial Error Comments,'' dated April 7, 2025 (Nan Ya's \nAllegation).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On May 19, 2025, pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act, the ITC \nnotified Commerce of its final affirmative determinations that an \nindustry in the United States is materially injured by reason of LTFV \nimports of epoxy resins from Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand within the \nmeaning of section 735(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See ITC's Letter, ``Investigation Nos. 701-TA-716-719 and \n731-TA-1683-1687 (Final),'' dated May 19, 2025 (ITC Notification \nLetter).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScope of the Orders\n\n    The merchandise covered by these orders is epoxy resins from Korea, \nTaiwan, and Thailand. For a complete description of the scope of the \norders, see the appendix to this notice.\n\nAmendment to the Taiwan Final Determination\n\n    On April 7, 2025, the petitioner and Nan Ya submitted timely \nministerial error allegations in the Taiwan Final Determination.\\4\\ \nCommerce reviewed the record and, on April 28, 2025, agreed that the \npetitioner's allegation constituted a ministerial error within the \nmeaning of section 735(e) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.224(f).\\5\\ \nSpecifically, Commerce determined that it had erred in using an \nincorrect date format in the margin calculation program when correcting \nthe payment date for a specific U.S. sale based on the findings at \nverification, as the petitioner alleged; however, Commerce also \ndetermined that, because Nan Ya's allegation regarding the \nimplementation of partial adverse facts available for Nan Ya's U.S. \npacking costs pertained to a methodological decision, it was not a \nministerial error.\\6\\ Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.224(e), Commerce is \namending the Taiwan Final Determination to reflect the correction of \nthe ministerial error, as described in the Ministerial Error \nMemorandum. Correcting this error changes Nan Ya's final dumping \nmargin, as well as the cash deposit rate for all other producers and \nexporters not individually examined. The amended estimated weighted-\naverage dumping margins for Taiwan are listed in the ``Estimated \nWeighted-Average Dumping Margins'' section, below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See Petitioner's Allegation; see also Nan Ya's Allegation.\n    \\5\\ See Memorandum, ``Less-Than-Fair-Value Investigation of \nCertain Epoxy Resins from Taiwan: Analysis of Ministerial Error \nAllegations,'' dated April 28, 2025 (Ministerial Error Memorandum).\n    \\6\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOrders\n\n    As stated above, based on the ITC's affirmative final \ndeterminations that an industry in the United States is materially \ninjured within the meaning of section 735(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act by \nreason of LTFV imports of epoxy resins from Korea, Taiwan, and \nThailand,\\7\\ in accordance with section 735(c)(2) of the Act, Commerce \nis issuing these AD orders. Moreover, because the ITC determined that \nimports of epoxy resins from Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand are materially \ninjuring a U.S. industry, unliquidated entries of subject merchandise \nfrom Korea, Taiwan, or Thailand entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, \nfor consumption, are subject to the assessment of antidumping duties.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See ITC Notification Letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Therefore, in accordance with section 736(a)(1) of the Act, \nCommerce intends to direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to \nassess, upon further instructions by Commerce, antidumping duties equal \nto the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the \nexport price (or constructed export price) of the merchandise, on all \nrelevant entries of epoxy resins from Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, \nwhich are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or \nafter November 13, 2024, the date of publication of the Preliminary \nDeterminations,\\8\\ but will not include entries after the expiration of \nthe provisional measures period and before publication of the ITC's \nfinal injury determinations under section 735(d) of the Act, as further \ndescribed in the ``Provisional Measures'' section of this notice.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ See Certain Epoxy Resins from the Republic of Korea: \nPreliminary Affirmative Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair \nValue, Preliminary Negative Critical Circumstances Determination, \nPostponement of Final Determination, and Extension of Provisional \nMeasures, 89 FR 89605 (November 13, 2024); Certain Epoxy Resins from \nTaiwan: Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Sales at Less Than \nFair Value, Postponement of Final Determination, and Extension of \nProvisional Measures, 89 FR 89591 (November 13, 2024); and Certain \nEpoxy Resins from Thailand: Preliminary Affirmative Determination of \nSales at Less Than Fair Value, Preliminary Negative Determination of \nCritical Circumstances, Postponement of Final Determination, and \nExtension of Provisional Measures, 89 FR 89608 (November 13, 2024) \n(collectively, Preliminary Determinations).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nContinuation of Suspension of Liquidation and Cash Deposits\n\n    Except as noted in the ``Provisional Measures'' section of this \nnotice, in accordance with section 735(c)(1)(B) of the Act, Commerce \nintends to instruct CBP to continue to suspend liquidation on all \nrelevant entries of epoxy resins from Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. \nThese instructions suspending liquidation will remain in effect until \nfurther notice.\n    Commerce will also instruct CBP to require cash deposits equal to \nthe estimated weighted-average dumping margins indicated in the tables \nbelow. Effective on the date of publication in the Federal Register of \nthe notice of the ITC's final affirmative injury determinations, CBP \nwill require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit \nestimated customs duties on subject merchandise, a cash deposit equal \nto the rates listed in the table below.

Therefore, in accordance with section 733(d) of \nthe Act and our practice,\\10\\ Commerce will instruct CBP to terminate \nthe suspension of liquidation and to liquidate, without regard to \nantidumping duties, unliquidated entries of epoxy resins from Korea, \nTaiwan, and Thailand entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for \nconsumption on or after May 12, 2025, the date on which the provisional \nmeasures expired, until and through the day preceding the date of \npublication of the ITC's final affirmative injury determinations in the \nFederal Register. Suspension of liquidation and the collection of cash \ndeposits will resume on the date of publication of the ITC's final \ndeterminations in the Federal Register.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ Id..\n    \\10\\ See, e.g., Certain Corrosion-Resistant Steel Products from \nIndia, India, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea \nand Taiwan: Amended Final Affirmative Antidumping Determination for \nIndia and Taiwan, and Antidumping Duty Orders, 81 FR 48390, 48392 \n(July 25, 2016).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEstablishment of the Annual Inquiry Service Lists\n\n    On September 20, 2021, Commerce published the Final Rule in the \nFederal Register.\\11\\ On September 27, 2021, Commerce also published \nthe Procedural Guidance in the Federal Register.\\12\\ The Final Rule and \nProcedural Guidance provide that Commerce will maintain an annual \ninquiry service list for each order or suspended investigation, and any \ninterested party submitting a scope ruling application or request for \ncircumvention inquiry shall serve a copy of the application or request \non the persons on the annual inquiry service list for that order, as \nwell as any companion order covering the same merchandise from the same \ncountry of origin.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See Regulations to Improve Administration and Enforcement \nof Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Laws, 86 FR 52300 (September \n20, 2021) (Final Rule).\n    \\12\\ See Scope Ruling Application; Annual Inquiry Service List; \nand Informational Sessions, 86 FR 53205 (September 27, 2021) \n(Procedural Guidance).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In accordance with the Procedural Guidance, for orders published in \nthe Federal Register after November 4, 2021, Commerce will create an \nannual inquiry service list segment in Commerce's online e-filing and \ndocument management system, Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \nElectronic Service System (ACCESS), available at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>, within five business days of publication of the \nnotice of the order. Each annual inquiry service list will be saved in \nACCESS, under each case number, and under a specific segment type \ncalled ``AISL-Annual Inquiry Service List.'' \\13\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ This segment will be combined with the ACCESS Segment \nSpecific Information (SSI) field, which will display the month in \nwhich the notice of the order or suspended investigation was \npublished in the Federal Register, also known as the anniversary \nmonth. For example, for an order under case number A-000-000 that \npublished in the Federal Register in January, the relevant segment \nand SSI combination will appear in ACCESS as ``AISL-January \nAnniversary.'' Note that there will be only one annual inquiry \nservice list segment per case number, and the anniversary month will \nbe pre-populated in ACCESS.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested parties who wish to be added to the annual inquiry \nservice list for an order must submit an entry of appearance to the \nannual inquiry service list segment for the order in ACCESS within 30 \ndays after the date of publication of the order. For ease of \nadministration, Commerce requests that law firms with more than one \nattorney representing interested parties in an order designate a lead \nattorney to be included on the annual inquiry service list. Commerce \nwill finalize the annual inquiry service list within five business days \nthereafter. As mentioned in the Procedural Guidance,\\14\\ the new annual \ninquiry service list will be in place until the following year, when \nthe Opportunity Notice for the anniversary month of the order is \npublished.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ See Procedural Guidance, 86 FR at 53206.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Commerce may update an annual inquiry service list at any time as\n\n[[Page 22240]]\n\nneeded based on interested parties' amendments to their entries of \nappearance to remove or otherwise modify their list of members and \nrepresentatives, or to update contact information. Changes or \nannouncements pertaining to these procedures will be posted to the \nACCESS website at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>.\n\nSpecial Instructions for the Petitioner and Foreign Governments\n\n    In the Final Rule, Commerce stated that, ``after an initial request \nand placement on the annual inquiry service list, both petitioners and \nforeign governments will automatically be placed on the annual inquiry \nservice list in the years that follow.'' \\15\\ Accordingly, as stated \nabove, the petitioner and foreign governments should submit their \ninitial entry of appearance after publication of this notice in order \nto appear in the first annual inquiry service lists for these orders. \nPursuant to 19 CFR 351.225(n)(3), the petitioner and foreign \ngovernments will not need to resubmit their entries of appearance each \nyear to continue to be included on the annual inquiry service list. \nHowever, the petitioners and foreign governments are responsible for \nmaking amendments to their entries of appearance during the annual \nupdate to the annual inquiry service list in accordance with the \nprocedures described above.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See Final Rule, 86 FR at 52335.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotification to Interested Parties\n\n    This notice constitutes the AD orders with respect to epoxy resins \nfrom Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand pursuant to section 736(a) of the Act. \nInterested parties can find a list of AD and countervailing duty orders \ncurrently in effect at <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/data-visualization/adcvd-proceedings\">https://www.trade.gov/data-visualization/adcvd-proceedings</a>.\n    The amended Taiwan final determination and these AD orders are \npublished in accordance with sections 735(e) and 736(a) of the Act and \n19 CFR 351.224(e) and 19 CFR 351.211(b).\n\n    Dated: May 20, 2025.\nChristopher Abbott,\nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Policy and Negotiations, performing the \nnon-exclusive functions and duties of the Assistant Secretary for \nEnforcement and Compliance.\n\nAppendix\n\nScope of the Orders\n\n    The merchandise subject to these orders is fully or partially \nuncured epoxy resins, also known as epoxide resins, polyepoxides, \noxirane resins, ethoxyline resins, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol, \n(chloromethyl) oxirane, or aromatic diglycidyl, which are polymers \nor prepolymers containing epoxy groups (i.e., three-membered ring \nstructures comprised of two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom). Epoxy \nresins range in physical form from low viscosity liquids to solids. \nAll epoxy resins are covered by the scope of these orders \nirrespective of physical form, viscosity, grade, purity, molecular \nweight, or molecular structure, and packaging.\n    Epoxy resins may contain modifiers or additives, such as \nhardeners, curatives, colorants, pigments, diluents, solvents, \nthickeners, fillers, plasticizers, softeners, flame retardants, \ntoughening agents, catalysts, Bisphenol F, and ultraviolet light \ninhibitors, so long as the modifier or additive has not chemically \nreacted so as to cure the epoxy resin or convert it into a different \nproduct no longer containing epoxy groups. Such epoxy resins with \nmodifiers or additives are included in the scope where the epoxy \nresin component comprises no less than 30 percent of the total \nweight of the product. The scope also includes blends of epoxy \nresins with different types of epoxy resins, with or without the \ninclusion of modifiers and additives, so long as the combined epoxy \nresin component comprises at least 30 percent of the total weight of \nthe blend.\n    Epoxy resins that enter as part of a system or kit with \nseparately packaged co-reactants, such as hardeners or curing \nagents, are within the scope. The scope does not include any \nseparately packaged co-reactants that would not fall within the \nscope if entered on their own.\n    The scope includes merchandise matching the above description \nthat has been processed in a third country, including by \ncommingling, diluting, introducing, or removing modifiers or \nadditives, or performing any other processing that would not \notherwise remove the merchandise from the scope of the orders if \nperformed in the subject country.\n    The scope also includes epoxy resin that is commingled or \nblended with epoxy resin from sources not subject to these orders. \nOnly the subject component of such commingled products is covered by \nthe scope of these orders. Excluded from the scope are phenoxy \nresins, which are polymers with a weight greater than 11,000 \nDaltons, a Melt Flow Index (MFI) at 200 [deg]C (392 [deg]F) no less \nthan 4 grams and no greater than 70 grams per 10 min, Glass-\nTransition Temperatures (Tg) no less than 80 [deg]C (176 [deg]F) and \nno greater than 100 [deg]C (212 [deg]F), and which contain no epoxy \ngroups other than at the terminal ends of the molecule.\n    Excluded from the scope are certain paint and coating products, \nwhich are blends, mixtures, or other formulations of epoxy resin, \ncuring agent, and pigment, in any form, packaged in one or more \ncontainers, wherein (1) the pigment represents a minimum of 10 \npercent of the total weight of the product, (2) the epoxy resin \nrepresents a maximum of 80 percent of the total weight of the \nproduct, and (3) the curing agent represents 5 to 40 percent of the \ntotal weight of the product.\n    Excluded from the scope are preimpregnated fabrics or fibers, \noften referred to as ``pre-pregs,'' which are composite materials \nconsisting of fabrics or fibers (typically carbon or glass) \nimpregnated with epoxy resin.\n    Also excluded from the scope is Tetramethyl Bisphenol F \nDiglycidyl Ether epoxy resin, also known as Tetramethyl Bisphenol F \n-DGE Polymer (TMBPF-DGE), that (1) has the chemical name: phenol, 4, \n4'-methylenebis[2,6-dimethyl-, polymer with 2-(chloromethyl)oxirane, \n(2) falls under Chemical Abstract Services (CAS) Registry Number \n113693-69-9, and (3) has an epoxy equivalent weight (EEW), also \nreferred to as the weight per epoxide (WPE), of no less than 200 and \nno greater than 230 grams of epoxy resin per epoxy equivalent (g/eq \nor GEW).\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ The bracket in this sentence is part of the chemical \nformula and does not denote business proprietary information.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    This merchandise is currently classifiable under Harmonized \nTariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheading \n3907.30.0000.

For a full description of \nthe scope of the Order, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum.\n\nAnalysis of Comments Received\n\n    All issues raised in the case and rebuttal briefs are addressed in \nthe Issues and Decision Memorandum. A list of the issues parties raised \nand to which we responded in the Issues and Decision Memorandum is \nprovided in Appendix I to this notice. The Issues and Decision \nMemorandum is a public document and is on file electronically via \nEnforcement and Compliance's Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \nCentralized Electronic Service System (ACCESS). ACCESS is available to \nregistered users at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>. In addition, a complete \nversion of the Issues and Decision Memorandum can be accessed directly \nat <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov/public/FRNoticesListLayout.aspx\">https://access.trade.gov/public/FRNoticesListLayout.aspx</a>.\n\nFinal Determination of No Shipments\n\n    In the Preliminary Results, Commerce determined that Shanghai Smart \nand Deosen Biochemical Ltd. did not have shipments of subject \nmerchandise during the POR.\\6\\ As we received no information to \ncontradict our preliminary determination with respect to Deosen \nBiochemical Ltd. and Shanghai Smart, we continue to find that they made \nno shipments of subject merchandise to the United States during the \nPOR.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ See Preliminary Results, 89 FR at 68136.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges Since the Preliminary Results\n\n    Based on a review of the record, findings at verification, and \ncomments received from interested parties regarding our Preliminary \nResults, we made certain changes to the preliminary weighted-average \ndumping margin calculation for Deosen. For further discussion of these \nchanges, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum.\n\nSeparate Rates\n\n    No parties commented on our preliminary separate rate \ndeterminations. Therefore, we have continued to grant separate rate \nstatus to Fufeng, Deosen, and two other companies/company groups, \nJianlong and CP Kelco (Shandong).\n\nRate for Non-Examined Separate Rate Respondents\n\n    The statue and Commerce's regulations do not address what rate to \napply to respondents not selected for individual examination when \nCommerce limits its examination in an administrative review pursuant to \nsection 777A(c)(2) of the Act. Generally, Commerce looks to section \n735(c)(5) of the Act, which provides instructions for calculating the \nall-others rate in an investigation, for guidance when calculating the \nrate for non-selected respondents that are not examined individually in \nan administrative review. Section 735(c)(5)(A) of the Act states that \nthe all-others rate should be calculated by averaging the weighted-\naverage dumping margins calculated for individually-examined \nrespondents, excluding dumping margins that are zero, de minimis, or \nbased entirely on facts available. When the rates for individually \nexamined companies are all zero, de minimis, or based entirely on facts \navailable, section 735(c)(5)(B) of the Act provides that Commerce may \nuse ``any reasonable method'' to establish the all-others rate. In this \nreview, Commerce preliminarily found a zero rate for Fufeng. Therefore, \nthe only rate that is not zero, de minimis or based entirely on facts \notherwise available is the rate calculated for Deosen. Consequently, we \nhave assigned the separate rate respondents a rate equal to the \ncalculated weighted-average dumping margin for the mandatory respondent \nwhose rate was not zero, de minimis, or based entirely on facts \navailable (i.e., the weighted-average dumping margin for Deosen). This \napproach is consistent with the intent of, and our use of, section \n735(c)(5)(A) of the Act.\\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See, e.g., Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from the \nSocialist Republic of Vietnam: Final Results and Final Partial \nRescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 76 FR 56158, \n56160 (September 12, 2011).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChina-Wide Entity\n\n    Under Commerce's policy regarding the conditional review of the \nChina-wide entity,\\8\\ the China-wide entity will not be under review \nunless a party specifically requests, or Commerce self-initiates, a \nreview of the entity. Because no party requested a review of the China-\nwide entity in this review, the entity is not under review, and the \nentity's rate (i.e., 154.07 percent) is not subject to change.\\9\\ \nConsistent with the Preliminary Results, we have continued to deny \nseparate rate status to the companies identified in Appendix II.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ See Antidumping Proceedings: Announcement of Change in \nDepartment Practice for Respondent Selection in Antidumping Duty \nProceedings and Conditional Review of the Nonmarket Economy Entity \nin NME Antidumping Duty Proceedings, 78 FR 65963 (November 4, 2013).\n    \\9\\ See Order, 78 FR at 43144.\n    \\10\\ See Appendix II; see also Preliminary Results PDM at 11.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Results of Review\n\n    We determine that the following estimated dumping margins exist for \nthe period July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ Commerce continues to find that Neimenggu Fufeng \nBiotechnologies Co., Ltd.

Commerce intends to issue assessment instructions to CBP no \nearlier than 35 days after the publication date of these final results \nin the Federal Register. If a timely summons is filed at the U.S. Court \nof International Trade, the assessment instructions will direct CBP not \nto liquidate relevant entries until the time for parties to file a \nrequest for a statutory injunction has expired (i.e., within 90 days of \npublication).\n    For Deosen, Commerce will calculate importer-specific assessment \nrates for antidumping duties, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1). \nWhere the respondent reported reliable entered values, Commerce intends \nto calculate importer-specific ad valorem assessment rates by \naggregating the amount of dumping calculated for all U.S. sales to the \nimporter and dividing this amount by the total entered value of the \nmerchandise sold to the importer.\\13\\ Where the respondent did not \nreport entered values, Commerce will calculate importer-specific \nassessment rates by dividing the amount of dumping for reviewed sales \nto the importer by the total quantity of those sales. Commerce will \ncalculate an estimated ad valorem importer-specific assessment rate to \ndetermine whether the per-unit assessment rate is de minimis (i.e., \n0.50 percent or below); however, Commerce will use the per-unit \nassessment rate where entered values were not reported.\\14\\ Where an \nimporter-specific ad valorem assessment rate is not zero or de minimis, \nCommerce will instruct CBP to collect the appropriate duties at the \ntime of liquidation. Where an importer-specific ad valorem assessment \nrate is zero or de minimis, Commerce will instruct CBP to liquidate \nappropriate entries without regard to antidumping duties.\\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1).\n    \\14\\ Id.\n    \\15\\ See 19 CFR 351.106(c)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For Fufeng, because its final weighted-average dumping margin is \nzero, Commerce will instruct CBP to liquidate the appropriate entries \nwithout regard to antidumping duties.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For entries submitted by an exporter individually examined during \nthis review that were not reported in the U.S. sales database, but that \nentered under the case number of that exporter (i.e., at the \nindividually-examined exporter's cash deposit rate), Commerce will \ninstruct CBP to liquidate such entries at the China-wide entity rate \n(i.e., 154.07 percent).\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ See Order, 78 FR at 43144.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For respondents not individually examined in this administrative \nreview that qualified for a separate rate (i.e., CP Kelco (Shandong) \nand Jianlong), the assessment rate will be equal to the weighted-\naverage dumping margin assigned to the respondent (i.e., Deosen) in the \nfinal results of this review.\\18\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See Drawn Stainless Steel Sinks from the People's Republic \nof China: Preliminary Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative \nReview and Preliminary Determination of No Shipments: 2014-2015, 81 \nFR 29528 (May 12, 2016), and accompanying PDM at 10-11, unchanged in \nDrawn Stainless Steel Sinks from the People's Republic of China: \nFinal Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Final \nDetermination of No Shipments; 2014-2015, 81 FR 54042 (August 15, \n2016).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For the respondents not eligible for a separate rate, as listed in \nAppendix II, that are part of the China-wide entity, we intend to \ninstruct CBP to apply an ad valorem assessment rate of 154.07 percent \n(i.e., the China-wide entity rate) to all entries of subject \nmerchandise exported by these companies during the POR.\n    Additionally, for the above companies for which we made final no \nshipment determinations, any suspended entries that entered under that \nexporter's case number will be liquidated at the China-wide entity \nrate.\n\nCash Deposit Requirements\n\n    Pursuant to section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act, the cash deposit \nrequirements effective for shipments of the subject merchandise \nentered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the \npublication date of the final results of review will be as follows: (1) \nfor the exporters listed in the table above, the cash deposit rate will \nbe the rate indicated; (2) for previously investigated or reviewed \nexporters of subject merchandise not listed in the table above that \nhave separate rates, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the most \nrecently published exporter-specific rate; (3) for all China exporters \nof subject merchandise that have not been found to be entitled to a \nseparate rate, the cash deposit rate will be the rate previously \nestablished for the China-wide entity (154.07 percent); and (4) for all \nnon-China exporters of subject merchandise which have not received \ntheir own rate, the cash deposit rate will be the rate applicable to \nthe China exporter that supplied that non-China exporter. The cash \ndeposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until \nfurther notice.\n\nNotification of Importers\n\n    This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their \nresponsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate \nregarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation \nof the relevant entries during the POR. Failure to comply with this \nrequirement could result in Commerce's presumption that\n\n[[Page 22243]]\n\nreimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent \nassessment of double antidumping duties.\n\nAdministrative Protective Order (APO)\n\n    This notice also serves as a final reminder to parties subject to \nan APO of their responsibility to return or destroy proprietary \ninformation disclosed under an APO in accordance with 19 CFR \n351.305(a)(3). Timely written notification of the return or destruction \nof APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby \nrequested.

Because the ITC determined that imports of \n2,4-D from India and China are materially injuring a U.S. industry, \nunliquidated entries of such merchandise from India and China, entered \nor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, are subject to the \nassessment of antidumping duties.\n    Therefore, in accordance with section 736(a)(1) of the Act, \nCommerce will direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to \nassess, upon further instruction by Commerce, antidumping duties equal \nto the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the \nexport price (or constructed export price) of the merchandise on all \nrelevant entries of 2,4-D from India and\n\n[[Page 22244]]\n\nChina.

These instructions suspending \nliquidations will remain in effect until further notice.\n    Commerce also intends to instruct CBP to require cash deposits \nequal to the estimated weighted-average dumping margins indicated in \nthe tables below, adjusted by the relevant export subsidy offsets. \nAccordingly, effective on the date of publication in the Federal \nRegister of the notice of the ITC's final affirmative injury \ndetermination, CBP must require, at the same time as importers would \nnormally deposit estimated customs duties on subject merchandise, a \ncash deposit equal to the rates listed in the tables below. The all-\nothers rate applies to all producers or exporters not specifically \nlisted, as appropriate.\n\nEstimated Weighted-Average Dumping Margins\n\n    The estimated weighted-average dumping margins are as follows:\n\nIndia\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Cash deposit rate\n                                 Weighted-average       (adjusted for\n       Producer/exporter          dumping margin      subsidy offsets)\n                                     (percent)            (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAtul Limited..................               25.85                 20.62\nMeghmani Organics Limited.....                6.10                  3.18\nAll Others....................               15.98                 11.90\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChina\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                Weighted-average     Cash deposit rate\n      Producer/exporter          dumping margin    (adjusted for subsidy\n                                   (percent)         offsets) (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChina-Wide Entity...........            * 127.21                 126.58\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Rate based on facts available with adverse inferences.\n\nProvisional Measures\n\n    Section 733(d) of the Act states that suspension of liquidation \npursuant to an affirmative preliminary determination may not remain in \neffect for more than four months, except where exporters representing a \nsignificant proportion of exports of the subject merchandise request \nthat Commerce extend the four-month period to no more than six months. \nAt the request of exporters that accounted for a significant proportion \nof exports of 2,4-D from India and China, Commerce extended the four-\nmonth period to no more than six months.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See LTFV Preliminary Determinations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Commerce published the LTFV Preliminary Determinations on November \n14, 2024; therefore, the six-month provisional measures period \nbeginning on the date of the publication of the LTFV Preliminary \nDeterminations ended on May 12, 2025. Therefore, in accordance with \nsection 736(a)(1) of the Act and our practice,\\5\\ Commerce will \ninstruct CBP to terminate the suspension of liquidation and to \nliquidate, without regard to antidumping duties, unliquidated entries \nof 2,4-D from India and China entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for \nconsumption on or after May 13, 2025, the first day provisional \nmeasures were no longer in effect, until and through the day preceding \nthe date of publication of the ITC's final injury determination in the \nFederal Register.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See, e.g., Certain Corrosion-Resistant Steel Products from \nIndia, India, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea \nand Taiwan: Amended Final Affirmative Antidumping Determination for \nIndia and Taiwan, and Antidumping Duty Orders, 81 FR 48390, 48392 \n(July 25, 2016).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Suspension of liquidation and the collection of cash deposits will \nresume on the date of publication of the ITC's final determination in \nthe Federal Register.\n\nEstablishment of the Annual Inquiry Service Lists\n\n    On September 20, 2021, Commerce published the Final Rule in the \nFederal Register.\\6\\ On September 27, 2021, Commerce also published the \nProcedural Guidance in the Federal Register.\\7\\ The Final Rule and \nProcedural Guidance provide that Commerce will maintain an annual \ninquiry service list for each order or suspended investigation, and any \ninterested party submitting a scope ruling application or request for \ncircumvention inquiry shall serve a copy of the application or request \non the persons on the annual inquiry service list for that order, as \nwell as any companion order covering the same merchandise from the same \ncountry of origin.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ See Regulations to Improve Administration and Enforcement of \nAntidumping and Countervailing Duty Laws, 86 FR 52300 (September 20, \n2021) (Final Rule).\n    \\7\\ See Scope Ruling Application; Annual Inquiry Service List; \nand Informational Sessions, 86 FR 53205 (September 27, 2021) \n(Procedural Guidance).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22245]]\n\n    In accordance with the Procedural Guidance, for orders published in \nthe Federal Register after November 4, 2021, Commerce will create an \nannual inquiry service list segment in Commerce's online e-filing and \ndocument management system, Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \nElectronic Service System (ACCESS), available at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>, within five business days of publication of the \nnotice of the order. Each annual inquiry service list will be saved in \nACCESS, under each case number, and under a specific segment type \ncalled ``AISL-Annual Inquiry Service List.'' \\8\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ This segment will be combined with the ACCESS Segment \nSpecific Information (SSI) field which will display the month in \nwhich the notice of the order or suspended investigation was \npublished in the Federal Register, also known as the anniversary \nmonth. For example, for an order under case number A-000-000 that \nwas published in the Federal Register in January, the relevant \nsegment and SSI combination will appear in ACCESS as ``AISL-January \nAnniversary.'' Note that there will be only one annual inquiry \nservice list segment per case number, and the anniversary month will \nbe pre-populated in ACCESS.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested parties who wish to be added to the annual inquiry \nservice list for an order must submit an entry of appearance to the \nannual inquiry service list segment for the order in ACCESS within 30 \ndays after the date of publication of the order. For ease of \nadministration, Commerce requests that law firms with more than one \nattorney representing interested parties in an order designate a lead \nattorney to be included on the annual inquiry service list. Commerce \nwill finalize the annual inquiry service list within five business days \nthereafter.

This application has been accepted and is now ready for \nenvironmental analysis.\n    l. The Lowell Project consists of: (1) the 1,093-foot-long, 15-\nfoot-high Pawtucket Dam and spillway, equipped with a 5-foot-high \npneumatic crest gate with a crest elevation of 92.2 feet National \nGeodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29) at the top of the gate; (2) a \n1,236-acre impoundment with a normal maximum water surface elevation of \n92.2 feet NGVD 29; (3) a 5.5-mile-long, two-tiered canal system that \nincludes the 4,300 foot-long Northern Canal and the 9,000-foot-long \nPawtucket Canal (canal system), along with a series of connected water \nways, small dams, gatehouses, and generating facilities; (4) a 125-\nfoot-long, 55-foot-high gatehouse that controls flow from the \nimpoundment to the Northern Canal (Pawtucket Gatehouse); (5) a 70-foot-\nlong, 20-foot-high, five-bay gatehouse that control flows from the \nimpoundment to the Pawtucket Canal as part of the Guard Lock and Gates \nFacility, which also includes a boat navigation lock and a Francis Gate \nfacility with a 25-foot-wide, 25-foot-high flood gate; (6) generating \nfacilities, including: (a) the Eldred L. (E.L.) Field Power Station, \nwhich is located on the mainstem of the Merrimack River and consists \nof: (i) a 109-foot-long, 96-foot-wide concrete powerhouse with two \nturbine-generator units with a total installed capacity of 15,012 \nkilowatts (kW); (ii) a 200-foot-long. 80-foot-wide forebay; (iii) a \n100-foot-long, 26-foot-wide, 22.25-foot-high canal control structure \nthat maintains water levels in the forebay as part of a Hydro Locks \nFacility, which also includes a boat navigation lock; (iv) a 440-foot-\nlong tailrace with a 10- to-16-foot high concrete training wall; (v) \ntwo 4.16-kilovolt (kV) generator leads; (vi) a 4.16/13.8-kV step-up \ntransformer; and (vi) appurtenant facilities; (b) the Hamilton Power \nStation, which is located on the canal system and consists of: (i) five \nturbine-generator units with a total installed capacity of 1,180 kW; \n(ii) five 0.6-kV generator leads; and (iii) appurtenant facilities; (c) \nthe Assets Power Station, which is located on the canal system and \nconsists of: (i) three turbine-generator units with a total installed \ncapacity of 792 kW; (ii) three 0.6-kV generator leads; and (iii) \nappurtenant facilities; (d) the Bridge Street Power Station, which is \nlocated on the canal system and consists of: (i) three turbine-\ngenerator units with a total installed capacity of 1,080 kW; (ii) three \n0.6-kV generator leads; and (iii) appurtenant facilities; and (e) the \nJohn Street Power Station, which is located on the canal system and \nconsists of: (i) four turbine-generator units with a total installed \ncapacity of 2,100 kW; (ii) four 0.6-kV generator leads; and (iii) \nappurtenant facilities; (7) a 4.5-mile-long, 13.8-kV submarine cable \nthat connects the project generating facilities to the regional \nelectric grid; (8) upstream and downstream fish passage facilities; and \n(9) a visitor center.\n    The project bypasses approximately 2 miles of the Merrimack River, \nincluding a 0.7-mile-long bypassed reach from the Pawtucket Dam to the \nE.L. Field Powerhouse tailrace and an approximately 1.3-mile-long \nbypassed reach from the E.L. Field Powerhouse tailrace to the \nconfluence of the Merrimack and Concord Rivers.\n    The current license requires Boott to operate in run-of-river mode.\n    Fish passage facilities include a fish elevator and downstream fish \nbypass at the E.L. Field Powerhouse, and a fish ladder at the Pawtucket \nDam.\n    The fish elevator at the E.L. Field Powerhouse has a design \ndischarge capacity of 200 cubic feet per second (cfs). Fish migrating \nupstream through the tailrace channel enter a collection gallery, where \nthey are attracted to a crowding pool and then into the elevator. Once \nin the elevator, fish are lifted in a hopper to the exit channel. Fish \nthen pass from the exit channel to the Northern Canal, where they swim \nupstream until they rejoin the Merrimack River upstream of Pawtucket \nDam. The fish elevator system includes areas where fish can be counted \nor trapped before swimming from the exit channel to the Northern Canal.\n    The downstream fishway at the E.L. Field Powerhouse consists of an \nadjustable-flow sluiceway and bypass adjacent to the powerhouse intake. \nDownstream migrating fish entering the bypass are sluiced into a plunge \npool located in the bypassed reach, next to the powerhouse.\n    The fish ladder at the Pawtucket Dam is designed for river flows up \nto 25,000 cfs and has an operating flow of 500 cfs (including fish \nattraction flow). The fish ladder is a vertical-slot design with 13-\nfoot-wide by 10-foot-long pools. A counting station and fish trap area \nare also provided at the fish ladder.\n    Recreation facilities at the project consist of a visitor center at \nthe E.L. Field Powerhouse. The visitor center offers a view of the \nturbines and an interpretive display providing information about the \nproject and the area.\n    The minimum and maximum hydraulic capacities of the project are 500 \ncfs and 8,600 cfs, respectively. The average annual generation of the \nproject was approximately 84,501 megawatt-hours from 2008 through 2017.\n    Boott proposes to: (1) continue to operate the project in a run-of-\nriver mode; (2) release 500 cfs into the bypassed reach from the \nexisting Pawtucket Dam fish ladder during the upstream migratory fish \npassage season, defined annually in consultation with the Merrimack \nRiver Technical Committee, and release 100 cfs, or inflow, whichever is \nless, to the bypassed reach from Pawtucket Dam during the rest of the \nyear; (3) continue to implement the Crest Gate Operation Plan; \\1\\ (4) \ncontinue to maintain and monitor a water surface elevation of 86.7 feet \nNVGD29 in the upper canal system and 71.8 feet NGVD29 in the lower \ncanal system; (5) continue to operate the gates of the Guard Lock and \nGates Facility to manage water levels in the canal system; (6) develop \nan operation and compliance monitoring plan; (7) replace the existing \nfish elevator with a short fish ladder to pass migratory fish from the \nE.L. Field Powerhouse tailrace upstream to the bypassed reach within \nthree years of license issuance; (8) conduct a 1-year ``shakedown'' \nperiod of the proposed fish ladder after installation; (9) evaluate the \neffectiveness of the proposed tailrace fish ladder after installation; \n(10) modify the existing Pawtucket Dam fish ladder to enhance upstream \nfish passage; (11) modify the bypassed reach\n\n[[Page 22284]]\n\nto enhance upstream fish passage; (12) install a new ``fish exclusion \nfacility'' at the E.L. Field Powerhouse that would consist of a 0.75-\ninch clear-spaced trashrack overlay, modifications to the existing \ndownstream fish bypass, and an American eel sampling device; (13) \ndevelop an interim nighttime shutdown plan to protect eels from turbine \nentrainment and impingement; (14) develop an upstream American eel \npassage assessment study plan; (15) develop a fishway operation and \nmanagement plan; (16) decommission the Assets, Hamilton, John Street, \nand Bridge Street powerhouses; (17) develop a decommissioning plan; \n(18) develop an historic properties management plan; (19) prior to any \nconstruction activities, consult with the Massachusetts State Historic \nPreservation Office and the National Park Service to develop a \nmitigation plan for avoiding or minimizing adverse effects on the Locks \nand Canals Historic District and the Lowell National Historical Park; \n(20) develop a recreation access and facilities management plan; and \n(21) modify the current project boundary to: (i) remove a 7.4-mile \nsection from the upstream extent of the impoundment; (ii) remove all \nexcept the first 2,200-foot-long section from the Northern Canal \nbetween the Pawtucket Dam and the Pawtucket Gatehouse; and (iii) remove \nall except the first 1,600-foot-long section of the Pawtucket Canal \nbetween the impoundment and the Guard Lock and Gates Facility.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ The Commission approved the Crest Gate Operation Plan on \nMarch 30, 2015.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    m.

It \nincludes burden and costs associated with developing and modifying \npermits, complying with NO<INF>X</INF> permitting requirements, \nmonitoring emissions, transferring allowances, and participating in the \nannual allowance auctions.\n    Form Numbers: Agent Notice of Delegation #5900-172, Certificate of \nRepresentation #7610-1, General Account Form #7610-5, Allowance \nTransfer Form #7610-6, Retired Unit Exemption#7610-20, Allowance \nDeduction #7620-4, Acid Rain Permit Application #7610-16, Acid Rain \nNO<INF>X</INF>Compliance Plan #7610-28, Acid Rain \nNO<INF>X</INF>Averaging Plan #7610-29, New Unit Exemption #7610-19, \nOpt-In Permit Application #7610-26, Opt-In Utilization Report #7620-9, \nLetter of Credit #7610-7A, EPA Allowance Auctions--Additional \nInformation for Certified Checks or Wire Transfers #7610-7, \nSO<INF>2</INF> Allowance Offer Form #7610-8, Thermal Energy Plan #7610-\n27, Notification For Distribution of Proceeds From EPA Auctions #7610-\n11, Opt-In Reduction from Improved Efficiency Confirmation Report \n#7620-8, Thermal Energy Compliance Report #7620-10.\n    Respondents/affected entities: Electricity generating plants, \nindustrialsources, and other persons.\n    Respondent's obligation to respond: Voluntary and mandatory (Clean \nAir Act sections 403, 407, 408, 410, 412, and 416).\n    Estimated number of respondents: 1,195 (total).\n    Frequency of response: On occasion, quarterly, and annually.\n    Total estimated burden: 1,760,519 hours (per year). Burden is \ndefined at 5 CFR 1320.03(b).\n    Total estimated cost: $286,211,330 (per year), which includes \n$123,208,182 annualized capital or operation & maintenance costs.\n    Changes in the estimates: There is a decrease of 65,614 hours in \nthe total estimated respondent burden compared with the ICR currently \napproved by OMB. This decrease is due to source retirements, which have \nboth reduced the estimated overall number of affected sources and \nshifted the estimated mix of monitoring methodologies used. The other \nfactors contributing to the decrease in burden are reductions in the \nestimated numbers of allowance transfer and deduction submissions, and \nallowance auction bids.\n\nCourtney Kerwin,\nDirector, Information Engagement Division.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09386 Filed 5-23-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6560-50-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Annual Burden\n\n    Respondents/Recordkeepers: 4,702.\n    Total Annual Responses: 9,433,560.\n    Total Burden Hours: 4,662,001 (2,405,041 reporting hours + \n2,256,960 recordkeeping hours).\n\nD. Public Comment\n\n    A 60-day notice was published in the Federal Register at 90 FR \n11970, on March 13, 2025. A comment was received; however, it did not \nchange the estimate of the burden.\n    Comment: The proposed collection should be reviewed in the same \ntimeline of other agencies. The accuracy of the government property and \nreporting of the details and information of the case is crucial for \nrecord keeping purposes. Reports should be generated within each agency \nfor analysis, perhaps with a certain threshold indicator on a \ncontinuous basis to determine significant changes in cost, to determine \nif the cost is valid or in need of revision to correct original \ndocuments.\n    Response: Consistent with the comment, agencies manage Government \nproperty closely. This is a request to the Office of Management and \nBudget to extend the clearance of a previously approved information \ncollection requirement regarding Government property. There are no \nprogram changes. The FAR requirements remain the same.\n    Obtaining Copies: Requesters may obtain a copy of the information \ncollection documents from the GSA Regulatory Secretariat Division by \ncalling 202-501-4755 or emailing <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aaedf9ebf8cfcdf9cfc9eacdd9cb84cdc5dc\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"2d6a7e6c7f484a7e484e6d4a5e4c034a425b\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

OMB Control Number, Title, and Any Associated Form(s)\n\n    9000-0073, Certain Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 32 \nRequirements.\n\nB. Need and Uses\n\n    This justification supports the extension of OMB Control No. 9000-\n0073. This clearance covers the information that offerors and \ncontractors must submit to comply with the following FAR requirements:\n    FAR 32.408, Application for advance payments. The authorities \nbehind advance payments are 41 U.S.C. chapter 45; 10 U.S.C. chapter \n277; Public Law 85-804 (50 U.S.C. 1431-1435); and Executive Order \n10789, November 14, 1958. In accordance with FAR 32.408(b), contractors \nrequesting advance payments must submit their request in writing to the \ncontracting officer and provide the following information:\n    <bullet> A reference to the contract if the request concerns an \nexisting contract, or a reference to the solicitation if the request \nconcerns a proposed contract.\n    <bullet> A cash flow forecast showing estimated disbursements and \nreceipts for the period of contract performance.\n    <bullet> The proposed total amount of advance payments.\n    <bullet> The name and address of the financial institution at which \nthe contractor expects to establish a special account as depository for \nthe advance payments.\n    <bullet> A description of the contractor's efforts to obtain \nunguaranteed private financing or a V-loan under eligible contracts.\n    <bullet> Other information appropriate to an understanding of\n    <bullet> the contractor's financial condition and need,\n    <bullet> the contractor's ability to perform the contract without \nloss to the Government, and\n    <bullet> financial safeguards needed to protect the Government's \ninterest.\n    The information is used to determine if advance payments should be \nprovided to the contractor. If advance payments are authorized, the \ninformation is used to ensure proper procedures are followed to protect \nthe Government's interest.\n    FAR 52.232-1 through 52.232-4, 52.232-6, 52.232-7, and 52.232-10--\nPayments. The basic authority for the contract financing that is \nimplemented in these clauses is contained in 41 U.S.C. chapter 45, \nContract Financing, 10 U.S.C. chapter 277, and title III of the Defense \nProduction Act of l950 (50 U.S.C. app. 2091). The following FAR clauses \nrequire the contractor to (as appropriate to the payment terms \nspecified in the contract) provide a proper invoice or voucher.\n    <bullet> 52.232-1, Payments.\n    <bullet> 52.232-2, Payments under Fixed-Price Research and \nDevelopment Contracts.\n    <bullet> 52.232-3, Payments under Personal Services Contracts.\n    <bullet> 52.232-4, Payments under Transportation Contracts and \nTransportation-Related Services Contracts.\n    <bullet> 52.232-6, Payment under Communication Service Contracts \nwith Common Carriers.\n    <bullet> 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour \nContracts.\n    <bullet> 52.232-10, Payments under Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer \nContracts.\n    ``Proper invoice'' is defined in FAR part 2 as an invoice that \nmeets the minimum standards specified in FAR 32.905(b), which include \nthe following items:\n    <bullet> Name and address of the contractor.\n    <bullet> Invoice date and invoice number.\n    <bullet> Contract number or other authorization for supplies \ndelivered or services performed (including order number and line item \nnumber).\n    <bullet> Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and \nextended price of supplies delivered or services performed.\n    <bullet> Shipping and payment terms.\n    <bullet> Name and address of contractor official to whom payment is \nto be sent.\n    <bullet> Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing \naddress of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice.\n    <bullet> Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) if required by agency \nprocedures.\n    <bullet> Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information if \nrequired by agency procedures.\n    <bullet> Any other information or documentation required by the \ncontract (e.g., evidence of shipment).\n    The information is used to determine the proper amount of payments \nto Federal contractors.\n    FAR 52.232-5, Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts. \nThis clause requires the contractor's request for progress payments to \ninclude the following substantiation:\n    <bullet> An itemization of the amounts requested, related to the \nvarious elements of work required by the contract covered by the \npayment requested.\n    <bullet> A listing of the amount included for work performed by \neach subcontractor under the contract.\n    <bullet> A listing of the total amount of each subcontract under \nthe contract.\n    <bullet> A listing of the amounts previously paid to each such \nsubcontractor under the contract.\n    <bullet> Additional supporting data in a form and detail required \nby the contracting officer.\n    Paragraph (c) of FAR clause 52.232-5 requires contractors to \nprovide a certification with each request for progress payment \ncertifying that--\n    <bullet> The amounts requested are only for performance in \naccordance with the specifications, terms, and conditions of the \ncontract;\n    <bullet> All payments due to subcontractors and suppliers from \nprevious payments received under the contract have been made, and \ntimely payments will be made from the proceeds of the payment covered \nby the certification;\n    <bullet> The request for progress payment does not include any \namounts which the prime contractor intends to withhold or retain from a \nsubcontractor or supplier in accordance with the terms and conditions \nof the subcontract; and\n    <bullet> The certification is not to be construed as final \nacceptance of a subcontractor's performance.\n    Paragraph (d) of FAR clause 52.232-5 requires contractors to notify \ncontracting officers, if the contractor, after making a certified \nrequest for progress payments, discovers that a portion or all of the \nrequest constitutes a payment for performance by the contractor that \nfails to conform to the specifications, terms, and conditions of the \ncontract. Contractors must notify the contracting officer that the \nperformance deficiency has been corrected.\n    The information is used to determine the proper amount of payments \nto Federal contractors for construction contracts.\n    FAR 52.232-12, Advance Payments. For authority behind this clause, \nsee the authority for advance payments cited in the narrative above for \nFAR 32.408. If advance payments are authorized, this clause requires \ncontractors to submit the following:\n    <bullet> Per paragraph (g)--The financial institution agreement, in \nthe form prescribed by the administering office, establishing the \nspecial account, and clearly setting forth the special character of the \naccount and the responsibilities of the financial institution under the \naccount.\n    <bullet> Per paragraph (i)(3)--Notification of a lien in favor of \nthe Government to a third person receiving any items or materials on \nwhich the Government has a lien, and a receipt from that third person \nacknowledging the existence of the lien. Contractors are also required \nto provide a copy of each receipt to the contracting officer.\n\n[[Page 22293]]\n\n    <bullet> Per paragraph (m)--(1) Monthly, signed or certified \nbalance sheets and profit and loss statements together with a report on \nthe operation of the special account in the form prescribed by the \nadministering office; and (2) If requested, other information \nconcerning the operation of the contractor's business. (This same \nrequirement is at paragraph (j) of the clause with its Alternate V.)\n    If advance payments are authorized, the information is used to \nensure proper procedures are followed to protect the Government's \ninterest.\n    FAR 52.232-20 and 52.232-22--Limitation of Costs or Funds. FAR \nclause 52.232-20, Limitation of Cost, requires the contractor to notify \nthe contracting officer in writing whenever it has reason to believe \nthat--\n    <bullet> The costs the contractors expect to incur under the \ncontract in the next 60 days, when added to all costs previously \nincurred, will exceed 75 percent of the estimated cost of the \ncontracts; or\n    <bullet> The total cost for the performance of the contract will be \ngreater or substantially less than estimated.\n    As part of the notification, the contractor must provide a revised \nestimate of the total cost of performing the contract.\n    FAR clause 52.232-22, Limitation of Funds, requires the contractor \nto notify the contracting officer in writing whenever it has reason to \nbelieve that the costs it expects to incur under the contract in the \nnext 60 days, when added to all costs previously incurred, will exceed \n75 percent of (1) the total amount so far allotted to the contract by \nthe Government or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the amount \nthen allotted to the contract by the Government plus the contractor's \ncorresponding share. The notice must state the estimated amount of \nadditional funds required to continue performance for the contract \nperiod. Sixty days before the end of the contract period, the \ncontractor must notify the contracting officer in writing of the \nestimated amount of additional funds, if any, required to continue \nperformance under the contract, and when the funds will be required.\n    The information is used to avoid cost overruns and to ensure that \nfunding is available to complete work under Federal contracts.\n    FAR 52.232-27, Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts. The \nauthority for this FAR clause are the OMB prompt payment regulations at \n5 CFR part 1315, which in turn implements the Prompt Payment statute. \nParagraph (a)(6)(ii) of FAR clause 52.232-27 requires contractors \nmaking a written demand to the designated payment office for additional \npenalty payment to support their demand with the following data:\n    <bullet> Specifically assert that late payment interest is due \nunder a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late \npayment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be \nrequired;\n    <bullet> Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late \npayment interest was due; and\n    <bullet> State that payment of the principal has been received, \nincluding the date of receipt.\n    Paragraph (e)(5) of FAR clause 52.232-27 requires contractors to \nnotify contracting officers upon--\n    <bullet> Reduction of the amount of any subsequent certified \napplication for payment; or\n    <bullet> Payment to the subcontractor of any withheld amounts of a \nprogress payment, specifying: the amounts withheld; and the dates that \nthe withholding began and ended.\n    Paragraph (g) of FAR clause 52.232-27 requires contractors to issue \na written notice of any withholding to a subcontractor (with copy to \nthe contracting officer), specifying--\n    <bullet> The amount to be withheld;\n    <bullet> The specific causes for the withholding under the terms of \nthe subcontract; and\n    <bullet> The remedial actions to be taken by the subcontractor in \norder to receive payment of the amounts withheld.\n    Paragraph (l) of FAR clause 52.232-27 requires contractors to remit \noverpayments to the payment office cited in the contract along with a \ndescription that includes the following:\n    <bullet> Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, \nerroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);\n    <bullet> Affected contract number and delivery order number if \napplicable;\n    <bullet> Affected line item or subline item, if applicable; and\n    <bullet> Contractor point of contact.\n    Contractors are required to provide a copy of the remittance and \nsupporting documentation to the contracting officer.\n    The information is used to understand when the contractor withholds \namounts from subcontractors and suppliers after the Government has \nalready paid the contractor the amounts withheld.\n    FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--System for \nAward Management. FAR clause 52.232-33 requires contractors to provide \nupdated EFT information in the System for Award Management (SAM) if \ntheir information changes. According to the SAM Entity Registration \nChecklist, the registration/renewal process asks entities to provide \nthe account type, routing number, and account number for EFT. The \nburden associated with this clause is reflected under OMB Control \nNumber 9000-0189, Certain Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 4 \nRequirements. OMB Control Number 9000-0189 accounts for new \nregistrations and renewals in SAM, which includes providing EFT \ninformation as part of the registration and renewal process.\n    FAR 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other than \nSystem for Award Management. This clause requires contractors to \nprovide the following information to enable the Government to make \npayments under the contract by EFT:\n    <bullet> The contract number (or other procurement identification \nnumber).\n    <bullet> The contractor's name and remittance address.\n    <bullet> The signature, title, and telephone number of the \ncontractor official authorized to provide this information.\n    <bullet> The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of \nthe contractor's financial agent.\n    <bullet> The contractor's account number and the type of account.\n    <bullet> If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic \nabbreviation of the contractor's financial agent.\n    <bullet> If applicable, the contractor must provide the name, \naddress, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number \nof the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer \npayment if the contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to \nthe Fedwire Transfer System.\n    31 U.S.C.3332 requires, subject to implementing regulations of the \nSecretary of the Treasury at 31 CFR part 208, that EFT be used to make \nall contract payments.\n    The information is used to enable the Government to make contract \npayments by EFT.\n\nC. Annual Burden\n\n    Respondents: 273,518.\n    Total Annual Responses: 1,789,889.\n    Total Burden Hours: 462,859.\n\nD. Public Comment\n\n    A 60-day notice was published in the Federal Register at 90 FR \n11979, on March 13, 2025. One comment was received; however, it did not \nchange the estimate of the burden.\n    Comment: Respondent sought restoration or reinstatement of FAR \nclause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, after seeing \nreports on social media of a GSA memo which deleted the clause in \nfederal contracts.\n\n[[Page 22294]]\n\n    Response: This comment is outside the scope of this information \ncollection. FAR clause 52.222-21 is not covered under this information \ncollection; nor are FAR clauses deleted or restored through the process \nof extending previously approved information collection requirements.\n    Obtaining Copies: Requesters may obtain a copy of the information \ncollection documents from the GSA Regulatory Secretariat Division by \ncalling 202-501-4755 or emailing <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#02455143506765516761426571632c656d74\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"03445042516664506660436470622d646c75\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

OMB Control Number, Title, and Any Associated Form(s)\n\n    9000-0027, Value Engineering Requirements.\n\nB. Need and Uses\n\n    This clearance covers the information that contractors must submit \nto comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \nrequirements:\n    <bullet> FAR 52.248-1, Value Engineering; 52.248-2, Value \nEngineering-Architect-Engineer; and 52.248-3, Value Engineering-\nConstruction. These clauses require contractors submitting Value \nEngineering Change Proposals (VECP's) to the Government to provide such \ndetails as: a description of the differences between the existing \ncontract requirement and the proposed requirement, and the comparative \nadvantages and disadvantages of each; a list and analysis of contract \nrequirements that must be changed if the VECP is accepted; a detailed \ncost estimate showing anticipated reductions associated with the VECP; \na statement of the time a modification accepting the VECP must be \nissued to achieve maximum cost reduction, and the effect on contract \ncompletion time; and identification of any previous submissions of the \nVECP; the agencies and contract numbers involved and previous \nGovernment actions, if known.\n    The Government will use the collected information to evaluate the \nVECP and, if accepted, to arrange for an equitable sharing plan.\n\nC. Annual Burden\n\n    Respondents: 90.\n    Total Annual Responses: 180.\n    Total Burden Hours: 2,700.\n\nD. Public Comment\n\n    A 60-day notice was published in the Federal Register at 90 FR \n11975, on March 13, 2025. A comment was received; however, it did not \nchange the estimate of the burden.\n    Comment: This collection should be modified to remove the automated \ncollection techniques that are not currently approved within the \ncontract properly. The incentive language should be removed from the \nexisting agreement and contract regulations need to be followed by all \nparties involved in the agreement.\n    Response: The respondents' input is appreciated. Any changes to the \ncollection will require rulemaking. The clauses at FAR 52.248-1, \n52.248-2, and 52.248-3 require contractors submitting Value Engineering \nChange Proposals (VECP's) to provide enough details for the Government \nto evaluate the VECP and, if accepted, arrange for an equitable sharing \nplan.\n    Obtaining Copies: Requesters may obtain a copy of the information \ncollection documents from the GSA Regulatory Secretariat Division by \ncalling 202-501-4755 or emailing <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#30776371625557635553705743511e575f46\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f8bfabb9aa9d9fab9d9bb89f8b99d69f978e\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

OMB Control Number, Title, and Any Associated Form(s):\n\n    9000-0152, Service Contracting.\n\nB. Need and Uses\n\n    This clearance covers the information that offerors must submit to \ncomply with the FAR requirements at FAR 52.237-10, Identification of \nUncompensated Overtime. This provision requires offerors, when \nprofessional or technical services are acquired on the basis of the \nnumber of hours to be provided, to identify uncompensated overtime \nhours in excess of 40 hours per week, whether at the prime or \nsubcontract level. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are \nin indirect cost pools for personnel whose regular hours are normally \ncharged direct.\n    The contracting officer will use the collected information to \nperform an adequate cost realism analysis of the offerors' proposed \nlabor rates. Proposals which include unrealistically low labor rates, \nor which do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism, will be considered \nby the contracting officer in a risk assessment and evaluated \nappropriately. The primary purpose for obtaining the information and \nusing it during the source selection process is to discourage the use \nof uncompensated overtime.\n\nC. Annual Burden\n\n    Respondents: 20,076.\n    Total Annual Responses: 20,076.\n    Total Burden Hours: 10,038.\n\nD. Public Comment\n\n    A 60-day notice was published in the Federal Register at 90 FR \n11974, on March 13, 2025. A comment was received; however, it did not \nchange the estimate of the burden.\n    Comment: This collection is in need of changes to improve efforts \nto avoid duplication of personnel service hours charged and possible \novercharge of hours worked that are not part of the original agreement. \nThis would be a significant cost savings measure for the Government.\n    Response: The respondents' input is appreciated. Any changes to the \ncollection will require rulemaking. The solicitation provision at FAR \n52.237-10 requires offerors to identify uncompensated overtime hours in \nexcess of 40 hours per week in their offers. The contracting officer \nwill use the collected information to perform an adequate cost realism \nanalysis of the offerors' proposed labor rates.\n    Obtaining Copies: Requesters may obtain a copy of the information \ncollection documents from the GSA Regulatory Secretariat Division by \ncalling 202-501-4755 or emailing <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#da9d899b88bfbd89bfb99abda9bbf4bdb5ac\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"c681958794a3a195a3a586a1b5a7e8a1a9b0\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to adopt fees for \nDedicated Cores.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange initially adopted pricing for Dedicated Cores \non May 6, 2024 (SR-CboeBYX-2024-014). On July 1, 2024, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBYX-2024-024. On August 1, \n2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBYX-\n2024-028. On business date September 30, 2024, the Exchange withdrew \nthat filing and submitted SR-CboeBYX-2024-036. On November 26, 2024, \nthe Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBYX-2024-043 \nand subsequently withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBYX-2024-\n044. On November 27, 2024, the Exchange withdraw that filing and \nsubmitted SR-CboeBYX-2024-045. On December 4, 2024, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBYX-2024-047. On January \n24, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-\nCboeBYX-2025-001. On March 13, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeBYX-2025-005. On May 7, 2025, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, the Exchange recently began to allow Users \n\\4\\ to assign a Single Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') logical order entry \nport \\5\\ to a single dedicated Central Processing Unit (CPU Core) \n(``Dedicated Core''). Historically, CPU Cores had been shared by \nlogical order entry ports (i.e., multiple logical ports from multiple \nfirms may connect to a single CPU Core). Use of Dedicated Cores \nhowever, can provide reduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved \nperformance since a firm using a Dedicated Core is utilizing the full \nprocessing power of a CPU Core instead of sharing that power with other \nfirms. This offering is completely voluntary and is available to all \nUsers that wish to purchase Dedicated Cores. Users may utilize BOE \nlogical order entry ports on shared CPU Cores, either in lieu of, or in \naddition to, their use of Dedicated Core(s). As such, Users are able to \noperate across a mix of shared and dedicated CPU Cores which the \nExchange believes provides additional risk and capacity management. \nFurther, Dedicated Cores are not required nor necessary to participate \non the Exchange and as such Users may opt not to use Dedicated Cores at \nall.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ A User may be either a Member or Sponsored Participant. The \nterm ``Member'' shall mean any registered broker or dealer that has \nbeen admitted to membership in the Exchange, limited liability \ncompany or other organization which is a registered broker or dealer \npursuant to Section 15 of the Act, and which has been approved by \nthe Exchange. A Sponsored Participant may be a Member or non-Member \nof the Exchange whose direct electronic access to the Exchange is \nauthorized by a Sponsoring Member subject to certain conditions. See \nExchange Rule 11.3.\n    \\5\\ Users may currently connect to the Exchange using a logical \nport available through an application programming interface \n(``API''), such as the Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') protocol. A BOE \nlogical order entry port is used for order entry.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to assess the following monthly fees for \nUsers that wish to use Dedicated Cores and adopt a maximum limit. \nFirst, the Exchange proposes to provide up to two Dedicated Cores to \nall Users who wish to use Dedicated Cores, at no additional cost. In \nthe event that a User voluntarily chooses to use more than two \nDedicated Cores, only then would the Exchange assess the following \nfees: $650 per Dedicated Core for 3-10 Dedicated Cores; $850 per \nDedicated Core for 11-15 Dedicated Cores; and $1,050 per Dedicated Core \nfor 16 or more Dedicated Cores. The proposed fees are progressive and \nthe Exchange proposes to include the following example in the Fees \nSchedule to provide clarity as to how the fees will be applied. \nParticularly, the Exchange will provide the following example: if a \nUser were to purchase 11 Dedicated Cores, it will be charged a total of \n$6,050 per month ($0 * 2) + ($650 * 8) + ($850 * 1). The Exchange also \nproposes to make clear in the Fees Schedule that the monthly fees are \nassessed and applied in their entirety and are not prorated. The \nExchange notes the current standard fees assessed for BOE Logical \nPorts, whether used with Dedicated or shared CPU cores, will remain \napplicable and unchanged.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ The Exchange currently assesses $550 per port per month. \nPort fees will also continue to be assessed on the first two \nDedicated Cores that Users receive at no additional cost. See Cboe \nBYX Equities Fee Schedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Since the Exchange currently has a finite amount of physical space \nin its data centers in which its servers (and therefore corresponding \nCPU Cores) are located, the Exchange also proposes to prescribe a \nmaximum limit on the number of Dedicated Cores that Users may purchase \neach month. The purpose of establishing these limits is to manage the \nallotment of Dedicated Cores in a fair manner and to prevent the \nExchange from being required to expend large amounts of limited \nresources in order to provide an unlimited number of Dedicated Cores. \nThe Exchange previously established a limit for Members of a maximum \nnumber of 60 Dedicated Cores and Sponsoring Members a limit of a \nmaximum number of 25 Dedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access \nrelationships.\\7\\ The Exchange has since been able to procure \nadditional servers with CPU Cores and also has a better understanding \nof User demand relative to its available space since the initial launch \nof Dedicated Cores. After seeing increased User demand, the Exchange \nproposed to increase that cap and provided that Members will be limited \nto a maximum number of 80 Dedicated Cores and Sponsoring Members will \nbe limited to a maximum number of 35 Dedicated Cores for each of their \nSponsored Access relationships.\\8\\ The Exchange noted at that time that \nit would continue monitoring Dedicated Core interest by all Users and \nallotment availability with the goal of increasing these limits to meet \nUsers' needs if and when the demand is there and/or the Exchange is \nable to accommodate additional Dedicated Cores. Since then, the \nExchange has determined that it is able to accommodate an increased cap \nrelative to current demand. As such, the Exchange proposed to increase \nthe cap to 120 Dedicated Cores for Members, effective December 1, \n2024.\\9\\ Sponsoring Members will continue to be limited to a maximum of \n35 Dedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access \nrelationships.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100476 (July 9, \n2024), 89 FR 57482 (July 15, 2024) (SR-CboeBYX-2024-024).\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101303 (October 10, \n2024), 89 FR 83740 (October 17, 2024) (SR-CboeBYX-2024-036).\n    \\9\\ The prescribed maximum quantity of Dedicated Cores for \nMembers applies regardless of whether that Member purchases the \nDedicated Cores directly from the Exchange and/or through a Service \nBureau. In a Service Bureau relationship, a customer allows its MPID \nto be used on the ports of a technology provider, or Service Bureau. \nOne MPID may be allowed on several different Service Bureaus.\n    \\10\\ The fee tier(s) applicable to Sponsoring Members are \ndetermined on a per Sponsored Access relationship basis and not on \nthe combined total of Dedicated Cores across Sponsored Users. For \nexample, under the proposed changes, a Sponsoring Member that has \nthree Sponsored Access relationships is entitled to a total of 105 \nDedicated Cores for those 3 Sponsored Access relationships but would \nbe assessed fees separately based on the 35 Dedicated Cores for each \nSponsored User (instead of combined total of 105 Dedicated Cores). \nFor example, a Sponsoring Member with 3 Sponsored Access \nrelationships would pay $30,450 per month if each Sponsored Access \nrelationship purchased the maximum 35 Dedicated Cores. More \nspecifically, the Sponsoring Member would be provided 2 Dedicated \nCores at no additional cost for each Sponsored User under Tier 1 \n(total of 6 Dedicated Cores at no additional cost) and provided an \nadditional 8 Dedicated Cores at $650 each for each Sponsored User, 5 \nDedicated Cores at $850 each for each Sponsored User and 20 \nDedicated Cores at $1,050 each for each Sponsored User (combined \ntotal of 99 additional Dedicated Cores).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22331]]\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\11\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\12\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\13\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) \\14\\ of the Act, which \nrequires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of \nreasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other \npersons using its facilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\12\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\13\\ Id.\n    \\14\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes the proposal is reasonable because the \nExchange is offering all Users who voluntarily choose to utilize \nDedicated Cores up to two Dedicated Cores at no additional cost. \nNotably, of the Members that currently maintain Dedicated Cores, 43% \nmaintain only 1 or 2 Dedicated Cores and therefore pay no additional \nfees. The Exchange believes the proposed fees are reasonable because \nDedicated Cores provide a valuable service in that it can provide \nreduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved performance compared \nto use of a shared CPU Core since a firm using a Dedicated Core is \nutilizing the full processing power of a CPU Core. The Exchange also \nemphasizes however, that the use of Dedicated Cores is not necessary \nfor trading and as noted above, is entirely optional. Users can also \ncontinue to access the Exchange through shared CPU Cores at no \nadditional cost. Indeed, only 35% of the Exchange's Members currently \nuse Dedicated Cores and as noted above, of those who do, only 43% take \nonly 1 or 2 Dedicated Cores at no additional cost. Depending on a \nfirm's specific business needs, the proposal enables Users to choose to \nuse Dedicated Cores in lieu of, or in addition to, shared CPU Cores (or \nas emphasized, not use Dedicated Cores at all). If a User finds little \nbenefit in having Dedicated Cores based on its business model and \ntrading strategies, or determines Dedicated Cores are not cost-\nefficient for its needs or does not provide sufficient value to the \nfirm, such User may continue its use of the shared CPU Cores, \nunchanged. The Exchange is not aware of any specific reason \n(operational or otherwise) why a firm would not partake in the use of \nthe one to two free Dedicated Cores the Exchange offers. Indeed the \nExchange does not believe that the set up a firm would undertake to use \nfree Dedicated Cores offered by the Exchange is prohibitively difficult \nor burdensome; ultimately, whether or not a firm avails itself of the \nfree Dedicated Cores is a business decision, and some firms may decide \nthat the impact that Dedicated Cores may have is simply not beneficial \nor necessary to how that firm operates. The Exchange also has no plans \nto eliminate shared CPU Cores nor to require Users to purchase \nDedicated Cores.\n    The Exchange has seen general interest in Dedicated Cores from a \nvariety of market participants, with varying size and business models. \nSuch market participants include proprietary trading firms (who tend to \nbe more latency sensitive), as well as sell-side market participants \nand buy-side market participants (who tend to be less latency \nsensitive). For background, proprietary trading firms utilize their own \ncapital to trade without taking outside money from clients. Due to the \nnature of their respective businesses, the Exchange has classified \nproprietary trading firms as latency sensitive, and other groups, such \nas buy-side hedge funds, sell-side banks and sell-side non-banks (such \nas agency brokers) as non-latency sensitive. Proprietary trading firms' \nstrategies may range from, market making, to relative value trading and \narbitrage- these all rely on profiting from general market activity \nand, generally, requires faster entry and exit into trades and \npositions making proprietary trading firms more latency sensitive than \nother market segments. Buy-side hedge funds, banks and agency brokers \nare not as latency sensitive as generally the strategy for hedge funds \nis based on overall long-term positioning in the market, and banks and \nagency brokers may profit from commissions of customer order flow; both \nare generally strategies that are not reliant on speed to the same \nextent proprietary trading firms are. Further, Users have various \nreasons for obtaining Dedicated Cores. Some Users for example, may be \nseeking to further reduce latency or increase execution determinism, \nwhereas others may use Dedicated Cores as a general risk mitigation by \nsiloing their respective activity. For example, by using the Dedicated \nCore(s) to silo its respective activity, a firm may be able to mitigate \nrisk during periods of heightened volatility as the firm will not need \nto compete for a shared resource (i.e., the shared core). Of further \nnote, only 64% of Members that are propriety trading firms (who again, \ngenerally tend to be more latency sensitive) utilize Dedicated Cores, \nand of that 64%, 43% are only utilizing the 1 to 2 free Dedicated Cores \navailable to all Users. As mentioned above, some non-latency sensitive \nfirms have chosen to also adopt Dedicated Cores. 19% of Members that \nare not latency sensitive utilize Dedicated Cores, and of that 19%, 38% \nare only utilizing the 1 to 2 free Dedicated Cores available to all \nUsers.\n    The lack of universal, or even widespread, adoption by all such \nusers therefore demonstrates that purchasing Dedicated Cores is not \neffectively a requirement to compete for any one type of market \nparticipant, including latency sensitive market participants. Instead, \nDedicated Cores are an optional and voluntary connectivity offering, \nwhich market participants are free to choose whether or not to utilize \nbased on whether they meet their unique business needs. Moreover, the \nExchange has received overwhelming positive feedback and support for \nDedicated Cores from the firms that have chosen to utilize these in \nfurtherance of their respective needs, with some Users even noting that \nthey have moved more of their order flow to the Exchange and its\n\n[[Page 22332]]\n\naffiliated equities exchanges (the ``Equities Exchanges'') as they have \nnoticed both better fills and greater consistency of order execution at \nthe Equities Exchanges. This demonstrates that despite any incurred \ncosts for Users that choose to purchase Dedicated Cores, it is \nultimately a net win for them as they benefit from better execution. \nThe Exchange believes it also demonstrates that Users find the proposed \nfees to be both reasonable and have benefited from purchasing or, are \nalternatively benefiting from the proposed one or two free Dedicated \nCores available at no additional cost. The Exchange believes this is \nshown by both the level of demand for Dedicated Cores and the feedback \nfrom market participants that have used the Dedicated Cores for its \nunique business needs, including as described above. The Exchange also \nbelieves it's notable that no negative comment letters in connection \nwith the proposed pricing have been received since the Exchange first \nfiled proposed fees for Dedicated Cores back on May 6, 2024. \nAdditionally, as noted earlier, Users can (and many have) decide that \nutilizing even a free Dedicated Core is not needed for their business. \nThe Exchange also notes it has not received any feedback for Users that \nraise concerns over the barrier to entry to use Dedicated Cores, \nincluding notably the free Dedicated Cores- nor is the Exchange aware \nof any reason why a firm would ultimately choose not to use the free \nDedicated Cores, other than it is not necessary for its business. \nUltimately, this is a business decision that each User must make and is \nbest suited to determine and will ultimately depend on the priorities \nand strategies of that User's respective business needs.\n    The Exchange also notes that at least one other exchange also has a \ncomparable offering.\\15\\ The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (``Nasdaq''), \nintroduced the Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure in 2014 \\16\\ which \nallows a member firm to assign up to 30 of its OUCH ports to a \ndedicated server infrastructure for its exclusive use.\\17\\ The \nDedicated OUCH server handles only the subscribing member firm's \nmessage traffic sent through their ports on the Dedicated OUCH to \nNasdaq's system.\\18\\ Similarly, as previously described, a Dedicated \nCore only handles that subscribing firm's messaging activity. Nasdaq \nnotes that with its Dedicated OUCH offering, member firms can develop a \ntailored solution by controlling their message traffic in order to \noptimize their trading strategies.\\19\\ As described above with \nDedicated Cores, one of the benefits is greater execution determinism \nas subscribers only need to account for their order flow when using a \nDedicated Core, similar to the existing Nasdaq Dedicated OUCH offering. \nIn addition to using Dedicated Cores and Dedicated OUCH for the purpose \nof greater execution determinism, firms may also use either offering \nfor greater risk mitigation as, with either offering, the subscribing \nfirm only needs to take their specific messaging traffic into account. \nNasdaq notes as well that its Dedicated OUCH offering is wholly \noptional and therefore member firms are not compelled to subscribe and \nthat its offering is pro-competitive as it adds an additional \nconnectivity option available to Nasdaq members.\\20\\ Similar to the \nDedicated OUCH offering, the Exchange has noted that no User is \nrequired to purchase or to use the two free Dedicated Cores offered to \nall Users.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market, Equity 7 Pricing Schedule, \nSection 115(g)(3), Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure.\n    \\16\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 70693 (October 16, \n2013), 78 FR 62761 (October 22, 2013) (SR-NASDAQ-2013-131).\n    \\17\\ See supra note 15.\n    \\18\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 70036 (July 25, \n2013), 78 FR 45993 (July 30, 2013) (SR-NASDAQ-2013-097).\n    \\19\\ Id.\n    \\20\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Despite these similarities, there are some differences. \nSpecifically, with the Nasdaq OUCH offering, a member firm would need \nto purchase an entire server, of which, 30 OUCH ports could be utilized \non the Dedicated OUCH server--a participant may purchase up to four \nDedicated OUCH servers based on its needs.\\21\\ In contrast, the \nExchange's offering allows for a purchase by cores (as opposed to an \nentire server), allowing a participant to more efficiently scale its \nbusiness by purchasing only the number of cores that it needs. \nUltimately, the Exchange's offering is more akin to a service offering \nwhile the Nasdaq offering is more akin to an infrastructure offering \n(and as such, the pricing structure does differ)--both offerings better \nenable a firm to utilize the full processing power of a CPU Core.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ See https://nasdaqtrader.com/\nTrader.aspx?id=OUCH#:~:text=Each%20server%20can%20house%20up%20to%20a\n%20maximum,Nasdaq%20Market%20Sales%20at%20%2B1%20800%20846%200477.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    A Dedicated OUCH Port Infrastructure subscription is available to a \nmember firm for a fee of $5,000 per month, which is in addition to the \nstandard fees assessed for each OUCH port. A one-time installation fee \nof $5,000 is assessed to subscribers for each Dedicated OUCH Port \nServer subscription.\\22\\ In contrast, the Exchange offers 1-2 Dedicated \nCores at no cost, making this widely available to any participant who \nmay find a benefit from using this offering. Additionally, by the \nExchange not charging an installation fee upfront, participants are \nable to try the offering at no cost, by receiving up to two Dedicated \nCores at no cost to the User. The Exchange's model allows for \nwidespread participation by all who wish to use Dedicated Cores--the \nsteep initial cost of Nasdaq's model of spending, at a minimum, $10,000 \nfor the first month requires a heavy investment, which in the case of \nsmaller participants, may not be feasible. In contrast, the Exchange's \nmodel of providing up to two Dedicated Cores at no cost, allows \nparticipants to easily utilize this service if they believe it is \nhelpful for their business needs. Moreover, the Exchange's service \noffering also provides more Users with more modest CPU capacity needs a \nzero-cost option, as well as the ability to buy only as many Dedicated \nCores that they need, whereas Nasdaq's Dedicated OUCH offering requires \na User to buy all cores offered on a single server (even if a firm does \nnot have the corresponding full amount of 30 ports), with no discounted \nor fee waiver for the first two cores, as well as no ability to buy \nfewer cores than necessary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market Rulebook, Equity 7 Pricing \nSchedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Lastly, the Exchange emphasizes that order processing itself is not \naffected by the introduction of Dedicated Cores. No relevant changes \nare intended to the matching engine, which is, and remains, the main \ncomponent of the Exchange's infrastructure being responsible for the \nactual processing of orders. While Users of Dedicated Cores may notice \na latency reduction, this is an inherent byproduct of introducing \nimproved technology.\\23\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ Moreover, there has been a longstanding history of \nexchanges providing enhanced technology where the latency reduction \nthat follows is a natural result. For example, other exchanges may \noffer a variety of co-location services where subscribers of these \nservices may benefit from lower latency based on the specific \noffering they choose based on their business needs. See e.g., The \nNasdaq Stock Market General 8 Connectivity, Section 1 Co-Location \nServices (demonstrating a range of cabinet offerings).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes that the proposed Dedicated Core fees \nare equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because they continue to \nbe assessed uniformly to similarly situated Users in that all Users who\n\n[[Page 22333]]\n\nchoose to purchase Dedicated Cores will be subject to the same proposed \ntiered fee schedule. Moreover, all Users are entitled to up to 2 \nDedicated Cores at no additional cost and as previously discussed, 43% \nof all Members that take Dedicated Cores (including both latency \nsensitive and non-latency sensitive Members) take only 1 or 2 Dedicated \nCores at no additional cost. The Exchange believes the proposed \nascending fee structure is also reasonable, equitable and not unfairly \ndiscriminatory as it is designed so that firms that use a higher \nallotment of the Exchange's finite number of Dedicated Cores pay higher \nrates, rather than placing that burden on market participants that have \nmore modest needs who will have the flexibility of obtaining Dedicated \nCores at lower price points in the lower tiers. As such, the proposed \nfees do not favor certain categories of market participants in a manner \nthat would impose a burden on competition; rather, the ascending fee \nstructure reflects the (finite) resources consumed by the various needs \nof market participants--that is, the lowest Dedicated Core consuming \nUsers pay the least, and highest Dedicated Core consuming Users pay the \nmost. The Exchange believes that such pricing further creates a lower \nbarrier to entry for all Users, making this service widely available to \nall who deem it helpful for their business, including those with more \nmodest needs. Other exchanges similarly assess higher fees to those \nthat consume more Exchange resources.\\24\\ Moreover, those consuming \nmore Dedicated Cores do so if they find a benefit in having higher \nquantities of Dedicated Cores based on their respective business needs. \nThe proposed tier structure is also designed to encourage firms to \nmanage their needs in a fair manner and to prevent the Exchange from \nbeing required to expend large amounts of limited resources in order to \nprovide an additional number of Dedicated Cores or put the Exchange in \na position that it cannot accommodate demand. Moreover, as discussed \nabove and in more detail below, the Exchange cannot currently offer an \nunlimited number of Dedicated Cores due in part to physical space \nconstraints in the third-party data center. The Exchange believes the \nproposed ascending fee structure is therefore another appropriate \nmeans, in conjunction with an established cap, to manage this finite \nresource and ensure the resource is apportioned more fairly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ See e.g., Cboe U.S. Options Fees Schedule, BZX Options, \nOptions Logical Port Fees, Ports with Bulk Quoting Capabilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes it is reasonable to limit the number of \nDedicated Cores Users can purchase because the Exchange has a finite \namount of space in its third-party data centers to accommodate CPU \ncores, including Dedicated Cores. The Exchange must also take into \naccount timing and cost considerations in procuring additional \nDedicated Cores and related hardware such as servers, switches, optics \nand cables, as well as the readiness of the Exchange's data center \nspace to accommodate additional Dedicated Cores in the Exchange's \nrespective Order Handler Cabinets.\\25\\ Moreover, procuring data center \nspace has grown to be more challenging than it was five years ago with \nthe increased demand for data center space. For example, the U.S. \ncolocation data center market has doubled in size in just four years. \nIn addition to the Exchange's rollout of Dedicated Cores, the Exchange \nis mindful of its other business areas and the need to continue to be \nmindful of its existing, external restraints in procuring additional \nspace in this area. The Exchange has, and will continue to, monitor \nmarket participant demand and space availability and endeavor to adjust \nthe limit if and when the Exchange is able to acquire additional space \nand power within the third-party data centers and/or additional CPU \nCores to accommodate additional Dedicated Cores.\\26\\ The Exchange \nmonitors its capacity and data center space and thus is in the best \nplace to determine these limits and modify them as appropriate in \nresponse to changes to this capacity and space, as well as market \ndemand. Indeed, the Exchange has already increased the prescribed \nmaximum since the launch of Dedicated Cores on May 6, 2024 as a result \nof evaluating the demand relative to Dedicated Cores availability and \nproposes to increase the prescribed maximum again due to the Exchange's \ncontinued ability to support current demand relative to current \navailability.\\27\\ As another example, the Exchange's affiliate Cboe \nEDGA Exchange, Inc. has increased the prescribed maximum limit three \ntimes since the launch of Dedicated Cores on its exchange on February \n26, 2024 as a result of evaluating the demand relative to Dedicated \nCores availability.\\28\\ The proposed increased limits continue to apply \nuniformly to similarly situated market participants (i.e., all Members \nare subject to the same limit and all Sponsored Participants are \nsubject to the same limit, respectively). The Exchange believes it's \nnot unfairly discriminatory to provide for different limits for \ndifferent types of Users. For example, the Exchange believes it's not \nunfairly discriminatory to provide for an initial lower limit to be \nallocated for Sponsored Participants because unlike Members, Sponsored \nParticipants are able to access the Exchange without paying a \nMembership Fee. Members also have more regulatory obligations and risk \nthat Sponsored Participants do not. For example, while Sponsored \nParticipants must agree to comply with the Rules of the Exchange, it is \nthe Sponsoring Member of that Sponsored Participant that remains \nultimately responsible for all orders entered on or through the \nExchange by that Sponsored Participant. The industry also has a history \nof applying fees differently to Members as compared to Sponsored \nParticipants.\\29\\ Lastly, the Exchange believes its proposed maximum \nlimits, and distinction between Members and Sponsored Participants, is \nanother appropriate means to help the Exchange manage its allotment of \nDedicated Cores and better ensure this finite resource is apportioned \nfairly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ The Exchange notes that it cannot currently convert shared \nCPU cores into Dedicated Cores.\n    \\26\\ The Exchange does not have any Users that take Dedicated \nCores at or near the maximum limits and the average number of \nDedicated Cores used for the Exchange is 12.\n    \\27\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100476 (July 9, \n2024), 89 FR 57482 (July 15, 2024) (SR-CboeBYX-2024-024).\n    \\28\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99983 (April 17, \n2024), 89 FR 30418 (April 23, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-014) \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 100300 (June 10, 2024), 89 FR \n50653 (June 14, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-020); and Securities \nExchange Act Release No. 100736 (August 21, 2024), 89 FR 67696 \n(August 15, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-032).\n    \\29\\ See e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 68342 \n(December 3, 2012), 77 FR 73096 (December 7, 2012) (SR-CBOE-2012-\n114) and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 66082 (January 3, \n2012), 77 FR 1101 (January 9, 2012) (SR-C2-2011-041).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act because the proposed tiered fee \nstructure will apply equally to all similarly situated Users that \nchoose to use Dedicated Cores. As discussed above, Dedicated Cores are \noptional and Users may choose to utilize Dedicated Cores, or not, based \non their views of the additional benefits and added value provided by \nutilizing a Dedicated Core. The Exchange believes the proposed fee will \nbe assessed proportionately to the potential\n\n[[Page 22334]]\n\nvalue or benefit received by Users with a greater number of Dedicated \nCores and notes that Users may determine at any time to cease using \nDedicated Cores. As discussed, Users can also continue to access the \nExchange through shared CPU Cores at no additional cost. Finally, all \nUsers will be entitled to two Dedicated Cores at no additional cost.\n    Next, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change does not \nimpose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or \nappropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously \ndiscussed, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market, \nincluding competition for exchange memberships. Market Participants \nhave numerous alternative venues that they may participate on, \nincluding 15 other equities exchanges, as well as off-exchange venues, \nwhere competitive products are available for trading. Indeed, \nparticipants can readily choose to submit their order flow to other \nexchange and off-exchange venues if they deem fee levels at those other \nvenues to be more favorable. Further, as described above, Nasdaq also \nalready provides a similar offering.\\30\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market, Equity 7 Pricing Schedule, \nSection 115(g)(3), Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference \nfor competition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, \nproducts, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, in \nRegulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market \nforces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized \nthat current regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably \nsuccessful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that \nare most important to investors and listed companies.'' \\31\\ The fact \nthat this market is competitive has also long been recognized by the \ncourts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. \nCircuit stated as follows: ``[n]o one disputes that competition for \norder flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. \nnational market system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the \nbroker-dealers that act as their order-routing agents, have a wide \nrange of choices of where to route orders for execution'; [and] `no \nexchange can afford to take its market share percentages for granted' \nbecause `no exchange possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in \nthe execution of order flow from broker dealers'. . . .''.\\32\\ \nAccordingly, the Exchange does not believe its proposed change imposes \nany burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\31\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005).\n    \\32\\ NetCoalition v. SEC, 615 F.3d 525, 539 (D.C. Cir. 2010) \n(quoting Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59039 (December 2, \n2008), 73 FR 74770, 74782-83 (December 9, 2008) (SR-NYSEArca-2006-\n21)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\33\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\34\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission will institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or \ndisapproved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\33\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).\n    \\34\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to adopt fees for \nDedicated Cores. The text of the proposed rule change is provided in \nExhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/BZX/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/BZX/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at \nthe Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to adopt fees for \nDedicated Cores.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange initially introduced pricing for Dedicated \nCores on June 10, 2024 (SR-CboeBZX-2024-054). On August 1, 2024, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2024-075. On \nbusiness date September 30, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing \nand submitted SR-CboeBZX-2024-094. On November 26, 2024, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted this SR-CboeBZX-2024-\n122. On January 24, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing and \nsubmitted SR-CboeBZX-2025-009. On March 12, 2025, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2025-041. On May 7, \n2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, the Exchange recently began to allow Users \n\\4\\ to assign a Single Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') logical order entry \nport \\5\\ to a single dedicated Central Processing Unit (CPU Core) \n(``Dedicated Core''). Historically, CPU Cores had been shared by \nlogical order entry ports (i.e., multiple logical ports from multiple \nfirms may connect to a single CPU Core). Use of Dedicated Cores \nhowever, can provide reduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved \nperformance since a firm using a Dedicated Core is utilizing the full \nprocessing power of a CPU Core instead of sharing that power with other \nfirms. This offering is completely voluntary and is available to all \nUsers that wish to purchase Dedicated Cores. Users may utilize BOE \nlogical order entry ports on shared CPU Cores, either in lieu of, or in \naddition to, their use of Dedicated Core(s). As such, Users are able to \noperate across a mix of shared and dedicated CPU Cores which the \nExchange believes provides additional risk and capacity management. \nFurther, Dedicated Cores are not required nor necessary to participate \non the Exchange and as such Users may opt not to use Dedicated Cores at \nall.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ A User may be either a Member or Sponsored Participant. The \nterm ``Member'' shall mean any registered broker or dealer that has \nbeen admitted to membership in the Exchange, limited liability \ncompany or other organization which is a registered broker or dealer \npursuant to Section 15 of the Act, and which has been approved by \nthe Exchange. A Sponsored Participant may be a Member or non-Member \nof the Exchange whose direct electronic access to the Exchange is \nauthorized by a Sponsoring Member subject to certain conditions. See \nExchange Rule 11.3.\n    \\5\\ Users may currently connect to the Exchange using a logical \nport available through an application programming interface \n(``API''), such as the Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') protocol. A BOE \nlogical order entry port is used for order entry.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to assess the following monthly fees for \nUsers that wish to use Dedicated Cores and adopt a maximum limit. \nFirst, the Exchange proposes to provide up to two Dedicated Cores to \nall Users who wish to use Dedicated Cores, at no additional cost. In \nthe event that a User voluntarily chooses to use more than two \nDedicated Cores, only then would the Exchange assess the following \nfees: $650 per Dedicated Core for 3-15 Dedicated Cores; $850 per \nDedicated Core for 16-30 Dedicated Cores; and $1,050 per Dedicated Core \nfor 31 or more Dedicated Cores. The proposed fees are progressive and \nthe Exchange proposes to include the following example in the Fees \nSchedule to provide clarity as to how the fees will be applied. \nParticularly, the Exchange will provide the following example: if a \nUser were to purchase 16 Dedicated Cores, it will be charged a total of \n$9,300 per month ($0 * 2) + ($650 * 13) + ($850 * 1). The Exchange also \nproposes to make clear in the Fees Schedule that the monthly fees are \nassessed and applied in their entirety and are not prorated. The \nExchange notes the current standard fees assessed for BOE Logical \nPorts, whether used with Dedicated or shared CPU cores, will remain \napplicable and unchanged.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ The Exchange currently assesses $550 per port per month. \nPort fees will also continue to be assessed on the first two \nDedicated Cores that Users receive at no additional cost. See Cboe \nBZX Equities Fee Schedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Since the Exchange currently has a finite amount of physical space \nin its data centers in which its servers (and therefore corresponding \nCPU Cores) are located, the Exchange also proposes to prescribe a \nmaximum limit on the number of Dedicated Cores that Users may purchase \neach month. The purpose of establishing these limits is to manage the \nallotment of Dedicated Cores in a fair manner and to prevent the \nExchange from being required to expend large amounts of limited \nresources in order to provide an unlimited number of Dedicated Cores. \nThe Exchange previously established a limit for Members of a maximum \nnumber of 60 Dedicated Cores and Sponsoring Members a limit of a \nmaximum number of 25 Dedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access \nrelationships.\\7\\ The Exchange has since been able to procure \nadditional physical space in its third-party data century as well as \nadditional servers with CPU Cores and also has a better understanding \nof User demand relative to its available space and available Dedicated \nCores since the initial launch of Dedicated Cores. After seeing \nincreased User demand, the Exchange proposed to increase the cap and \nprovided that Members will be limited to a maximum number of 80 \nDedicated Cores and Sponsoring Members will be limited to a maximum \nnumber of 35 Dedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access \nrelationships.\\8\\ The Exchange noted at that time that it would \ncontinue monitoring Dedicated Core interest by all Users and allotment \navailability with the goal of increasing these limits to meet Users' \nneeds if and when the demand is there and/or the Exchange is able to \naccommodate additional Dedicated Cores. Since then, the Exchange has \ndetermined that it is able to accommodate an increased cap relative to \ncurrent demand. As such, the Exchange proposed to increase the cap to \n120 Dedicated Cores for Members, effective December 1, 2024.\\9\\ \nSponsoring\n\n[[Page 22336]]\n\nMembers will continue to be limited to a maximum of 35 Dedicated Cores \nfor each of their Sponsored Access relationships.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100395 (June 21, \n2024), 89 FR 53687 (June 27, 2024) (SR-CboeBZX-2024-054).\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101302 (October 10, \n2024), 89 FR 83727 (October 17, 2024) (SR-CboeBZX-2024-094).\n    \\9\\ The prescribed maximum quantity of Dedicated Cores for \nMembers applies regardless of whether that Member purchases the \nDedicated Cores directly from the Exchange and/or through a Service \nBureau. In a Service Bureau relationship, a customer allows its MPID \nto be used on the ports of a technology provider, or Service Bureau. \nOne MPID may be allowed on several different Service Bureaus.\n    \\10\\ The fee tier(s) applicable to Sponsoring Members are \ndetermined on a per Sponsored Access relationship basis and not on \nthe combined total of Dedicated Cores across Sponsored Users. For \nexample, under the proposed changes, a Sponsoring Member that has \nthree Sponsored Access relationships is entitled to a total of 105 \nDedicated Cores for those 3 Sponsored Access relationships but would \nbe assessed fees separately based on the 35 Dedicated Cores for each \nSponsored User (instead of combined total of 105 Dedicated Cores). \nFor example, a Sponsoring Member with 3 Sponsored Access \nrelationships would pay $30,450 per month if each Sponsored Access \nrelationship purchased the maximum 35 Dedicated Cores. More \nspecifically, the Sponsoring Member would be provided 2 Dedicated \nCores at no additional cost for each Sponsored User under Tier 1 \n(total of 6 Dedicated Cores at no additional cost) and provided an \nadditional 8 Dedicated Cores at $650 each for each Sponsored User, 5 \nDedicated Cores at $850 each for each Sponsored User and 20 \nDedicated Cores at $1,050 each for each Sponsored User (combined \ntotal of 99 additional Dedicated Cores).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\11\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\12\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\13\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) \\14\\ of the Act, which \nrequires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of \nreasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other \npersons using its facilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\12\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\13\\ Id.\n    \\14\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes the proposal is reasonable because the \nExchange is offering all User who voluntarily choose to utilize \nDedicated Cores up to two Dedicated Cores at no additional cost. \nNotably, of the Members that currently maintain Dedicated Cores, 23% \nmaintain only 1 or 2 Dedicated Cores and therefore pay no additional \nfees. The Exchange believes the proposed fees are reasonable because \nDedicated Cores provide a valuable service in that it can provide \nreduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved performance compared \nto use of a shared CPU Core since a firm using a Dedicated Core is \nutilizing the full processing power of a CPU Core. The Exchange also \nemphasizes however, that the use of Dedicated Cores is not necessary \nfor trading and as noted above, is entirely optional. Users can also \ncontinue to access the Exchange through shared CPU Cores at no \nadditional cost. Indeed, only 36% of the Exchange's Members currently \nuse Dedicated Cores and as noted above, of that 36%, only 23% take 1 or \n2 Dedicated Cores at no additional cost. Depending on a firm's specific \nbusiness needs, the proposal enables Users to choose to use Dedicated \nCores in lieu of, or in addition to, shared CPU Cores (or as \nemphasized, not use Dedicated Cores at all). If a User finds little \nbenefit in having Dedicated Cores based on its business model and \ntrading strategies, or determines Dedicated Cores are not cost-\nefficient for its needs or does not provide sufficient value to the \nfirm, such User may continue its use of the shared CPU Cores, \nunchanged. The Exchange is not aware of any specific reason \n(operational or otherwise) why a firm would not partake in the use of \nthe one to two free Dedicated Cores the Exchange offers. Indeed the \nExchange does not believe that the set up a firm would undertake to use \nfree Dedicated Cores offered by the Exchange is prohibitively difficult \nor burdensome; ultimately, whether or not a firm avails itself of the \nfree Dedicated Cores is a business decision, and some firms may decide \nthat the impact that Dedicated Cores may have is simply not beneficial \nor necessary to how that firm operates. The Exchange also has no plans \nto eliminate shared CPU Cores nor to require Users to purchase \nDedicated Cores.\n    The Exchange has seen general interest in Dedicated Cores from a \nvariety of market participants, with varying size and business models. \nSuch market participants include proprietary trading firms (who tend to \nbe more latency sensitive), as well as sell-side market participants \nand buy-side market participants (who tend to be less latency \nsensitive). For background, proprietary trading firms utilize their own \ncapital to trade without taking outside money from clients. Due to the \nnature of their respective businesses, the Exchange has classified \nproprietary trading firms as latency sensitive, and other groups, such \nas buy-side hedge funds, sell-side banks and sell-side non-banks (such \nas agency brokers) as non-latency sensitive. Proprietary trading firms' \nstrategies may range from, market making, to relative value trading and \narbitrage--these all rely on profiting from general market activity \nand, generally, requires faster entry and exit into trades and \npositions making proprietary trading firms more latency sensitive than \nother market segments. Buy-side hedge funds, banks and agency brokers \nare not as latency sensitive as, generally, the strategy for hedge \nfunds is based on overall long-term positioning in the market, and \nbanks and agency brokers may profit from commissions of customer order \nflow; both are generally strategies that are not reliant on speed to \nthe same extent proprietary trading firms are. Further, Users have \nvarious reasons for obtaining Dedicated Cores. Some Users for example, \nmay be seeking to further reduce latency or increase execution \ndeterminism, whereas others may use Dedicated Cores as a general risk \nmitigation by siloing their respective activity. For example, by using \nthe Dedicated Core(s) to silo its respective activity, a firm may be \nable to mitigate risk during periods of heightened volatility as the \nfirm will not need to compete for a shared resource (i.e., the shared \ncore). Of further note, only 64% of Members that are propriety trading \nfirms (who again, generally tend to be more latency sensitive) utilize \nDedicated Cores, and of that 64%, 25% are only utilizing the 1 to 2 \nfree Dedicated Cores available to all Users. As mentioned above, some \nnon-latency sensitive firms have chosen to also adopt Dedicated Cores. \n21% of Members that are not latency sensitive utilize Dedicated Cores, \nand of that 21%, 20% are only utilizing the 1 to 2 free Dedicated Cores \navailable to all Users.\n    The lack of universal, or even widespread, adoption by all such \nusers therefore demonstrates that purchasing Dedicated Cores is not \neffectively a requirement to compete for any one type of market \nparticipant, including latency sensitive market participants. Instead, \nDedicated Cores are an optional and voluntary connectivity offering, \nwhich market participants are free to choose\n\n[[Page 22337]]\n\nwhether or not to utilize based on whether they meet their unique \nbusiness needs. Moreover, the Exchange has received overwhelming \npositive feedback and support for Dedicated Cores from the firms that \nhave chosen to utilize these in furtherance of their respective needs, \nwith some Users even noting that they have moved more of their order \nflow to the Exchange and its affiliated equities exchanges (the \n``Equities Exchanges'') as they have noticed both better fills and \ngreater consistency of order execution at the Equities Exchanges. This \ndemonstrates that despite any incurred costs for Users that choose to \npurchase Dedicated Cores, it is ultimately a net win for them as they \nbenefit from better execution. The Exchange believes it also \ndemonstrates that Users find the proposed fees to be both reasonable \nand have benefited from purchasing or, are alternatively benefiting \nfrom the proposed one or two free Dedicated Cores available at no \nadditional cost. The Exchange believes this is shown by both the level \nof demand for Dedicated Cores and the feedback from market participants \nthat have used the Dedicated Cores for its unique business needs, \nincluding as described above. The Exchange also believes it's notable \nthat no negative comment letters in connection with the proposed \npricing have been received since the Exchange first filed proposed fees \nfor Dedicated Cores back on June 10, 2024. Additionally, as noted \nearlier, Users can (and many have) decide that utilizing even a free \nDedicated Core is not needed for their business. The Exchange also \nnotes it has not received any feedback for Users that raise concerns \nover the barrier to entry to use Dedicated Cores, including notably the \nfree Dedicated Cores--nor is the Exchange aware of any reason why a \nfirm would ultimately choose not to use the free Dedicated Cores, other \nthan it is not necessary for its business. Ultimately, this is a \nbusiness decision that each User must make and is best suited to \ndetermine and will ultimately depend on the priorities and strategies \nof that User's respective business needs.\n    The Exchange also notes that at least one other exchange also has a \ncomparable offering.\\15\\ The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (``Nasdaq''), \nintroduced the Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure in 2014 \\16\\ which \nallows a member firm to assign up to 30 of its OUCH ports to a \ndedicated server infrastructure for its exclusive use.\\17\\ The \nDedicated OUCH server handles only the subscribing member firm's \nmessage traffic sent through their ports on the Dedicated OUCH to \nNasdaq's system.\\18\\ Similarly, as previously described, a Dedicated \nCore only handles that subscribing firm's messaging activity. Nasdaq \nnotes that with its Dedicated OUCH offering, member firms can develop a \ntailored solution by controlling their message traffic in order to \noptimize their trading strategies.\\19\\ As described above with \nDedicated Cores, one of the benefits is greater execution determinism \nas subscribers only need to account for their order flow when using a \nDedicated Core, similar to the existing Nasdaq Dedicated OUCH offering. \nIn addition to using Dedicated Cores and Dedicated OUCH for the purpose \nof greater execution determinism, firms may also use either offering \nfor greater risk mitigation as, with either offering, the subscribing \nfirm only needs to take their specific messaging traffic into account. \nNasdaq notes as well that its Dedicated OUCH offering is wholly \noptional and therefore member firms are not compelled to subscribe and \nthat its offering is pro-competitive as it adds an additional \nconnectivity option available to Nasdaq members.\\20\\ Similar to the \nDedicated OUCH offering, the Exchange has noted that no User is \nrequired to purchase or to use the two free Dedicated Cores offered to \nall Users.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market, Equity 7 Pricing Schedule, \nSection 115(g)(3), Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure.\n    \\16\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 70693 (October 16, \n2013), 78 FR 62761 (October 22, 2013) (SR-NASDAQ-2013-131).\n    \\17\\ See supra note 15.\n    \\18\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 70036 (July 25, \n2013), 78 FR 45993 (July 30, 2013) (SR-NASDAQ-2013-097).\n    \\19\\ Id.\n    \\20\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Despite these similarities, there are some differences. \nSpecifically, with the Nasdaq OUCH offering, a member firm would need \nto purchase an entire server, of which, 30 OUCH ports could be utilized \non the Dedicated OUCH server--a participant may purchase up to four \nDedicated OUCH servers based on its needs.\\21\\ In contrast, the \nExchange's offering allows for a purchase by cores (as opposed to an \nentire server), allowing a participant to more efficiently scale its \nbusiness by purchasing only the number of cores that it needs. \nUltimately, the Exchange's offering is more akin to a service offering \nwhile the Nasdaq offering is more akin to an infrastructure offering \n(and as such, the pricing structure does differ)--both offerings better \nenable a firm to utilize the full processing power of a CPU Core.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ See https://nasdaqtrader.com/\nTrader.aspx?id=OUCH#:~:text=Each%20server%20can%20house%20up%20to%20a\n%20maximum,Nasdaq%20Market%20Sales%20at%20%2B1%20800%20846%200477.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    A Dedicated OUCH Port Infrastructure subscription is available to a \nmember firm for a fee of $5,000 per month, which is in addition to the \nstandard fees assessed for each OUCH port. A one-time installation fee \nof $5,000 is assessed to subscribers for each Dedicated OUCH Port \nServer subscription.\\22\\ In contrast, the Exchange offers 1-2 Dedicated \nCores at no cost, making this widely available to any participant who \nmay find a benefit from using this offering. Additionally, by the \nExchange not charging an installation fee upfront, participants are \nable to try the offering at no cost, by receiving up to two Dedicated \nCores at no cost to the User. The Exchange's model allows for \nwidespread participation by all who wish to use Dedicated Cores--the \nsteep initial cost of Nasdaq's model of spending, at a minimum, $10,000 \nfor the first month requires a heavy investment, which in the case of \nsmaller participants, may not be feasible. In contrast, the Exchange's \nmodel of providing up to two Dedicated Cores at no cost, allows \nparticipants to easily utilize this service if they believe it is \nhelpful for their business needs. Moreover, the Exchange's service \noffering also provides more Users with more modest CPU capacity needs a \nzero-cost option, as well as the ability to buy only as many Dedicated \nCores that they need, whereas Nasdaq's Dedicated OUCH offering requires \na User to buy all cores offered on a single server (even if a firm does \nnot have the corresponding full amount of 30 ports), with no discounted \nor fee waiver for the first two cores, as well as no ability to buy \nfewer cores than necessary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market Rulebook, Equity 7 Pricing \nSchedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Lastly, the Exchange emphasizes that order processing itself is not \naffected by the introduction of Dedicated Cores. No relevant changes \nare intended to the matching engine, which is, and remains, the main \ncomponent of the Exchange's infrastructure being responsible for the \nactual processing of orders. While Users of Dedicated Cores may notice \na latency reduction, this is an inherent byproduct of introducing \nimproved technology.\\23\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ Moreover, there has been a longstanding history of \nexchanges providing enhanced technology where the latency reduction \nthat follows is a natural result. For example, other exchanges may \noffer a variety of co-location services where subscribers of these \nservices may benefit from lower latency based on the specific \noffering they choose based on their business needs. See e.g., The \nNasdaq Stock Market General 8 Connectivity, Section 1 Co-Location \nServices (demonstrating a range of cabinet offerings).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22338]]\n\n    The Exchange also believes that the proposed Dedicated Core fees \nare equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because they continue to \nbe assessed uniformly to similarly situated Users in that all Users who \nchoose to purchase Dedicated Cores will be subject to the same proposed \ntiered fee schedule. Moreover, all Users are entitled to up to 2 \nDedicated Cores at no additional cost and, as previously discussed, 23% \nof all Members that take Dedicated Cores (including both latency \nsensitive and non-latency sensitive Users) take only 1 or 2 Dedicated \nCores at no additional cost. The Exchange believes the proposed \nascending fee structure is also reasonable, equitable and not unfairly \ndiscriminatory as it is designed so that firms that use a higher \nallotment of the Exchange's finite number of Dedicated Cores pay higher \nrates, rather than placing that burden on market participants that have \nmore modest needs who will have the flexibility of obtaining Dedicated \nCores at lower price points in the lower tiers. As such, the proposed \nfees do not favor certain categories of market participants in a manner \nthat would impose a burden on competition; rather, the ascending fee \nstructure reflects the (finite) resources consumed by the various needs \nof market participants--that is, the lowest Dedicated Core consuming \nUsers pay the least, and highest Dedicated Core consuming Users pay the \nmost. The Exchange believes that such pricing further creates a lower \nbarrier to entry for all Users, making this service widely available to \nall who deem it helpful for their business, including those with more \nmodest needs. Other exchanges similarly assess higher fees to those \nthat consume more Exchange resources, including the Exchange on its \noptions platform.\\24\\ Moreover, those consuming more Dedicated Cores do \nso if they find a benefit in having higher quantities of Dedicated \nCores based on their respective business needs. The proposed tier \nstructure is also designed to encourage firms to manage their needs in \na fair manner and to prevent the Exchange from being required to expend \nlarge amounts of limited resources in order to provide an additional \nnumber of Dedicated Cores or put the Exchange in a position that it \ncannot accommodate demand. Moreover, as discussed above and in more \ndetail below, the Exchange cannot currently offer an unlimited number \nof Dedicated Cores due in part to physical space constraints in the \nthird-party data center. The Exchange believes the proposed ascending \nfee structure is therefore another appropriate means, in conjunction \nwith an established cap, to manage this finite resource and ensure the \nresource is apportioned more fairly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ See e.g., Cboe U.S. Options Fee Schedule, BZX Options, \nOptions Logical Port Fees, Ports with Bulk Quoting Capabilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes it is reasonable to limit the number of \nDedicated Cores Users can purchase because the Exchange has a finite \namount of space in its third-party data centers to accommodate CPU \ncores, including Dedicated Cores. The Exchange must also take into \naccount timing and cost considerations in procuring additional \nDedicated Cores and related hardware such as servers, switches, optics \nand cables, as well as the readiness of the Exchange's data center \nspace to accommodate additional Dedicated Cores in the Exchange's \nrespective Order Handler Cabinets.\\25\\ Moreover, procuring data center \nspace has grown to be more challenging than it was five years ago with \nthe increased demand for data center space. For example, the U.S. \ncolocation data center market has doubled in size in just four years. \nIn addition to the Exchange's rollout of Dedicated Cores, the Exchange \nis mindful of its other business areas and the need to continue to be \nmindful of its existing, external restraints in procuring additional \nspace in this area. The Exchange has, and will continue to, monitor \nmarket participant demand and space availability and endeavor to adjust \nthe limit if and when the Exchange is able to acquire additional space \nand power within the third-party data centers and/or additional CPU \nCores to accommodate additional Dedicated Cores.\\26\\ The Exchange \nmonitors its capacity and data center space and thus is in the best \nplace to determine these limits and modify them as appropriate in \nresponse to changes to this capacity and space, as well as market \ndemand. For example, the Exchange's affiliate Cboe EDGA Exchange, Inc. \nhas increased the prescribed maximum limit three times since the launch \nof Dedicated Cores on its exchange on February 26, 2024 as a result of \nevaluating the demand relative to Dedicated Cores availability.\\27\\ The \nproposed increased limits continue to apply uniformly to similarly \nsituated market participants (i.e., all Members are subject to the same \nlimit and all Sponsored Participants are subject to the same limit, \nrespectively). The Exchange believes it's not unfairly discriminatory \nto provide for different limits for different types of Users. For \nexample, the Exchange believes it's not unfairly discriminatory to \nprovide for an initial lower limit to be allocated for Sponsored \nParticipants because unlike Members, Sponsored Participants are able to \naccess the Exchange without paying a Membership Fee. Members also have \nmore regulatory obligations and risk that Sponsored Participants do \nnot. For example, while Sponsored Participants must agree to comply \nwith the Rules of the Exchange, it is the Sponsoring Member of that \nSponsored Participant that remains ultimately responsible for all \norders entered on or through the Exchange by that Sponsored \nParticipant. The industry also has a history of applying fees \ndifferently to Members as compared to Sponsored Participants.\\28\\ \nLastly, the Exchange believes its proposed maximum limits, and \ndistinction between Members and Sponsored Participants, is another \nappropriate means to help the Exchange manage its allotment of \nDedicated Cores and better ensure this finite resource is apportioned \nfairly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ The Exchange notes that it cannot currently convert shared \nCPU cores into Dedicated Cores.\n    \\26\\ The Exchange noted that only User that has Dedicated Cores \nis at or near the maximum limits. The average number of Dedicated \nCores used for the Exchange is 23.\n    \\27\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99983 (April 17, \n2024), 89 FR 30418 (April 23, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-014) \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 100300 (June 10, 2024), 89 FR \n50653 (June 14, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-020); and Securities \nExchange Act Release No. 100736 (August 21, 2024), 89 FR 67696 \n(August 15, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-032).\n    \\28\\ See e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 68342 \n(December 3, 2012), 77 FR 73096 (December 7, 2012) (SR-CBOE-2012-\n114).and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 66082 (January 3, \n2012), 77 FR 1101 (January 9, 2012) (SR-C2-2011-041).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act because the proposed tiered fee \nstructure will apply equally to all similarly situated Users that \nchoose to use Dedicated Cores. As discussed above, Dedicated Cores are \noptional and Users may choose to utilize Dedicated Cores, or not, based \non their views of the additional benefits and added value provided by \nutilizing a Dedicated Core. The Exchange believes the proposed fees \nwill be assessed proportionately to the potential value or benefit \nreceived by Users with a greater number of Dedicated Cores and notes \nthat Users may determine at any time to cease using Dedicated Cores. As \ndiscussed, Users can also continue to\n\n[[Page 22339]]\n\naccess the Exchange through shared CPU Cores at no additional cost. \nFinally, all Users will be entitled to two Dedicated Cores at no \nadditional cost.\n    Next, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change does not \nimpose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or \nappropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously \ndiscussed, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market, \nincluding competition for exchange memberships. Market Participants \nhave numerous alternative venues that they may participate on, \nincluding 15 other equities exchanges, as well as off-exchange venues, \nwhere competitive products are available for trading. Indeed, \nparticipants can readily choose to submit their order flow to other \nexchange and off-exchange venues if they deem fee levels at those other \nvenues to be more favorable. Further, as described above, Nasdaq also \nalready provides a similar offering.\\29\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market, Equity 7 Pricing Schedule, \nSection 115(g)(3), Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference \nfor competition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, \nproducts, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, in \nRegulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market \nforces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized \nthat current regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably \nsuccessful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that \nare most important to investors and listed companies.'' \\30\\ The fact \nthat this market is competitive has also long been recognized by the \ncourts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. \nCircuit stated as follows: ``[n]o one disputes that competition for \norder flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. \nnational market system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the \nbroker-dealers that act as their order-routing agents, have a wide \nrange of choices of where to route orders for execution'; [and] `no \nexchange can afford to take its market share percentages for granted' \nbecause `no exchange possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in \nthe execution of order flow from broker dealers'. . . .''.\\31\\ \nAccordingly, the Exchange does not believe its proposed change imposes \nany burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005).\n    \\31\\ NetCoalition v.

See also \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 100783 (August 20, 2024), 89 FR \n68481 (August 26, 2024) (SR-LTSE-2024-03) (Order Approving a \nProposed Rule Change to Transition to a New Trading Platform and \nAmend its Trading Rules).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange's \nwebsite at <a href=\"https://longtermstockexchange.com/\">https://longtermstockexchange.com/</a>, at the principal office \nof the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, \nset forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant \naspects of such statements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange is proposing to establish a new section (D. Market \nData Fees) in the Long-Term Stock Exchange Fee Schedule for its \nproprietary market data feeds, Depth of Book, Top of Book and Last Sale \n(each an ``Exchange Data Feed'' and collectively, the ``Exchange Data \nFeeds'') and adopt fees for the Depth of Book and Top of Book Feeds. \nThe Exchange is proposing to implement the proposed fees effective May \n13, 2025.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-102735 (March 27, \n2025) 90 FR 14507 (April 2, 2025) (SR-LTSE-2025-05), which was filed \non March 14, 2025, and replaced SR-LTSE-2025-02. See Securities \nExchange Act Release No. 34-102498 (February 27, 2025), 90 FR 11335 \n(March 5, 2025) (SR-LTSE-2025-02). SR-LTSE-2025-02 replaced SR-LTSE-\n2024-12 which was filed on December 20, 2024. See Securities \nExchange Act Release No. 34-102097 (January 3, 2025) 90 FR 2054 \n(January 10, 2025) (SR-LTSE-2024-12). The fees were initially \nadopted in SR-LTSE-2024-08, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. \n34-101584 (November 12, 2024), 89 FR 90782 (November 18, 2024) (SR-\nLTSE-2024-08). The Exchange is now withdrawing and replacing this \nfiling with SR-LTSE-2025-08.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposed Market Data Pricing\n    The Exchange offers three separate data feeds to subscribers--Depth \nof Book, Top of Book and Last Sale.\\5\\ The Exchange notes that there is \nno requirement that any market participant subscribe to a particular \nExchange Data Feed or any Exchange Data Feed whatsoever, but instead, a \nmarket participant may choose to maintain subscriptions to those \nExchange Data Feeds it deems appropriate based on the firm's business \nmodel. The proposed Exchange Data Feed fees will be the same for each \nsubscriber regardless of size or type of market participant. The \nproposed pricing for each of the Exchange Data Feeds is set forth \nbelow.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See LTSE Rule 11.330. Data Products. The Exchange notes that \nin the Rulebook these feeds are defined as the LTSE MEMOIR Depth, \nLTSE MEMOIR Top and LTSE MEMOIR Last Sale. However, the Exchange is \nsimplifying these names for purposes of simplicity within the LTSE \nFee Schedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDepth of Book\n    The Depth of Book feed is an LTSE-only market data feed that \ncontains all displayed orders for securities trading on the Exchange \n(i.e., top and depth-of-book order data), order executions (i.e., last \nsale data), order cancellations, order modifications, order \nidentification numbers, and administrative messages.\\6\\ For the receipt \nof access to the Depth of Book feed the Exchange proposes to charge \n$2,500 per data recipient per month. The proposed fee would be charged \nto any data recipient that receives the Depth of Book feed for the \npurpose of either internal use within the firm and/or external \ndistribution to Affiliates \\7\\ or for External Use.\\8\\ The proposed fee \nfor Depth of Book will be charged only once per data recipient per \nmonth per subscribing entity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ See LTSE Rule 11.330(a)(1).\n    \\7\\ ``Affiliates'' is defined as any Data Recipient meaning any \nentity that directly or indirectly Controls, is Controlled by, or is \nunder common Control with Data Recipient. An Affiliate of Data \nRecipient is entitled to the same rights granted to Data Recipient \nhereunder including the right to use and distribute the Market Data \nto other Persons subject to the terms of the Exchange Data \nAgreement. See Long-Term Stock Exchange, Inc. Exchange Data \nAgreement. Internal distribution includes the sharing of any \nExchange data product to other legal entities affiliated with the \nfirm that have been disclosed to the Exchange.\n    \\8\\ ``External Use'' is defined as the distribution of Market \nData to Persons who are not officers, employees or Affiliates of the \nDistributor. See Long-Term Stock Exchange, Inc. Exchange Data \nAgreement. External distribution includes a firm that receives an \nExchange data product and then distributes that data to a third-\nparty or one or more data recipients outside the firm.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTop of Book\n    The Top of Book feed is a LTSE-only market data feed that contains \ntop of book quotations based on equity orders entered into the trading \nsystem as well as administrative messages and last sale data.\\9\\ For \nthe receipt of access to the Top of Book feed the Exchange proposes to \ncharge $500 per data recipient per month. The proposed fee would be \ncharged to any data recipient that receives the Top of Book feed for \nthe purpose of either internal distribution within the Company and/or \nwith Affiliates or external distribution for External Use. The proposed \nfee for Top of Book will be charged only once per month per subscribing \nentity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ See LTSE Rule 11.330(a)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLast Sale\n    The Last Sale feed is a LTSE-only market data feed that contains \nonly execution information based on equity orders entered into the \nSystem as well as administrative messages.\\10\\ For the receipt of \naccess to the Last Sale feed the Exchange proposes to charge $0 per \nmonth.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See LTSE Rule 11.330(a)(3).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In proposing to charge fees for Exchange Data Feeds, the Exchange \nhas sought to be especially diligent in assessing those fees in a \ntransparent way against its own aggregate costs of providing the \nrelated services. It has also sought to carefully and transparently \nassess the impact on Members--both generally and in relation to other \nMembers, i.e., to assure the fees will not create a financial burden on \nany participant and will not have an undue impact in particular on \nsmaller Members and competition among Members in general. The Exchange \nbelieves that this level of diligence and transparency is called for by \nthe requirements of Section 19(b)(1) under the Act,\\11\\ and Rule 19b-4 \nthereunder,\\12\\ with respect to the types of information self-\nregulatory organizations (``SROs'') should provide when filing fee \nchanges, and Section 6(b) of the Act,\\13\\ which requires, among other \nthings, that exchange fees be reasonable and equitably allocated,\\14\\\n\n[[Page 22341]]\n\nnot designed to permit unfair discrimination,\\15\\ and that they not \nimpose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act.\\16\\ This rule change proposal \naddresses those requirements, and the analysis and data in each of the \nsections that follow are designed to clearly and comprehensively show \nhow they are met.\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\12\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n    \\13\\ 15 U.S.C.78f(b).\n    \\14\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n    \\15\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\16\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).\n    \\17\\ In 2019, Commission staff published guidance suggesting the \ntypes of information that SROs may use to demonstrate that their fee \nfilings comply with the standards of the Act (``Fee Guidance''). \nWhile LTSE understands that the Fee Guidance does not create new \nlegal obligations on SROs, the Fee Guidance is consistent with \nLTSE's view about the type and level of transparency that exchanges \nshould meet to demonstrate compliance with their existing \nobligations when they seek to charge new fees. See Staff Guidance on \nSRO Rule Filings Relating to Fees (May 21, 2019). Available at \n<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about/staff-guidance-sro-rule-filings-fees\">https://www.sec.gov/about/staff-guidance-sro-rule-filings-fees</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCost Analysis\n    The Exchange notes it operates a unique model where the LTSE \ntrading system and certain associated services are provided on an \noutsourced basis by MEMX Technologies LLC (``MEMX Technologies'').\\18\\ \nAs such, a large portion of the Exchange's technology costs, including \nthose related to Exchange Data Feeds, are incorporated into the overall \nfees that the Exchange pays MEMX Technologies as part of its multi-year \narrangement to provide a trading system and associated services.\\19\\ \nBecause of this arrangement, the Exchange does not possess the same \nlevel of specificity for cost drivers related to market data as other \nexchanges have detailed within their own similar filings. However, the \nExchange recognizes that the fees it pays MEMX Technologies are for the \nservices MEMX Technologies provides to the Exchange and the associated \ncosts incurred by MEMX Technologies. These services and costs include \nmaintaining a team of highly skilled network engineers, fees charged to \nMEMX Technologies by the third-party data center operator for the \nservers and equipment LTSE utilizes, costs associated with projects and \ninitiatives designed to improve overall network performance and \nstability, and costs associated with fully supporting advances in \ninfrastructure and expansion of network level services, including \ncustomer monitoring, alerting and reporting. There are also significant \ntechnology expenses related to establishing and maintaining information \nsecurity services, enhanced network monitoring and customer reporting, \nas well as Regulation SCI mandated processes, associated with the MEMX \nTechnologies network technology. Most of the specific expenses for \nmarket data fees and the Exchange's DSLA with MEMX Technologies are \ncombined, and therefore the Exchange discusses these expenses, and the \nportion allocated to market data as part of the ``Third-Party \nExpenses'' Cost Driver below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ The Exchange and MEMX Technologies executed a Development, \nLicense and Services Agreement on January 23, 2024, with \naccompanying Schedules (collectively, the ``DLSA''). MEMX \nTechnologies, an affiliate of the MEMX Exchange, is in the business \nof developing technology systems for use in the financial industry. \nSee SR-LTSE-2024-03.\n    \\19\\ The DSLA with MEMX Technologies entails both fixed and \nvariable costs. The Exchange used both types of costs when \ndetermining aggregated monthly costs detailed below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, while the Exchange has been operating since September \n2020, it only entered the DLSA with MEMX Technologies in January of \n2024 and launched the new trading system in September 2024. Therefore, \nthe Exchange's most recent publicly available financial statement (2023 \nAudited Unconsolidated Financial Statement) does not reflect the \ncurrent costs associated with development and operation of market data \non LTSE. Accordingly, the Exchange believes it is more appropriate to \njustify its fees utilizing a recent monthly billing cycle and \nextrapolated annualized costs on a going-forward basis.\n    LTSE recently calculated its aggregate monthly costs for providing \nExchange Data Feeds at $223,336 for 2025.\\20\\ Before the launch of the \nnew trading system in September 2024 the Exchange did not offer any \nmarket data products. Now, in order to cover some of the aggregate \ncosts of providing the Exchange Data Feeds to market participants (both \nMembers and non-Members) the Exchange is proposing to modify its Fee \nSchedule and charge the Exchange Market Data Fees detailed herein.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ The aggregate monthly costs were determined by taking the \nindividual cost drivers as detailed below and dividing it annually \nby twelve months.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In order to determine the Exchange's costs for providing the \nservices associated with the Exchange Data Feeds, the Exchange \nconducted an extensive review in which the Exchange analyzed every \nexpense item in the Exchange's general expense ledger to determine \nwhether each such expense relates to the services associated with the \nMarket Data Fees, and, if such expense did so relate, what portion (or \npercentage) of such expense actually supports those services. The sum \nof all such portions of expenses represents the total cost of the \nExchange to provide the services associated with the Exchange Data \nFeeds. For the avoidance of doubt, no expense amount was allocated \ntwice. The Exchange is also providing detailed information regarding \nthe Exchange's cost allocation methodology--namely, information that \nexplains the Exchange's rationale for determining that it was \nreasonable to allocate certain expenses described in this filing \ntowards the total cost to provide Exchange Data Feeds.\n    The Exchange believes that the Market Data Fees are fair and \nreasonable because they will only cover a portion of the total annual \nexpense that the Exchange projects to incur in connection with \nproviding the services associated with the proposed Market Data Fees \nversus the total annual revenue of the Exchange projects to collect in \nconnection with providing those services. Based on market data usage as \nof May 1st, 2025, as well as projected use through the remainder of the \nyear, the Exchange would generate monthly revenues for 2025 of \napproximately $52,000, which will result in a loss for the Exchange.\nCosts Related to Offering Market Data\n    The following chart details the individual line-item costs \nconsidered by LTSE to be related to offering market data as well as the \npercentage of the Exchange's overall costs per year in that area (e.g., \nas set forth below, the Exchange allocated approximately 18% of its \noverall Human Resources cost to offering market data for a total of \n$591,228 per year).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Allocated monthly   Allocated yearly\n                      Cost drivers                             costs              costs             % of all\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThird-Party Expenses...................................           $154,349         $1,852,188                 17\nHuman Resources........................................             49,274            591,228                  9\nData Center............................................             19,713            236,552                 39\n                                                        --------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22342]]\n\n \n    Total..............................................            223,226          2,680,027  .................\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Below are additional details regarding each of the line-item costs \nconsidered by LTSE to be related to offering the Exchange Data Feeds.\nThird-Party Expenses\n    As discussed above, LTSE has undertaken a unique model where it has \noutsourced its trading system and related technology to a third-party \ntechnology provider, MEMX Technologies. With this arrangement LTSE \nreceives, among other things, (1) a state-of-the-art trading engine \nused to generate and disseminate the Exchange Data Feeds; (2) servers \nused at the Exchange's primary and back-up data centers specifically \nfor the Exchange Data Feeds; and (3) hardware and software to operate \nand monitor physical assets necessary to offer the Exchange Data Feeds. \nMEMX Technologies provides personnel to support the use and operation \nof the LTSE trading platform including but not limited to, monitoring \nthe network, managing system development and testing, facilitating \nconnection changes and access changes, as well as performing normal \nmaintenance operations. The Exchange has an additional third-party \nvendor which assists the Exchange with services related to monitoring \nthe trading system. Together these two third-parties account for all \nthe Third-Party expenses.\n    The Exchange took the annual costs for each of these two third-\nparty providers to determine what portion (or percentage) of these \ncosts related to providing market data and thus bears a relationship \nthat is, ``in nature and closeness,'' directly related to market data. \nThere are four major core technology cost buckets associated with \noperating the Exchange: (1) the Member Gateways which include physical \nand logical connectivity, (2) connectivity to the Securities \nInformation Processor (``SIP''), (3) the Trading Engine, and (4) any \ndownstream services which include system reporting, etc. The Exchange \nthen reviewed each of these technology cost buckets in great detail and \ndetermined the percentage each of these buckets should be allocated to \nthe total cost of the third-party expense, with Member Gateways, the \nSIP and the Trading Engine each accounting for 30% of the costs related \nto a third-party provider, and downstream services being allocated the \nremaining 10%. Using this breakdown for both third-party providers, the \nExchange determined the portion of each of these costs that was \nassociated with providing market data, connectivity services or \nneither. Here, the Exchange determined that the 20% allocation for the \ncost of the Trading Engine (30%) should be associated with the cost of \nproviding market data. Additionally, the Exchange determined an \nallocation of 5% for the cost of the Member Gateway (30%) was \nappropriate to associate with the cost of providing market data, as \nwell as 5% (of the overall 10%) should be associated with the cost to \nprovide downstream services.\nHuman Resources\n    In addition to the cost of personnel of outsourced third-party \nproviders that are allocated in the Third-Party Expense section above, \nLTSE then calculated an allocation of LTSE employee time for employees \nwhose functions include providing services necessary to offer the \nExchange Data Feeds, including performance thereof, as well as \npersonnel with ancillary functions related to establishing and \nproviding such services (such as information security and finance \npersonnel). The Exchange notes that system support services to Members \nand non-Members provided by the Exchange and its staff, including \nmonitoring, reporting and other support services, are all handled \ndirectly by LTSE and not MEMX Technologies.\n    The Exchange also allocated Human Resources costs to provide market \ndata to a limited subset of LTSE personnel with ancillary functions \nrelated to monitoring and enabling market data (such as information \nsecurity and finance personnel), for which the Exchange allocated cost \non an employee-by-employee basis (i.e., only including those personnel \nwho do support functions related to providing market data) and then \napplied a smaller allocation to such employees. Blended together, Human \nResources costs to provide market data accounted for 15% of all Human \nResource costs. The Exchange notes that it has fewer than fifty (50) \nemployees, and each department leader has direct knowledge of the time \nspent by each employee with respect to the various tasks necessary to \noperate the Exchange. The estimates of Human Resources cost were \ntherefore determined by consulting with such department leaders, \ndetermining which employees are involved in tasks related to providing \nmarket data, and confirming that the proposed allocations were \nreasonable based on an understanding of the percentage of their time \nsuch employees devote to tasks related to providing market data. The \nExchange notes that senior level executives were only allocated Human \nResources costs to the extent the Exchange believed they are involved \nin overseeing tasks related to providing market data. The Human \nResources cost was calculated using a blended rate of compensation \nreflecting salary, equity and bonus compensation, benefits, payroll \ntaxes, and 401(k) matching contributions.\nData Center\n    In addition to the data center costs included by the Exchange per \nits DSLA with MEMX Technologies which are allocated in the Third-Party \nExpenses above, the Exchange also maintains its own footprint in a \nthird-party data center.\\21\\ Data center costs include an allocation of \nthe costs the Exchange incurs to monitor its trading platform, as well \nas the costs to maintain its equipment in the data center. The Exchange \ndoes not own the data center facilities, but instead, leases space in a \ndata center operated by a third-party.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ LTSE has a presence in the Secaucus NY4 data center that is \noperated by Equinix.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange has two third-party vendors that account for the Data \nCenter expenses. Consistent with the exercise above, the Exchange took \nthe annual costs for each of these two Data Center vendors to determine \nwhat portion (or percentage) of these costs related to providing market \ndata and thus bears a relationship that is, ``in nature and \ncloseness,'' directly related to market data. The Exchange then \nreviewed each of the technology cost buckets detailed above and \ndetermined the percentage each of these buckets should be allocated to \nthe total cost of the Data Center expenses, with Member Gateways, the \nSIP and the Trading Engine each accounting for 30% of the costs related \nto a third-party provider, and downstream services being allocated the \nremaining 10%. Using this breakdown for all Data Center vendors the \nExchange determined the portion of each of these costs was associated \nwith providing market data, connectivity services or neither. Here, the \nExchange\n\n[[Page 22343]]\n\ndetermined that the 15% allocation for the cost of the Member Gateway \n(30%) should be associated with the cost of providing market data. \nAdditionally, the Exchange determined an allocation of 22% for the cost \nof the Trading Engine (30%) was appropriate to associate with the cost \nof providing market data, as well as 7% (of the overall 10%) should be \nassociated with the cost to provide downstream services.\nProposed Fees--Additional Discussion\n    In conducting its cost analysis, the Exchange did not allocate any \nof its expenses in full to any core service and did not double-count \nany expenses. Instead, as described above, the Exchange identified and \nallocated applicable cost drivers across its core services and used the \nsame approach to analyzing costs to form the basis of a separate \nproposal to adopt fees for connectivity services (the ``Connectivity \nFiling'') \\22\\ and this filing proposing fees for Exchange Data Feeds. \nThus, the Exchange's allocations of cost across core services were \nbased on real costs of operating the Exchange and were not double \ncounted across the core services or their associated revenue streams.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-102322 (February \n3, 2025), 90 FR 9175 (February 7, 2025) (SR-LTSE-2025-01) which was \nfiled on January 23, 2025, and replaced SR-LTSE-2024-09. See \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 34-101851 (December 9, 2024), 89 \nFR 101057 (December 13, 2024) (SR-LTSE-2024-09) which was filed on \nNovember 27, 2024, and replaced SR-LTSE-2024-07. See also Securities \nExchange Act Release No. 34-101320 (October 11, 2024), 89 FR 83731 \n(October 17, 2024) (SR-LTSE-2024-07). The fees were initially \nadopted in SR-LTSE-2024-06, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. \n34-101226 (October 1, 2024), 89 FR 81587 (October 8, 2024) (SR-LTSE-\n2024-06).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    LTSE believes the proposed fees for Exchange Data Feeds are fair \nand reasonable as a form of cost recovery for the Exchange's aggregate \ncosts of offering market data. The proposed fees are expected to \ngenerate monthly revenue of approximately $52,000 \\23\\ providing \npartial cost recovery to the Exchange for the aggregate costs of \noffering Exchange Data Feeds, based on a methodology that narrowly \nlimits the cost drivers that are allocated to those closely and \ndirectly related to the particular service. The proposed fees for \nExchange Data Feeds are designed to permit the Exchange to cover a \nportion of costs for providing Exchange Data Feeds, which the Exchange \nbelieves is fair and reasonable after taking into account the costs \nrelated to creating, generating, and disseminating the Exchange Data \nFeeds. LTSE notes that like other exchanges, it is after all, a for-\nprofit business. Accordingly, while the Exchange believes in \ntransparency around costs and potential margins, as well as periodic \nreview of revenues and applicable costs (as discussed below), the \nExchange does not believe that these estimates should form the sole \nbasis of whether or not a proposed fee is reasonable or can be adopted. \nInstead, the Exchange believes that the information should be used \nsolely to confirm that an Exchange is not earning supra-competitive \nprofits, and the Exchange believes its Cost Analysis and related \nprojections demonstrate this fact. As a general matter, the Exchange \nbelieves that its costs will remain relatively similar in future years. \nIt is possible however that such costs will either decrease or \nincrease. To the extent the Exchange sees growth in use of Exchange \nData Feeds it will receive additional revenue to offset future cost \nincreases. However, if use of Exchange Data Feeds is static or \ndecreases, the Exchange might not realize the revenue that it \nanticipates or needs in order to cover applicable costs. Accordingly, \nthe Exchange is committing to conduct a one-year review after \nimplementation of these fees. The Exchange expects that it may propose \nto adjust fees at that time, to increase fees in the event that \nrevenues fail to cover costs and a reasonable mark-up of such costs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ As stated above, the Exchange launched its new trading \nplatform on September 23, 2024. This expected revenue is based on \nmarket data usage as of May 1st, 2025, as well as projected use \nthrough the remainder of the year.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Similarly, the Exchange expects that it would propose to decrease \nfees in the event that revenue materially exceeds current projections. \nIn addition, the Exchange will periodically conduct a review to inform \nits decision making on whether a fee change is appropriate (e.g., to \nmonitor for costs increasing/decreasing or subscribers increasing/\ndecreasing, etc. in ways that suggest the then-current fees are \nbecoming dislocated from the prior cost-based analysis) and expects \nthat it would propose to increase fees in the event that revenues fail \nto cover its costs and a reasonable mark-up, or decrease fees in the \nevent that revenue or the mark-up materially exceeds current \nprojections. In the event that the Exchange determines to propose a fee \nchange, the results of a timely review, including an updated cost \nestimate, will be included in the rule filing proposing the fee change. \nMore generally, the Exchange believes that it is appropriate for an \nexchange to refresh and update information about its relevant costs and \nrevenues in seeking any future changes to fees, and the Exchange \ncommits to do so.\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent \nwith the provisions of Section 6(b) \\24\\ of the Act in general and \nfurthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) \\25\\ of the Act, in \nparticular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable \nallocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its Members \nand other persons using its facilities. Additionally, the Exchange \nbelieves that the proposed fees are consistent with the objectives of \nSection 6(b)(5) \\26\\ of the Act in that they are designed to promote \njust and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and \ncoordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, \nprocessing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions \nin securities, to remove impediments to a free and open market and \nnational market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the \npublic interest, and, particularly, are not designed to permit unfair \ndiscrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f.\n    \\25\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n    \\26\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes prior to addressing the specific reasons the \nExchange believes the proposed fees and fee structure are reasonable, \nequitably allocated and not unreasonably discriminatory, that the \nproposed fee structure described above is consistent with the fee \nstructure used by the Investors Exchange LLC (``IEX'').\\27\\ As such, \nthe Exchange believes it is adopting a model that is easily understood \nby Members and non-Members, most of which also subscribe to market data \nproducts from other exchanges, including IEX. For this reason, the \nExchange believes that the proposed fees described above are consistent \nwith the Act generally, and Section 6(b)(5) \\28\\ of the Act in \nparticular.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\27\\ Similar to LTSE, IEX did not initially charge for market \ndata but it now IEX charges $2,500 per month for its Depth of Book \nFeed (DEEP Feed) and $500 per month for its Top of Book Feed (TOPS \nFeed). All other market data products on IEX are free.\n    \\28\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReasonableness\n    With regard to reasonableness, the Exchange understands that the \nCommission has traditionally taken a market-based approach to examine \nwhether the SRO making the fee proposal was subject to significant \ncompetitive forces in setting the terms of the proposal. The Exchange \nunderstands that in general the analysis considers whether the SRO has\n\n[[Page 22344]]\n\ndemonstrated in its filing that (i) there are reasonable substitutes \nfor the product or service; (ii) ``platform'' competition constrains \nthe ability to set the fee; and/or (iii) revenue and cost analysis \nshows the fee would not result in the SRO taking supracompetitive \nprofits. If the SRO demonstrates that the fee is subject to significant \ncompetitive forces, the Exchange understands that in general the \nanalysis will next consider whether there is any substantial \ncountervailing basis to suggest the fee's terms fail to meet one or \nmore standards under the Act. The Exchange further understands that if \nthe filing fails to demonstrate that the fee is constrained by \ncompetitive forces, the SRO must provide a substantial basis, other \nthan competition, to show that it is consistent with the Act, which may \ninclude production of relevant revenue and cost data pertaining to the \nproduct or service.\n    The Exchange has not determined its proposed overall market data \nfees based on assumptions about market competition, instead relying \nupon a cost-plus model to determine a reasonable fee structure that is \ninformed by the Exchange's understanding of different uses of the \nproducts. In this context, the Exchange believes the proposed fees \noverall are fair and reasonable as a form of partial cost recovery, \nplus provide the possibility of a reasonable return for Exchange's \naggregate costs of offering the Exchange Data Feeds. The Exchange \nbelieves the proposed fees are reasonable because they are designed to \ngenerate annual revenue to recoup some of Exchange's annual costs of \nproviding Exchange Data Feeds. Accordingly, the Exchange believes that \nthis fee methodology is reasonable because it allows the Exchange to \nrecoup some or all of its expenses for providing Exchange Data Feeds. \nThe Exchange also believes that the proposed fees are reasonable \nbecause they are less than the fees charged by a competing exchange \n\\29\\ with comparable market data products, notwithstanding that the \ncompeting exchange may have different system architectures that may \nresult in different cost structures for the provision of market data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ See the MEMX fee schedule, available at <a href=\"https://info.memxtrading.com/equities-trading-resources/us-equities-fee-schedule/\">https://info.memxtrading.com/equities-trading-resources/us-equities-fee-schedule/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes the proposed fees for the Exchange Data Feeds \nare reasonable when compared to fees for comparable products at MEMX \nLLC (``MEMX'').\\30\\ Specifically, the fees for MEMX's MEMOIR Depth \nFeed,\\31\\ MEMOIR Top Feed \\32\\ and MEMOIR Last Sale Feed \\33\\ in most \ninstances are priced higher than the proposed Exchange Data Feeds.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ Id.\n    \\31\\ MEMX charges between $1,500 and $2,500 for its Depth of \nBook Feed.\n    \\32\\ MEMX charges between $750 and $10,000 for its Top of Book \nFeed.\n    \\33\\ MEMX charges between $500 and $10,000 for its Last Sale \nFeed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Specifically with respect to the Depth of Book feed, the Exchange \nbelieves that the proposed fees for such feed are reasonable because \nthe Depth of Book feed contains more information than the Top of Book \nand Last Sale data feeds. The Top of Book and Last Sale data feeds, as \ndescribed above, can be utilized to trade on the Exchange but contain \nless information than that available on the Depth of Book feed (i.e., \neven for a subscriber who takes both feeds, such feeds do not contain \ndepth-of-book information). Thus, the Exchange believes it reasonable \nfor the products to be priced as proposed, with Last Sale having no \nfee, Top of Book priced at $500, and Depth of Book priced at $2500.\nEquitable Allocation\n    The Exchange believes that its proposed fees are reasonable, fair, \nand equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory because they are \ndesigned to align fees with services provided. The Exchange believes \nthat the proposed fees are equitably allocated because they will apply \nuniformly to all data recipients that choose to subscribe to the \nExchange Data Feeds. Any firm that chooses to subscribe to one or more \nExchange Data Feeds is subject to the same Fee Schedule, regardless of \nwhat type of business they operate, and the decision to subscribe to \none or more Exchange Data Feeds is based on objective differences in \nusage of Exchange Data Feeds among different firms, which are still \nultimately in the control of any particular firm. The Exchange believes \nthe proposed pricing among Exchange Data Feeds is equitably allocated \nbecause it is based upon the amount of information contained in each \ndata feed. The Top of Book and Last Sale data feeds, as described \nabove, can be utilized to trade on the Exchange but contain less \ninformation than that is available on the Depth of Book feed (i.e., \neven for a subscriber who takes both feeds, such feeds do not contain \ndepth-of-book information). Thus, the Exchange believes it is an \nequitable allocation of fees for the products to be priced as proposed, \nwith Last Sale having no fee, Top of Book priced at $500, and Depth of \nBook priced at $2500.\\34\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\34\\ The Exchange believes it is equitable and appropriate to \nprovide the Last Sale data for free.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Proposed Fees Are Not Unfairly Discriminatory\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory because they would apply to all data recipients that \nchoose to subscribe to the same Exchange Data Feed(s). Any subscriber \nthat chooses to subscribe to the Exchange Data Feeds is subject to the \nsame Fee Schedule, regardless of what type of business they operate. \nBecause the proposed fees for Depth of Book are higher, subscribers \nseeking lower cost options may instead choose to receive data from the \nSIPs or through the Top of Book and/or Last Sale feed for a lower cost. \nAlternatively, subscribers can choose to pay for the Depth of Book feed \nin order to receive data in a single feed with depth-of-book \ninformation if such information is valuable to subscribers. The \nExchange notes that subscribers can also choose to subscribe to a \ncombination of data feeds for redundancy purposes or to use different \nfeeds for different purposes. In sum, each subscriber has the ability \nto choose the best business solution for itself. The Exchange does not \nbelieve it is unfairly discriminatory to base pricing upon the amount \nof information contained in each data feed. As described above, the Top \nof Book and Last Sale data feeds can be utilized to trade on the \nExchange but contain less information than that is available on the \nDepth of Book feed (i.e., even for a subscriber who takes both feeds, \nsuch feeds do not contain depth-of-book information). Thus, the \nExchange believes it is not unfairly discriminatory for the products to \nbe priced as proposed, with Last Sale having no fee, Top of Book priced \nat $500, and Depth of Book priced at $2500. \\35\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\35\\ The Exchange believes it is not unfairly discriminatory to \nprovide the Last Sale data for free.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\\36\\ the Exchange \ndoes not believe that the proposed rule change would impose any burden \non competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of \nthe purposes of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\36\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntramarket Competition\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed fees for Exchange \nData Feeds place certain market participants at a relative disadvantage \nto other market participants because, as noted\n\n[[Page 22345]]\n\nabove, the proposed fees are associated with usage of Exchange Data \nFeeds by each market participant based on the type of business they \noperate, and the decision to subscribe to one or more Exchange Data \nFeeds is based on objective differences in usage of Exchange Data Feeds \namong different firms, which are still ultimately in the control of any \nparticular firm, and such fees do not impose a barrier to entry to \nsmaller participants. Accordingly, the proposed fees for Exchange Data \nFeeds do not favor certain categories of market participants in a \nmanner that would impose a burden on competition; rather, the \nallocation of the proposed fees reflects the types of Exchange Data \nFeeds consumed by various market participants and their usage thereof.\nIntermarket Competition\n    The Exchange does not believe the proposed fees place an undue \nburden on competition on other SROs that is not necessary or \nappropriate. In particular, market participants are not forced to \nsubscribe to any of the Exchange Data Feeds, as described above. \nAdditionally, another exchange has similar market data fees in place \nfor their participants, but with comparable and in many cases higher \nrates for market data feeds.\\37\\ The proposed fees are based on actual \ncosts and are designed to enable the Exchange to recoup a portion of \nits costs related to providing market data. Competing equities \nexchanges are free to adopt comparable fee structures subject to the \nSEC rule filing process.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\37\\ See supra, footnote 28 [sic] referencing MEMX Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    This proposed rule change establishes dues, fees or other charges \namong its members and, as such, may take effect upon filing with the \nCommission pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act \\38\\ and \nparagraph (f)(2) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.\\39\\ Accordingly, the \nproposed rule change would take effect upon filing with the Commission.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\38\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii).\n    \\39\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule \nchange, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend the rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that the action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \nwould otherwise further the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.\n\nIV.

(``LTSE'' or \n``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, \nand III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The \nCommission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the \nproposed rule change from interested persons.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(``Commission'') a proposed rule change to amend the LTSE Fee Schedule \n(the ``Fee Schedule'') to establish Section C and adopt Connectivity \nFees for Cross-Connects at the Primary, Disaster Recovery and Test \nEnvironment facilities. The Exchange also proposes to adopt \nConnectivity Fees for Logical Connectivity (all environments), \neffective May 12, 2025.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange's \nwebsite at <a href=\"https://longtermstockexchange.com/\">https://longtermstockexchange.com/</a>, at the principal office \nof the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\n[[Page 22346]]\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, \nset forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant \naspects of such statements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange is proposing to establish a new section (C. \nConnectivity Fees) in the Long-Term Stock Exchange Fee Schedule. Prior \nto the launch of the new trading system on September 23, 2024, the \nExchange offered connectivity (both physical and logical) at no cost to \nall market participants. With the launch of the new trading system and \nthe significant costs detailed below, the Exchange determined it was \nreasonable and appropriate to begin to charge market participants for \ntheir connectivity to the Exchange. The Exchange notes that the \ntransition between trading systems required all market participants to \nset up new connectivity to the new trading system, and after the \nsuccessful launch the Exchange decommissioned all the historical \nconnections within the old trading system. The Exchange also notes that \nmarket participants were not charged simultaneously for both their old \nconnections and new connections during the transition as the Exchange \nnever charged for connectivity to the old trading system.\nCross-Connect Fees\n    The Exchange proposes to offer to both Members \\3\\ and non-Members \nthe option to utilize a 10 Gigabit (``Gb'') ultra-low latency (``ULL'') \nfiber cross-connection to the Exchange's Primary and Disaster Recovery \nfacilities, as well as a 10Gb ULL fiber cross-connection to the Test \nEnvironment. The Exchange proposes to establish a Cross-Connect fee of \n$5,500 per 10Gb physical interface per month that will be assessed to \nMembers and non-Members for connecting to the Primary facility. The \nExchange proposes to establish a Cross-Connect fee of $2,750 per 10Gb \nphysical interface per month that will be assessed to Members and non-\nMembers for connecting to either the Disaster Recovery facility or the \nTest Environment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The term ``Member'' shall mean any registered broker or \ndealer that has been admitted to membership in the Exchange. See \nLTSE Rule 1.160.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Monthly network connectivity fees for Members and non-Members for \nconnectivity will be assessed in any month the Member or non-Member is \ncredentialed to use any of the LTSE Application Programming Interfaces \n(``APIs'') in the Primary facility, Disaster Recovery facility or Test \nEnvironment.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ As proposed, fees for connectivity services would be \nassessed based on each active connectivity service product at the \nclose of business on the first day of each month. If a product is \ncanceled prior to such fee being assessed, then the Member will not \nbe obligated to pay the applicable product fee.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPort Fees\n    The Exchange proposes to establish a $450 fee for all Logical \nConnectivity sessions. These application sessions, commonly known as \nports, are utilized to perform a particular function on the Exchange, \nsuch as order entry or order cancellation, receipt of drop copies, \nproprietary market data dissemination, or requesting data to be \nbackfilled (i.e., ``gap ports''). All market participants (Members and \nnon-Members) will be charged per session per month. The Exchange will \nwaive the fees for three sessions per month per market participant \nwhich the Exchange believes will encourage Members to connect to the \nExchange's backup trading systems and to conduct appropriate testing of \ntheir use of the Exchange.\n    In proposing to charge fees for connectivity to LTSE, the Exchange \nhas sought to be especially diligent in assessing those fees in a \ntransparent way against its own aggregate costs of providing the \nrelated services, and also carefully and transparently assessing the \nimpact on market participants--both generally and in relation to other \nmarket participants, i.e., to assure the fee will not create a \nfinancial burden on any participant and will not have an undue impact \nin particular on smaller market participants and competition among \nmarket participants in general. The Exchange believes that this level \nof diligence and transparency is called for by the requirements of \nSection 19(b)(1) under the Act,\\5\\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\\6\\ with \nrespect to the types of information self-regulatory organizations \n(``SROs'') should provide when filing fee changes, and Section 6(b) of \nthe Act,\\7\\ which requires, among other things, that exchange fees be \nreasonable and equitably allocated,\\8\\ not designed to permit unfair \ndiscrimination,\\9\\ and that they not impose a burden on competition not \nnecessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.\\10\\ \nThis rule change proposal addresses those requirements, and the \nanalysis and data in each of the sections that follow are designed to \nclearly and comprehensively show how they are met.\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\6\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C.78f(b).\n    \\8\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n    \\9\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).\n    \\11\\ In 2019, Commission staff published guidance suggesting the \ntypes of information that SROs may use to demonstrate that their fee \nfilings comply with the standards of the Act (``Fee Guidance''). \nWhile LTSE understands that the Fee Guidance does not create new \nlegal obligations on SROs, the Fee Guidance is consistent with \nLTSE's view about the type and level of transparency that exchanges \nshould meet to demonstrate compliance with their existing \nobligations when they seek to charge new fees. See Staff Guidance on \nSRO Rule Filings Relating to Fees (May 21, 2019). Available at: \n<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about/staff-guidance-sro-rule-filings-fees\">https://www.sec.gov/about/staff-guidance-sro-rule-filings-fees</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCost Analysis\n    The Exchange notes it operates a unique model where the LTSE \ntrading system and certain associated services are provided on an \noutsourced basis by MEMX Technologies LLC (``MEMX Technologies'').\\12\\ \nAs such, a large portion of the Exchange's technology costs, including \nthose related to connectivity, are incorporated into the overall fees \nthat the Exchange pays MEMX Technologies as part of its multi-year \narrangement to provide a trading system and associated services.\\13\\ \nBecause of this arrangement, the Exchange does not possess the same \nlevel of specificity for cost drivers related to connectivity as other \nexchanges have detailed within their own similar filings. However, the \nExchange recognizes that the fees it pays MEMX Technologies are for the \nservices MEMX Technologies provides to the Exchange and the associated \ncosts incurred by MEMX Technologies. These services and costs include \nmaintaining a team of highly skilled network engineers, fees charged to \nMEMX\n\n[[Page 22347]]\n\nTechnologies by the third-party data center operator for the servers \nand equipment LTSE utilizes, costs associated with projects and \ninitiatives designed to improve overall network performance and \nstability, and costs associated with fully supporting advances in \ninfrastructure and expansion of network level services, including \ncustomer monitoring, alerting and reporting. There are also significant \ntechnology expenses related to establishing and maintaining information \nsecurity services, enhanced network monitoring and customer reporting, \nas well as Regulation SCI mandated processes, associated with the MEMX \nTechnologies network technology that are borne by the Exchange. Most of \nthe specific expenses for connectivity services and the Exchange's DSLA \nwith MEMX Technologies are combined, and therefore the Exchange \ndiscusses these expenses, and the portion allocated to connectivity as \npart of the ``Third-Party Expenses'' Cost Driver below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ The Exchange and MEMX Technologies executed a Development, \nLicense and Services Agreement on January 23, 2024, with \naccompanying Schedules (collectively, the ``DLSA''). MEMX \nTechnologies, an affiliate of the MEMX Exchange, is in the business \nof developing technology systems for use in the financial industry. \nSee SR-LTSE-2024-03, supra note 3 [sic].\n    \\13\\ The DSLA with MEMX Technologies entails both fixed and \nvariable costs. The Exchange used both types of costs when \ndetermining aggregated monthly costs detailed below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, while the Exchange has been operating since September \n2020, it only entered the DLSA with MEMX Technologies in January of \n2024 and launched the new trading system in September 2024. Therefore, \nthe Exchange's most recent publicly available financial statement (2023 \nAudited Unconsolidated Financial Statement) does not reflect LTSE's \nactual current costs associated with the development and operation of \nconnectivity on LTSE, as the costs associated with the MEMX system \nbegan in 2024. Accordingly, the Exchange believes it is more \nappropriate to justify its fees utilizing a recent monthly billing \ncycle and extrapolated annualized costs on a going-forward basis.\n    LTSE recently calculated its aggregate monthly costs for providing \nconnectivity services to the Exchange at approximately $596,840 for \n2025.\\14\\ Because LTSE offered all connectivity free of charge from its \nlaunch in September 2020 until October of 2024, LTSE has borne 100% of \nall connectivity costs. Now, in order to cover some of the aggregate \ncosts of providing connectivity to market participants (both Members \nand non-Members),\\15\\ the Exchange is proposing to modify its Fee \nSchedule and charge the fees for connectivity detailed herein.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ The aggregate monthly costs were determined by taking the \nindividual cost drivers detailed below and their yearly costs and \ndividing by twelve months.\n    \\15\\ Types of market participants that obtain connectivity \nservices from the Exchange but are not Members include service \nbureaus and extranets. Service bureaus offer technology-based \nservices to other companies for a fee, including order entry \nservices to Members, and thus, may access application sessions on \nbehalf of one or more Members. Extranets offer physical connectivity \nservices to Members and non-Members.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In order to determine the Exchange's costs for providing the \nservices associated with connectivity, the Exchange conducted an \nextensive review in which the Exchange analyzed every expense item in \nthe Exchange's general expense ledger to determine whether each such \nexpense relates to the services associated with the connectivity and, \nif such expense did so relate, what portion (or percentage) of such \nexpense actually supports those services. The sum of all such portions \nof expenses represents the total cost of the Exchange to provide the \nservices associated with connectivity. For the avoidance of doubt, no \nexpense amount was allocated twice. The Exchange is also providing \ndetailed information regarding the Exchange's cost allocation \nmethodology--namely, information that explains the Exchange's rationale \nfor determining that it was reasonable to allocate certain expenses \ndescribed in this filing towards the total cost to the Exchange to \nprovide connectivity.\n    The Exchange believes that the Connectivity Fees are fair and \nreasonable because they will only cover a portion of the total annual \nexpense that the Exchange projects to incur with providing the services \nassociated with connectivity versus the total annual revenue the \nExchange projects to collect in connection with providing those \nservices. Based on connectivity services usage as of May 1st, 2025, as \nwell as projected use through the remainder of the year, the Exchange \nwould generate monthly revenues for 2025 of approximately $475,000, \nwhich will result in a loss for the Exchange.\nCosts Related To Offering Connectivity\n    The following chart details the individual line-item costs \nconsidered by LTSE to be related to offering connectivity as well as \nthe percentage of the Exchange's overall costs per year that such costs \nrepresent for such area (e.g., as set forth below, the Exchange \nallocated approximately 15% of its overall Human Resources cost to \noffering connectivity for a total of $490,213 per year of costs related \nto providing connectivity).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Allocated monthly   Allocated yearly\n                      Cost drivers                             costs              costs             % of all\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThird-Party Expenses...................................           $539,276         $6,471,312                 60\nHuman Resources........................................             40,851            490,213                  8\nData Center............................................             15,713            188,552                 31\n                                                        --------------------------------------------------------\n    Total..............................................            595,840          7,150,076  .................\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Below are additional details regarding each of the line-item costs \nconsidered by LTSE to be related to offering connectivity.\nThird-Party Expenses\n    As discussed above, LTSE has undertaken a unique model where it has \noutsourced its trading system and related technology to a third-party \ntechnology provider, MEMX Technologies. With this arrangement LTSE \nreceives, among other things, (1) access to technology used to complete \nconnections to the Exchange and to connect to external markets, (2) \nphysical connectivity in the data centers where MEMX Technologies \nmaintains equipment for LTSE use--such as dedicated space, security \nservices, cooling and power, (3) use of physical ports and logical \nports, and (4) use of physical assets and software, which also includes \nassets used for testing and monitoring of infrastructure. MEMX \nTechnologies provides personnel to support the use and operation of the \nLTSE trading platform including but not limited to, monitoring the \nnetwork, managing system development and testing, facilitating \nconnection changes and access changes, as well as performing normal \nmaintenance operations. The Exchange has an additional third-party \nvendor which assists the Exchange with services related to member \ngateways. Together these two third-parties account for all\n\n[[Page 22348]]\n\nthe Third-Party expenses detailed above.\n    The Exchange took the annual costs for each of these two third-\nparty providers to determine what portion (or percentage) of these \ncosts related to providing connectivity and thus bears a relationship \nthat is, ``in nature and closeness,'' directly related to offering \nconnectivity. There are four major core technology cost buckets \nassociated with operating the Exchange: (1) the Member Gateways which \ninclude physical and logical connectivity, (2) connectivity to the \nSecurities Information Processor (``SIP''), (3) the Trading Engine, and \n(4) any downstream services which include system reporting, etc. The \nExchange then reviewed each of these technology cost buckets in great \ndetail and determined the percentage each of these buckets should be \nallocated to the total cost of the third-party expense, with Member \nGateways, the SIP and the Trading Engine each accounting for 30% of the \ncosts related to a third-party provider, and downstream services being \nallocated the remaining 10%. Using this breakdown for both third-party \nproviders, the Exchange determined the portion of each of these costs \nthat was associated with providing market data, connectivity services \nor neither. Here, the Exchange determined that most of the allocation \nfor the cost of the Gateways (25%) should be associated with the cost \nof offering connectivity, as well as 5% (of the overall 10%) to \ndownstream services. Blended together, the Exchange allocated 29% of \nits overall Third-Party costs to offering connectivity.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ The Exchange notes that this percentage is based on set \ncosts in both Third-Party contracts. The variable costs that are \ndirectly related to offering connectivity are 100% allocated to the \noverall Third-Party costs. Without these variable costs the \npercentage allocated to offering connecting for Third-Party costs \nwould be 29%.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHuman Resources\n    In addition to the cost of personnel of outsourced third-party \nproviders that are allocated in the Third-Party Expense section above, \nLTSE then calculated an allocation of LTSE employee time for employees \nwhose functions include providing and maintaining connectivity and \nperformance thereof (technical operations personnel, market operations \npersonnel, and software engineering personnel). The Exchange notes that \nwhile MEMX Technologies maintains its own network support services, due \nto its independent regulatory oversight obligations, direct network \nsupport services to Members and non-Members provided by the Exchange \nand its staff, including network monitoring, reporting and support \nservices, are all handled directly by LTSE and not MEMX Technologies.\n    The Exchange also allocated Human Resources costs to provide \nconnectivity to a limited subset of LTSE personnel with ancillary \nfunctions related to establishing and maintaining such connectivity \n(such as information security and finance personnel), for which the \nExchange allocated cost on an employee-by-employee basis (i.e., only \nincluding those personnel who do support functions related to providing \nconnectivity) and then applied a smaller allocation to such employees. \nBlended together, Human Resources costs to provide connectivity \naccounted for 15% of all Human Resource costs. The Exchange notes that \nit has fewer than fifty (50) employees, and each department leader has \ndirect knowledge of the time spent by each employee with respect to the \nvarious tasks necessary to operate the Exchange. The estimates of Human \nResources cost were therefore determined by consulting with such \ndepartment leaders, determining which employees are involved in tasks \nrelated to providing connectivity, and confirming that the proposed \nallocations were reasonable based on an understanding of the percentage \nof their time such employees devote to tasks related to providing \nconnectivity. The Exchange notes that senior level executives were only \nallocated Human Resources costs to the extent the Exchange believed \nthey are involved in overseeing tasks related to providing \nconnectivity. The Human Resources cost was calculated using a blended \nrate of compensation reflecting salary, equity and bonus compensation, \nbenefits, payroll taxes, and 401(k) matching contributions.\nData Center\n    In addition to the data center costs incurred by MEMX Technologies \nwhich are allocated in the Third-Party Expenses above, the Exchange \nalso maintains its own footprint in a third-party data center.\\17\\ Data \ncenter costs include an allocation of the costs the Exchange incurs to \nmonitor its trading platform (including the Primary facility, Disaster \nRecovery facility and Test Environment facility) as well as the costs \nto maintain its equipment in the data center. The Exchange does not own \nthe data center facilities but, instead, leases space in a data center \noperated by a third-party.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ LTSE has a presence in the Secaucus NY4 data center that is \noperated by Equinix.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange has two third-party vendors that account for the Data \nCenter expenses. Consistent with the exercise above, the Exchange took \nthe annual costs for each of these two Data Center vendors to determine \nwhat portion (or percentage) of these costs related to offering \nconnectivity and thus bears a relationship that is, ``in nature and \ncloseness,'' directly related to connectivity. The Exchange then \nreviewed each of the technology cost buckets detailed above and \ndetermined the percentage each of these buckets should be allocated to \nthe total cost of the Data Center expenses, with Member Gateways, the \nSIP and the Trading Engine each accounting for 30% of the costs related \nto a third-party provider, and downstream services being allocated the \nremaining 10%. Using this breakdown for all Data Center vendors the \nExchange determined the portion of each of these costs was associated \nwith providing market data, connectivity services or neither. Here, the \nExchange determined that the 31% of the Data Center costs were \nappropriate to allocate to offering connectivity as they included \nservices such as network packet capture for performance monitoring, \nsecurity information and event management, network connectivity and \nsecurity monitoring. In comparison the Exchange allocated 39% of Data \nCenter costs to the offering of market data. The remaining 30% of Data \nCenter costs were not allocated to either Market Data or Connectivity.\nPhysical Connectivity Fees\n    With the launch of the new trading platform, LTSE required Members \nand non-Members to establish all new connections (both physical and \nlogical) to the Exchange in order to transmit orders to and receive \ninformation through the new trading platform. Members and non-Members \ncan also choose to connect to LTSE indirectly through physical \nconnectivity maintained by a third-party extranet.\\18\\ Extranet \nphysical connections may provide access to one or multiple Members and \nnon-Members on a single connection. Users of LTSE physical connectivity \nservices (both Members and non-Members) seeking to establish one or \nmore connections with the Exchange submit a request directly to \nExchange personnel. Upon receipt of the completed instructions, LTSE \nestablishes the physical connections requested by the market \nparticipant. The number of physical connections assigned to each firm \nas of May 1st,\n\n[[Page 22349]]\n\n2025, ranges from one to three, depending on the scope and scale of the \nfirm's trading activity on the Exchange as determined by the firm, \nincluding the firm's determination of the need for redundant \nconnectivity. The Exchange notes that 58% of its Members do not \nmaintain a physical connection directly with the Exchange in the \nPrimary facilities (though many such Members have connectivity through \na third-party provider) and another 42% have either one or two physical \nconnections to the Exchange in the Primary facilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ The Exchange notes that these third-party extranet \nproviders were also required to establish new connections to LTSE as \nall of the old connections were deemed obsolete with the launch of \nthe new trading platform.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As described above, to cover a portion the aggregate costs of \nproviding physical connectivity to Members and non-Members, as \ndescribed below, the Exchange is proposing to charge a fee of $5,500 \nper month for each physical connection in the Primary facility and a \nfee of $2,750 per month for each physical connection in the Disaster \nRecovery and Test Environment facilities. There is no requirement that \nany Member or non-Member maintain a specific number of physical \nconnections and a Member or non-Member may choose to maintain as many \nor as few of such connections as each Member or non-Member deems \nappropriate. The Exchange notes, however, that pursuant to Rule 2.250 \n(Mandatory Participation in Testing of Backup Systems), the Exchange \ndoes require a small number of Members to connect and participate in \nfunctional and performance testing as announced by the Exchange, which \noccurs at least once every 12 months. Specifically, Members that have \nbeen determined by the Exchange to contribute a meaningful percentage \nof the Exchange's overall volume must participate in mandatory testing \nof the Exchange's backup systems (i.e., such Members must connect to \nthe Disaster Recovery facility). The Exchange notes that Members that \nhave been designated are still able to use third-party providers of \nconnectivity to access the Exchange at its Disaster Recovery facility \nin that these Members do not each have to purchase a separate \nconnection to the Disaster Recovery facility. Four of the designated \nMembers use a third-party provider instead of connecting directly to \nthe Disaster Recovery facility through connectivity provided by the \nExchange. Nonetheless, because some Members are required to connect to \nthe Disaster Recovery facility pursuant to Rule 2.250 and to encourage \nMembers and non-Members to connect to the Disaster Recovery facility \ngenerally, the Exchange has proposed to charge one-half of the fee for \na physical connection in the Primary facility. Further, other exchanges \nalso provide lower connectivity fees for connections to their \nrespective disaster recovery facilities.\\19\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ See, e.g., the CBOE BZX equities fee schedule, available \nat: <a href=\"https://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/membership/fee_schedule/bzx/\">https://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/membership/fee_schedule/bzx/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    While Members are required to connect to the Test Environment for \ninitial protocol certification and may be required to connect to the \nTest Environment at other times throughout the year (i.e., if the \nExchange adopts a new order type that requires testing), they do not \nhave to connect directly and can use an extranet provider to connect or \naccess the LTSE Test Environment directly.\n    The proposed fee will not apply differently based upon the size or \ntype of the market participant but rather based upon the number of \nphysical connections a Member or non-Member requests, which number is \nbased upon factors deemed relevant by each firm (either a Member, \nservice bureau or extranet). The Exchange believes these factors \ninclude the costs to maintain connectivity, business model and choices \nMembers and non-Members make in how to participate on the Exchange, as \nfurther described below. The proposed connectivity fees are designed to \npermit the Exchange to cover a portion of costs allocated to providing \nconnectivity services. The Exchange also reiterates that the Exchange \ndid not charge any fees for connectivity services prior to October \n2024, and its allocation of costs to physical connections was part of a \nholistic allocation that also allocated costs to other core services \nwithout double-counting any expenses. As noted above, the Exchange \nproposes a lower rate of $2,750 per month for physical connections at \nits Disaster Recovery facility and Test Environment. The Exchange has \nproposed this lower rate for Disaster Recovery and Test Environment \nconnectivity in order to encourage Members and non-Members to establish \nand maintain such connections. Also, as noted above, a small number of \nMembers are required pursuant to Rule 2.4 to connect and participate in \ntesting of the Exchange's backup systems, and the Exchange believes it \nis appropriate to provide a lower rate for physical connections at the \nDisaster Recovery facility given this requirement. The Exchange notes \nthat this rate is well below the cost of providing such services and \nthe Exchange will offer connectivity to the Disaster Recovery facility \nand Test Environment without recouping the full amount of such cost \nthrough connectivity services.\nLogical Connectivity Fees\n    Similar to other exchanges, LTSE offers its Members application \nsessions, also known as logical ports, for order entry and receipt of \ntrade execution reports and order messages. Members can also choose to \nconnect to LTSE indirectly through a session maintained by a third-\nparty service bureau. Service bureau sessions may provide access to one \nor multiple Members on a single session. Users of LTSE connectivity \nservices (both Members and non-Members) seeking to establish one or \nmore application sessions with the Exchange shall submit a request to \nthe Exchange. Upon receipt of the completed instructions, LTSE assigns \nthe Member or non-Member the number of sessions requested. The number \nof sessions assigned to each Member as of September 30, 2024, ranges \nfrom one (1) to more than 58 depending on the scope and scale of the \nMember's trading activity on the Exchange (either through a direct \nconnection or through a service bureau) as determined by the Member. \nFor example, by using multiple sessions, Members can segregate order \nflow from different internal desks, business lines, or customers. The \nExchange does not impose any minimum or maximum requirements for how \nmany application sessions a Member or service bureau can maintain, and \nit is not proposing to impose any minimum or maximum session \nrequirements for its Members or their service bureaus.\n    As described above, to cover a portion of the aggregate costs of \nproviding application sessions to Members and non-Members, as described \nbelow, the Exchange is proposing to charge a fee of $450 per session \nper month. The Exchange notes that it is proposing to waive the fees \nfor Members and non-Members for their first three sessions, so that \nmarket participants can have no cost to initiate order entry in all \nthree environments (Primary, Disaster Recovery and Test Environments). \nFurther, the Exchange believes that providing three free sessions will \nencourage Members to connect to the Exchange's backup trading systems \nand to conduct appropriate testing of their use of the Exchange.\n    The proposed fee of $450 per month for each Logical Connectivity \nsession is designed to permit the Exchange to cover some of the costs \nallocated to providing application sessions.\n    The proposed fee is also designed to encourage Members and non-\nMembers to be efficient with their application session usage, thereby \nresulting in a corresponding increase in the efficiency\n\n[[Page 22350]]\n\nthat the Exchange would be able to realize in managing its aggregate \ncosts for providing connectivity services. There is no requirement that \nany Member maintain a specific number of application sessions and a \nMember may choose to maintain as many or as few of such ports as each \nMember deems appropriate. The platform has been designed such that each \nlogical connectivity session can handle a significant amount of message \ntraffic (i.e., over 50,000 orders per second), and has no application \nflow control or order throttling.\n    The proposed fee will not apply differently based upon the size or \ntype of the market participant but rather based upon the number of \napplication sessions a Member or non-Member requests, which number is \nbased upon factors deemed relevant by each firm (either a Member or \nservice bureau on behalf of a Member). The Exchange believes these \nfactors include the costs to maintain connectivity and choices Members \nmake in how to segment or allocate their order flow.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ The Exchange understands that some Members (or service \nbureaus) may also request more sessions to enable the ability to \nsend a greater number of simultaneous order messages to the Exchange \nby spreading orders over more Order Entry Ports, thereby increasing \nthroughput (i.e., the potential for more orders to be processed in \nthe same amount of time). The degree to which this usage of sessions \nprovides any throughput advantage is based on how a particular \nmarket participant sends order messages to LTSE, however the \nExchange notes that the architecture reduces the impact or necessity \nof such a strategy. All sessions on LTSE provide the same \nthroughput, and as noted above, the throughput is likely adequate \neven for a market participant sending a significant amount of volume \nat a fast pace and is not artificially throttled or limited in any \nway by the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposed Fees--Additional Discussion\n    As discussed above, the proposed fees for connectivity services do \nnot by design apply differently to different types or sizes of Members \nor non-Members. As discussed in more detail in the Statutory Basis \nsection, the Exchange believes that the likelihood of higher fees for \ncertain Members or non-Members subscribing to connectivity services \nusage than others is not unfairly discriminatory because it is based on \nobjective differences in usage of connectivity services among different \nMembers and non-Members. The Exchange's costs for connectivity services \nare directly proportional to the number of connections utilized. \nMembers and non-Members with higher message traffic and/or Members and \nnon-Members with more complicated connections established with the \nExchange: (1) consume the most bandwidth and resources of the network; \n(2) transact the vast majority of the volume on the Exchange; and (3) \nrequire the high-touch network support services provided by the \nExchange and its technology service provider, including network \nmonitoring, reporting and support services, resulting in a much higher \ncost to the Exchange to provide such connectivity services. For these \nreasons, LTSE believes it is not unfairly discriminatory for the \nMembers and non-Members with higher message traffic and/or Members and \nnon-Members with more complicated connections to pay a higher share of \nthe total connectivity services fees. While Members and non-Members \nwith a business model that results in higher relative inbound message \nactivity or more complicated connections are projected to pay higher \nfees, the level of such fees is based solely on the number of physical \nconnections and/or application sessions deemed necessary by the Member \nand non-Members and not on the business model or type of firm. The \nExchange notes that the correlation between message traffic and usage \nof connectivity services is not completely aligned because Members and \nnon-Members individually determine how many physical connections and \napplication sessions to request, and Members and non-Members may make \ndifferent decisions on the appropriate ways based on facts unique to \ntheir individual businesses. The Exchange believes that a Member, even \nwith high message traffic, would be able to conduct business on the \nExchange with a relatively small connectivity services footprint.\n    Finally, the fees for connectivity services will help to encourage \nconnectivity services usage in a way that aligns with the Exchange's \nregulatory obligations. As a national securities exchange, the Exchange \nis subject to Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (``Reg \nSCI'').\\21\\ Reg SCI Rule 1001(a) requires that the Exchange establish, \nmaintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably \ndesigned to ensure (among other things) that its Reg SCI systems have \nlevels of capacity adequate to maintain the Exchange's operational \ncapability and promote the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.\\22\\ \nBy encouraging market participants to be efficient with their usage of \nconnectivity services, the fees will support the Exchange's Reg SCI \nobligations in this regard by ensuring that unused application sessions \nare available to be allocated based on individual Member or non-Member \nneeds and as the Exchange's overall order and trade volumes increase. \nThis will encourage market participants to purchase only what they \nneed. Additionally, because the Exchange will charge a lower rate for a \nphysical connection to the Disaster Recovery and Test Environment \nfacilities and will waive the first three logical connectivity sessions \neach month, the proposed fee structure will further support the \nExchange's Reg SCI compliance by reducing the potential impact of a \ndisruption should the Exchange be required to switch to its Disaster \nRecovery Facility and encouraging Members to engage in any necessary \nsystem testing with low or no cost imposed by the Exchange.\\23\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ 17 CFR 242.1000-1007.\n    \\22\\ 17 CFR 242.1001(a).\n    \\23\\ While some Members might directly connect to the Disaster \nRecovery or Test Environment Facilities and incur the proposed \n$2,750 per month fee, there are other ways to connect to the \nExchange, such as through a service bureau or extranet, and because \nthe Exchange is waiving fees for the first three logical \nconnectivity sessions, a Member connecting through another method \nwould not incur any fees charged directly by the Exchange. However, \nthe Exchange notes that a third-party service provider providing \nconnectivity to the Exchange likely would charge a fee for providing \nsuch connectivity; such fees are not set by or shared in by the \nExchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent \nwith the provisions of Section 6(b) \\24\\ of the Act in general and \nfurthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) \\25\\ of the Act in \nparticular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable \nallocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its Members \nand other persons using its facilities. Additionally, the Exchange \nbelieves that the proposed fees are consistent with the objectives of \nSection 6(b)(5) \\26\\ of the Act in that they are designed to promote \njust and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and \ncoordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, \nprocessing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions \nin securities, to remove impediments to a free and open market and \nnational market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the \npublic interest, and, particularly, are not designed to permit unfair \ndiscrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f.\n    \\25\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n    \\26\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed fees for connectivity \nservices to LTSE are reasonable, equitable and not unfairly \ndiscriminatory because, as described above, the proposed pricing for \nconnectivity services is directly related to the relative costs to the\n\n[[Page 22351]]\n\nExchange to provide those respective services and does not impose a \nbarrier to entry to smaller participants.\n    As detailed above, the Exchange recognizes that there are various \nbusiness models and varying sizes of market participants conducting \nbusiness on the Exchange. The Exchange's costs for connectivity \nservices are directly proportional to the number of connections \nutilized. Members and non-Members with higher message traffic and/or \nMembers and non-Members with more complicated connections established \nwith the Exchange: (1) consume the most bandwidth and resources of the \nnetwork; (2) transact the vast majority of the volume on the Exchange; \nand (3) require the high-touch network support services provided by the \nExchange and its technology service provider, including network \nmonitoring, reporting and support services, resulting in a much higher \ncost to the Exchange to provide such connectivity services.\n    Accordingly, the Exchange believes the allocation of the proposed \nfees that increase based on the number of physical connections or \napplication sessions is reasonable based on the resources consumed by \nthe respective type of market participant (i.e., lowest resource \nconsuming Members and non-Members will pay the least, and highest \nresource consuming Members and non-Members will pay the most), \nparticularly since higher resource consumption translates directly to \nhigher costs to the Exchange.\n    With regard to reasonableness, the Exchange understands that when \nappropriate given the context of a proposal the Commission has taken a \nmarket-based approach to examine whether the SRO making the proposal \nwas subject to significant competitive forces in setting the terms of \nthe proposal. In looking at this question, the Commission considers \nwhether the SRO has demonstrated in its filing that: (i) there are \nreasonable substitutes for the product or service; (ii) ``platform'' \ncompetition constrains the ability to set the fee; and/or (iii) revenue \nand cost analysis shows the fee would not result in the SRO taking \nsupra-competitive profits. If the SRO demonstrates that the fee is \nsubject to significant competitive forces, the Commission will next \nconsider whether there is any substantial countervailing basis to \nsuggest the fee's terms fail to meet one or more standards under the \nExchange Act. If the filing fails to demonstrate that the fee is \nconstrained by competitive forces, the SRO must provide a substantial \nbasis, other than competition, to show that it is consistent with the \nExchange Act, which may include production of relevant revenue and cost \ndata pertaining to the product or service.\n    LTSE believes the proposed fees for connectivity services are fair \nand reasonable as a form of cost recovery for the Exchange's aggregate \ncosts of offering connectivity services to Members and non-Members. The \nproposed fees are expected to generate monthly revenue of approximately \n$475,000 \\27\\ providing partial cost recovery to the Exchange for the \naggregate costs of offering connectivity services, based on a \nmethodology that narrowly limits the cost drivers that are allocated to \nthose closely and directly related to the particular service. In \naddition, this revenue will allow the Exchange to continue to offer, to \nenhance, and to continually refresh its infrastructure as necessary to \noffer a state-of-the-art trading platform. The Exchange also believes \nthe proposed fee is a reasonable means of encouraging firms to be \nefficient in the connectivity services they reserve for use, with the \nbenefits to overall system efficiency to the extent Members and non-\nMembers consolidate their usage of connectivity services or discontinue \nsubscriptions to unused physical connectivity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\27\\ As stated above, the Exchange launched its new trading \nplatform on September 23, 2024. This expected revenue is based on \nconnectivity services usage as of May 1st, 2025, as well as \nprojected use through the remainder of the year.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange further believes that the proposed fees, as they \npertain to purchasers of each type of connectivity alternative, \nconstitute an equitable allocation of reasonable fees charged to the \nExchange's Members and non-Members and are allocated fairly amongst the \ntypes of market participants using the facilities of the Exchange.\n    As described above, the Exchange believes the proposed fees are \nequitably allocated because the Exchange's costs for connectivity \nservices are directly proportional to the number of connections \nutilized. Members and non-Members with higher message traffic and/or \nMembers and non-Members with more complicated connections established \nwith the Exchange: (1) consume the most bandwidth and resources of the \nnetwork; (2) transact the vast majority of the volume on the Exchange; \nand (3) require the high-touch network support services provided by the \nExchange and its technology service provider, including network \nmonitoring, reporting and support services, resulting in a much higher \ncost to the Exchange to provide such connectivity services.\n    Commission staff previously noted that the generation of supra-\ncompetitive profits is one of several potential factors in considering \nwhether an exchange's proposed fees are consistent with the Act.\\28\\ As \ndescribed in the Fee Guidance, the term ``supra-competitive profits'' \nrefers to profits that exceed the profits that can be obtained in a \ncompetitive market. The proposed fee structure would not result in \nexcessive pricing or supra-competitive profits for the Exchange. As \nstated above, the proposed fee structure is merely designed to permit \nthe Exchange to cover some of the costs allocated to providing \nconnectivity services. Thus, the Exchange believes that its proposed \npricing for Connectivity Fees is fair, reasonable, and equitable. \nAccordingly, the Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with \nSection 6(b)(4) of the Act because the proposed fees will permit \nrecovery of the Exchange's costs and will not result in excessive \npricing or supra-competitive profit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ See Fee Guidance, supra note 13 [sic].\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The proposed fees for connectivity services will allow the Exchange \nto cover a portion of costs incurred by the Exchange for offering \nconnectivity to Members and non-Members. As detailed above, the \nExchange has numerous internal and third-party expenses associated with \nproviding connectivity, including maintaining necessary hardware and \nother network infrastructure as well as network monitoring and support \nservices; without such hardware, infrastructure, monitoring and support \nthe Exchange would be unable to offer the connectivity services. \nFurther, the Exchange routinely works with MEMX Technologies to improve \nthe performance of the network's hardware and software. The costs \nassociated with maintaining and enhancing a state-of-the-art exchange \nnetwork is a significant portion of the overall expense of the \ntechnology provider's services, and thus the Exchange believes that it \nis reasonable and appropriate to help offset those costs by adopting \nfees for connectivity services. The Exchange's Cost Analysis estimates \nthe monthly costs to provide connectivity services at approximately \n$600,000. Based on connectivity services usage as of May 1st, 2025, as \nwell as projected use through the remainder of the year, the Exchange \nwould generate monthly revenues for 2025 of approximately $475,000, \nwhich will result in a loss for the Exchange. Even if the Exchange \nearns that amount or incrementally more, the Exchange believes the \nproposed fees for connectivity services\n\n[[Page 22352]]\n\nare fair and reasonable because they will not result in excessive \npricing or supra-competitive profit, when comparing the total expense \nof LTSE associated with providing connectivity services versus the \ntotal projected revenue of the Exchange associated with network \nconnectivity services.\n    The Exchange notes that another exchange offers similar \nconnectivity options to market participants and that the Exchange's \nproposed connectivity fees are lower.\\29\\ The Exchange further notes \nthat this exchange charges for all logical connectivity sessions and \ndoes not offer the three free sessions per month the Exchange is \nproposing to offer.\\30\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ See, e.g., the MEMX Connectivity fee schedule, available \nat: <a href=\"https://info.memxtrading.com/connectivity-fees/\">https://info.memxtrading.com/connectivity-fees/</a>.\n    \\30\\ See id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In conclusion, the Exchange submits that its proposed fee structure \nsatisfies the requirements of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act \n\\31\\ for the reasons discussed above in that it provides for the \nequitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among \nits Members and other persons using its facilities, does not permit \nunfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers, \nand is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to \nremove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open \nmarket and a national market system and in general to protect investors \nand the public interest, particularly as the proposal neither targets \nnor will it have a disparate impact on any particular category of \nmarket participant.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\31\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes that the Cost Analysis was based on the \nExchange's first year of outsourcing the LTSE trading system and \ncertain associated services and projections. As such, the Exchange \nbelieves that its costs will remain relatively similar in future years. \nIt is possible however that such costs will either decrease or \nincrease. To the extent the Exchange sees growth in use of connectivity \nservices it will receive additional revenue to offset future cost \nincreases. However, if use of connectivity services is static or \ndecreases, the Exchange might not realize the revenue that it \nanticipates or needs in order to cover applicable costs. Accordingly, \nthe Exchange is committing to conduct a one-year review after \nimplementation of these fees. The Exchange expects that it may propose \nto adjust fees at that time, to increase fees in the event that \nrevenues fail to cover costs and a reasonable mark-up of such costs. \nSimilarly, the Exchange would propose to decrease fees in the event \nthat revenue materially exceeds our current projections. In addition, \nthe Exchange will periodically conduct a review to inform its decision \nmaking on whether a fee change is appropriate (e.g., to monitor for \ncosts increasing/decreasing or subscribers increasing/decreasing, etc. \nin ways that suggest the then-current fees are becoming dislocated from \nthe prior cost-based analysis) and would propose to increase fees in \nthe event that revenues fail to cover its costs and a reasonable mark-\nup, or decrease fees in the event that revenue or the mark-up \nmaterially exceeds our current projections. In the event that the \nExchange determines to propose a fee change, the results of a timely \nreview, including an updated cost estimate, will be included in the \nrule filing proposing the fee change. More generally, we believe that \nit is appropriate for an exchange to refresh and update information \nabout its relevant costs and revenues in seeking any future changes to \nfees, and the Exchange commits to do so.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\\32\\ the Exchange \ndoes not believe that the proposed rule change would impose any burden \non competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of \nthe purposes of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntramarket Competition\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change to \nestablish connectivity fees would place certain market participants at \nthe Exchange at a relative disadvantage compared to other market \nparticipants because the proposed connectivity pricing is associated \nwith relative usage of the Exchange by each market participant and does \nnot impose a barrier to entry to smaller participants. The Exchange \nbelieves its proposed pricing is reasonable and lower than what another \nexchange charges and, when coupled with the availability of third-party \nproviders that also offer connectivity solutions, that participation on \nthe Exchange is affordable for all market participants, including \nsmaller trading firms. As described above, the connectivity services \npurchased by market participants typically increase based on their \nadditional message traffic and/or the complexity of their operations. \nThe market participants that utilize more connectivity services \ntypically utilize the most bandwidth, and those are the participants \nthat consume the most resources from the network. Accordingly, the \nproposed fees for connectivity services do not favor certain categories \nof market participants in a manner that would impose a burden on \ncompetition; rather, the allocation of the proposed fees for \nconnectivity reflects the network resources consumed by the various \nsize of market participants and the costs to the Exchange of providing \nsuch connectivity services.\nIntermarket Competition\n    The Exchange does not believe the proposed fees for connectivity to \nLTSE place an undue burden on competition on other SROs that is not \nnecessary or appropriate. Additionally, another exchange has similar \nconnectivity alternatives for their participants, but with higher rates \nto connect.\\33\\ The Exchange is also unaware of any assertion that the \nproposed fees for connectivity services would somehow unduly impair its \ncompetition with other exchanges. In sum, LTSE's proposed fees for \nconnectivity for Members and non-Members are comparable to and \ngenerally lower than fees charged by another exchange for the same or \nsimilar services.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\33\\ See supra note 31 [sic].\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    This proposed rule change establishes dues, fees or other charges \namong its members and, as such, may take effect upon filing with the \nCommission pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act \\34\\ and \nparagraph (f)(2) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.\\35\\ Accordingly, the \nproposed rule change would take effect upon filing with the Commission.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\34\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii).\n    \\35\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule \nchange, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend the rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that the action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \nwould otherwise further the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings\n\n[[Page 22353]]\n\nto determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or \ndisapproved.\n\nIV. Solicitation of Comments\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and \narguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with the Act.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange offers two standard proprietary market data products, \nthe ToM data feed and the PLF data feed. The ToM data feed is a data \nfeed that contains the Exchange's best bid and offer, with aggregate \nsize, and last sale information, based on order and quoting interest on \nthe Exchange.\\4\\ The ToM data feed includes data that is identical to \nthe data sent to the processor for the Options Price Reporting \nAuthority (``OPRA''). The data for ToM and OPRA leave the System \\5\\ at \nthe same time, as required under Section 5.2(c)(iii)(B) of the Limited \nLiability Company Agreement of the Options Price Reporting Authority \nLLC (the ``OPRA Plan''), which prohibits the dissemination of \nproprietary information on any more timely basis than the same \ninformation is furnished to the OPRA system for inclusion in OPRA's \nconsolidated dissemination of options information. The PLF data feed \nincludes full order book data for orders on the MIAX Pearl Book \\6\\ and \nincludes the following data: origin, limit price, side, size, and time-\nin-force (e.g., day, GTC).\\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 79913 (February 1, \n2017), 82 FR 9617 (February 7, 2017) (SR-PEARL-2017-01) (Notice of \nFiling and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change To \nEstablish MIAX PEARL Top of Market (``ToM'') and MIAX PEARL \nLiquidity Feed (``PLF'') Data Products).\n    \\5\\ The term ``System'' means the automated trading system used \nby the Exchange for the trading of securities. See Exchange Rule \n100.\n    \\6\\ The term ``Book'' means the electronic book of buy and sell \norders and quotes maintained by the System. See Exchange Rule 100.\n    \\7\\ See supra note 4. A Good `til Cancelled or ``GTC'' Order is \nan order to buy or sell which remains in effect until it is either \nexecuted, cancelled or the underlying option expires. See Exchange \nRule 516(i).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22354]]\n\n    Section 6 of the Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees, provides fees for \nboth the ToM and PLF data feeds. Currently, the Exchange only charges \nmonthly fees to both Internal and External Distributors (proposed \ndefinitions below) of the ToM and PLF data feeds. Specifically, the \nExchange charges Internal Distributors a monthly fee of $500.00 for the \nToM data feed and $1,250.00 for the PLF data feed. The Exchange also \ncharges External Distributors a monthly fee of $750.00 for the ToM data \nfeed and $1,500.00 for the PLF feed. The fees levels have remained \nunchanged since they were first implemented on March 1, 2018.\\8\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 82867 (March 13, \n2018), 83 FR 12044 (March 19, 2018) (SR-PEARL-2018-07).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange now proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to, among other \nthings, adopt new fee categories for the Exchange's proprietary market \ndata feeds. The primary purpose of this proposal is to adopt per User \n(defined below) fees as well as fees for Non-Display Usage (also \ndefined below). The Exchange also proposes to add a ``Market Data \nDefinitions'' section to Section 6 of the Fee Schedule as well as \nmodify how mid-month subscriptions for Distributors are to be handled. \nThe Exchange believes that adopting the same fee structure as its \naffiliated exchanges would reduce administrative burdens on market data \nsubscribers that also currently subscribe to market data feeds from the \nExchange's affiliates. Each of these proposed changes are described \nbelow.\n* * * * *\n    The Exchange believes that exchanges, in setting fees of all types, \nshould meet very high standards of transparency to demonstrate why each \nnew fee or fee increase meets the requirements of the Act that fees be \nreasonable, equitably allocated, not unfairly discriminatory, and not \ncreate an undue burden on competition among Members \\9\\ and markets. \nThe Exchange believes this high standard is especially important when \nan exchange imposes various fees for market participants to access an \nexchange's market data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization that \nis registered with the Exchange pursuant to Chapter II of these \nRules for purposes of trading on the Exchange as an ``Electronic \nExchange Member'' or ``Market Maker.'' Members are deemed \n``members'' under the Exchange Act. See Exchange Rule 100.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Approximately 48% of Members subscribe to one or both of the market \ndata feeds from the Exchange. Of those Members, 55% subscribe to both \nmarket data feeds, and the remaining 45% subscribe to only the PLF data \nfeed. The Exchange notes that there is no requirement that any Member \nor market participant subscribe to the ToM or PLF data feeds offered by \nthe Exchange. Instead, a Member may choose to maintain subscriptions to \nthe ToM or PLF data feeds based on their own business needs and trading \nmodels.\nDefinitions\n    The Exchange proposes to include a Definitions section at the \nbeginning of Section 6, Market Data Fees, of the Fee Schedule. The \npurpose of the Definitions section is to provide market participants \ngreater clarity and transparency regarding the applicability of fees by \ndefining certain terms used in connection with market data feeds within \nthe Fee Schedule in a single location related to the Exchange's market \ndata products. The Exchange notes that it includes similar Definitions \nin its fee schedule applicable to its own equity trading platform, MIAX \nPearl Equities,\\10\\ and that each of the proposed definitions are based \non the MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule and that of other exchanges. \nThe Exchange believes that including a Definitions section for market \ndata products makes the Fee Schedule more user-friendly and \ncomprehensive.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Fees, and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 (June 12, \n2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).

A Distributor that receives the \nExchange data product and then distributes that data to a third party \nor one or more Users outside the Distributor's own entity.\n    <bullet> Internal Distributor. A Distributor that receives the \nExchange data product and then distributes that data to one or more \nUsers within the Distributor's own entity.\n    [cir] The Exchange notes that it proposes to use the phrase ``own \nentity'' in the definition of Internal Distributor and External \nDistributor because a Distributor would be permitted to share data \nreceived from an exchange data product to other legal entities \naffiliated with the Distributor's entity that have been disclosed to \nthe Exchange without such distribution being considered external to a \nthird party. For instance, if a company has multiple affiliated broker-\ndealers under the same holding company, that company could have one of \nthe broker-dealers or a non-broker-dealer affiliate subscribe to an \nexchange data product and then share the data with other affiliates \nthat have a need for the data. This sharing with affiliates would not \nbe considered external distribution to a third party but instead would \nbe considered internal distribution to data recipients within the \nDistributor's own entity.\n    [cir] The Exchange also notes that the explanatory paragraph under \nboth the ToM and PLF data feed fee tables includes the following \nlanguage which defines the terms Distributor, Internal Distributors, \nand External Distributors:\n    MIAX Pearl will assess Market Data Fees applicable to ToM on \nInternal and External Distributors in each month the Distributor is \ncredentialed to use ToM in the production environment. A Distributor of \nMIAX Pearl data is any entity that receives a feed or file of data \neither directly from MIAX Pearl or indirectly through another entity \nand then distributes it either internally (within that entity) or \nexternally (outside that entity). All Distributors are required to \nexecute a MIAX Pearl Distributor Agreement.\n    The Exchange proposes to remove these provisions from the Fee \nSchedule because they: (i) duplicate the proposed definitions of \nDistributor, External Distributor, and External Distributor proposed \nherein with no substantive difference; and (ii) provide details that \nare included in the Exchange's market data policies that are also not \nalso provided for in the fee schedules of other options exchanges.\\11\\ \nRemoving these provisions would also harmonize the definition and fee \ndescriptions with its fee schedule applicable to MIAX Pearl \nEquities.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options, Market Data Fees section, both available at \n<a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/?_gl=1*19q7zz0*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjY5OTA0NzE4LjE3MzQ1MzQzODk.*_ga_5Q99WB9X71*MTczNDUzNzQ0Mi4yLjEuMTczNDUzNzQ5OC4wLjAuMA\">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/?_gl=1*19q7zz0*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjY5OTA0NzE4LjE3MzQ1MzQzODk.*_ga_5Q99WB9X71*MTczNDUzNzQ0Mi4yLjEuMTczNDUzNzQ5OC4wLjAuMA</a>.

The Exchange also only currently \ncharges External Distributors a monthly fee of $750.00 for the ToM data \nfeed and $1,500.00 for the PLF data feed. Again, these fees levels have \nremained unchanged since they were first implemented on March 1, \n2018.\\13\\ The Exchange now proposes to charge the below per User fees \nas well as Non-Display Usage fees for the ToM and PLF data feeds, \nwhich, the Exchange believes are generally similar to or lower than \nmarket data fees charged by other similarly situated options exchanges. \nThe Exchange does not propose to adopt any additional fee categories in \nthis proposal. Each of the below capitalized terms are defined above \nand would be included under the proposed Definitions section under \nSection 6, Market Data Fees, of the Fee Schedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See supra note 8.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    1. User Fees. For the ToM and PLF data feeds, the Exchange proposes \nto charge a monthly fee of $20.00 for each Professional User and $1.00 \nfor each Non-Professional User of each data feed.\\14\\ The proposed User \nfees would apply to each person that has access to the ToM or PLF data \nfeed that is provided by a Distributor (either Internal or External) \nfor displayed usage. Each Distributor's User count would include every \nindividual that has accesses to the data regardless of the purpose for \nwhich the individual uses the data. The above Professional or Non-\nProfessional User fee would provide the same Professional or Non-\nProfessional User access to all other Pearl Options Market Data feeds \nfor no additional per User charge.\\15\\ In other words, a User would \nreceive access to both the ToM and PLF data feeds for the applicable \nsingle per User fee and not have to pay separate per User fees for each \ndata feed. As such, Distributors should report the number of Users per \nthe Exchange, and not per individual data feed. This would be noted in \nSection 6 of the Fee Schedule under footnote 1 following the fee tables \nfor both the ToM and PLF data feeds. Distributors of the ToM or PLF \ndata feed would be required to report all Professional and Non-\nProfessional Users in accordance with the following:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ The Exchange does not propose to adopt an Enterprise Fee at \nthis time and may do so in the future based on feedback from market \nparticipants.\n    \\15\\ The Exchange notes that similar reporting is required by \nthe Nasdaq options markets, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq \nOptions''), Nasdaq Phlx LLC (``Nasdaq Phlx''), and Nasdaq MRX, LLC \n(``Nasdaq MRX''). See, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions\">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions</a> (providing that ``[t]he monthly \nuser fee should be reported once for Nasdaq Options, not once per \ndatafeed'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> In connection with a Distributor's distribution of the ToM \nor PLF data feed, the Distributor must count as one User each unique \nUser that the Distributor is entitled for access to the ToM or PLF data \nfeed.\n    <bullet> Distributors must report each unique individual person who \nreceives access through multiple devices or multiple methods (e.g., a \nsingle User has multiple passwords and user identifications) as one \nUser.\n    <bullet> If a Distributor entitles one or more individuals to use \nthe same device, the Distributor must include only the individuals, and \nnot the device, in the count. Thus, Distributors would not be required \nto report User device counts associated with a User's display use of \nthe data feed.\n    2. Non-Display Usage Fees. The Exchange proposes to establish a \nmonthly Non-Display Usage \\16\\ fee of $1,500.00 for the ToM data feed. \nThe Exchange also proposes to establish a monthly Non-Display Usage fee \nof $1,500.00 for the PLF data feed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ Non-Display Usage would include trading uses such as high \nfrequency or algorithmic trading as well as any trading in any asset \nclass, automated order or quote generation and/or order pegging, \nprice referencing for smart order routing, operations control \nprograms, investment analysis, order verification, surveillance \nprograms, risk management, compliance, and portfolio management.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> The Exchange proposes to provide a discount to those that \nsubscribe to both the ToM and PLF data feeds by capping the Non-Display \nUsage fee for Subscribers of both the ToM and PLF data feeds at \n$2,500.00. This would be noted in Section 6 of the Fee Schedule under \nfootnote 2 following the fee tables for both the ToM and PLF data \nfeeds.\n    Lastly, the Exchange proposes to no longer pro-rate fees for \nDistributors who subscribe or terminate mid-month. The Exchange notes \nthat there were no mid-month subscriptions or terminations over the \npast twelve (12) months that would have required the monthly fee to be \npro-rated. The Exchange also notes that mid-month subscriptions and \nterminations place an increased burden on Exchange staff and systems \nthat are in place to pro-rate the monthly fee that are not justified by \nthe little to no mid-month subscriptions and terminations that occurred \nover the past year or that the Exchange anticipates going forward based \non its past experience. This portion of the proposal should also \nencourage subscribers to either begin a new subscription or terminate \nan existing subscription at the beginning or end of a month, \nrespectively. Lastly, removing these provisions would also harmonize \nthe MIAX Pearl Options Fee Schedule with the MIAX Pearl Equities Fee \nSchedule, which also does not provide for pro-ration.\\17\\ Also, other \nexchanges do not provide for the similar pro-ration of market data \nfees.\\18\\ Therefore, the Exchange proposes to remove the following \nlanguage providing for pro-rated month fees for mid-month subscribers \nfrom the explanatory paragraph under both the ToM and PLF data feed fee \ntables:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Fees, and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 (June 12, \n2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n    \\18\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule and Cboe EDGX Options Fee \nSchedule, supra note 11.

Such new Distributors \nwill be assessed a pro-rata percentage of the fees described above, \nwhich is the percentage of the number of trading days remaining in \nthe affected calendar month as of the date on which they have been \ncredentialed to use [ToM/PLF] in the production environment, divided \nby the total number of trading days in the affected calendar month.\nImplementation\n    The Exchange issued alerts publicly announcing the proposed fees on \nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 17, 2024.\\19\\ The fees subject to this \nproposal are immediately effective.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ See Fee Change Alert, MIAX Exchange Group--January 1, 2025 \nand March 1, 2025 Market Data Fee Changes (dated September 30, \n2024), available at <a href=\"https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/09/30/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2025-market-1?nav=all\">https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/09/30/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2025-market-1?nav=all</a> and Fee Change Alert, MIAX Exchange Group--Options \nMarkets--Reminder: January 1, 2025 and March 1, 2025 Market Data Fee \nChanges (dated December 17, 2024), available at <a href=\"https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/12/17/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-reminder-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2?nav=all\">https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/12/17/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-reminder-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2?nav=all</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent \nwith the provisions of Section 6(b) \\20\\ of the Act in general, and \nfurthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) \\21\\ of the Act, in \nparticular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable \nallocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its Members \nand other persons using its facilities. Additionally, the Exchange \nbelieves that the proposed fees are consistent with the objectives of \nSection 6(b)(5) \\22\\ of the Act in that they are designed to promote \njust and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and \ncoordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, \nprocessing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions \nin securities, to remove impediments to a free and open market and \nnational market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the \npublic interest, and, particularly, are not designed to permit unfair \ndiscrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f.\n    \\21\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n    \\22\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes that the ToM and PLF data feeds are entirely \noptional. The Exchange is not required to make the ToM or PLF data \nfeeds available to any customers, nor is any customer required to \npurchase the ToM or PLF data feeds.\nThe Proposed Fees Are Reasonable and Comparable to the Fees Charged by \nOther Exchanges for Similar Data Products\n    Overall. The proposed fees are comparable to those of other options \nexchanges. Based on publicly-available information, no single exchange \nhad more than 13.65% equity options market share for all of 2024,\\23\\ \nand the Exchange compared the fees proposed herein to the fees charged \nby other options exchanges with similar market share. A more detailed \ndiscussion of the comparison follows.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ See The OCC, Options Volume by Exchange--2024, available at \n<a href=\"https://www.theocc.com/market-data/market-data-reports/volume-and-open-interest/volume-by-exchange\">https://www.theocc.com/market-data/market-data-reports/volume-and-open-interest/volume-by-exchange</a> (last visited May 5, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange assesses the market share for each of the below \nreferenced options markets utilizing total equity options contracts \ntraded in 2024, as set forth in the following charts: \\24\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ Market share is the percentage of volume on a particular \nexchange relative to the total volume across all exchanges, and \nindicates the amount of order flow directed to that exchange. High \nlevels of market share enhance the value of trading and ports. Total \ncontracts include both multi-list options and proprietary options \nproducts. Proprietary options products are products with \nintellectual property rights that are not multi-listed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Fees\n    The proposed per User fees for the Exchange's market data products \nare comparable to those charged by Nasdaq Options, Nasdaq MRX, Cboe BZX \nOptions, and Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc. (``Cboe C2''), as summarized in the \ntable below.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              Monthly            Monthly non-\n             Exchange              Market share *  Market data product   professional user    professional user\n                                         (%)                                    fee                  fee\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMIAX Pearl Options...............            4.19  All................  $20.00 (per          $1.00 (per\n                                                                         Exchange).

Nasdaq Options, with a market share of \napproximately 5.45% that is comparable to the Exchange, charges higher \nor comparable Professional and Non-Professional User fees for its top \nof book and depth of book feeds than proposed by the Exchange. Further, \nlike Nasdaq Options, the Exchange proposes to charge a single per User \nfee that would provide access to all of its market data products for a \nsingle fee.\n    The Nasdaq Options Best of Nasdaq Options (``BONO'') feed is an \noptions feed that provides Nasdaq Options' best bid and offer and last \nsale information.\\25\\ The Nasdaq Options BONO feed is similar to the \nExchange's ToM feed. The Nasdaq Options ITCH to Trade Options \n(``ITTO'') feed is an options feed that provides full order and quote \ndepth information for individual orders and quotes and last sale \ninformation.\\26\\ ITTO also provides, among other things, product \n(option series) available for trading on Nasdaq Options, the trading \nstatus of such products (i.e., whether the series is available for \nclosing transactions only), and order imbalances on opening/reopenings. \nThe ITTO feed is similar to the Exchange's PLF feed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ See Nasdaq Options Rules, Options 3, Section 23(a)(2).\n    \\26\\ See Nasdaq Options Rules, Options 3, Section 23(a)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Nasdaq Options charges Professional Users $40.10 per month and Non-\nProfessional Users $1.00 per month for the BONO feed and ITTO feed.\\27\\ \nThe Exchange proposes to charge less than\n\n[[Page 22357]]\n\nNasdaq Options for Professional Users and the same as Nasdaq Options \nfor Non-Professional Users while also providing access to all of its \nmarket data feeds for a single per User fee. Specifically, for both the \nToM and PLF data feeds, the Exchange proposes to charge Professional \nUsers $20.00 per month and Non-Professional Users $1.00 per month. The \nExchange's proposed Professional User fee is lower than Nasdaq Options \nand its Non-Professional User fee is equal to Nasdaq Options. Despite \nhaving incrementally higher market share than the Exchange, Nasdaq \nOptions charges higher or comparable per User fees than proposed by the \nExchange herein.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\27\\ See Price List--U.S. Derivatives Data, available at <a href=\"https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions\">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions</a>.

Nasdaq MRX, with a market share of approximately 2.71%, \nlower than the Exchange, charges higher Professional and Non-\nProfessional User fees for its top of book and depth of book feeds than \nthe fees proposed by the Exchange. Further, like Nasdaq MRX, the \nExchange proposes to charge a single per User fee that would provide \naccess to all of its market data products for a single fee.\\28\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ The Exchange notes that Nasdaq MRX also offers the Nasdaq \nMRX Order Feed and Nasdaq MRX Trades Feed, which are included in the \nNasdaq MRX per User fees. See Nasdaq MRX Options Rules, Options 7, \nPricing Schedule, Section 7, Market Data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Nasdaq MRX Top of Market feed is an options feed that provides \nNasdaq MRX's best bid and offer and last sale information.\\29\\ The \nNasdaq MRX Top of Market feed is similar to the Exchange's ToM feed. \nThe Nasdaq MRX Depth of Market feed is an options feed that provides \nfull order and quote depth information for individual orders and quotes \nand last sale information.\\30\\ The Nasdaq MRX Depth of Market feed is \nsimilar to the Exchange's PLF feed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ See Nasdaq MRX Options Rules, Options 3, Section 23(a)(3).\n    \\30\\ See Nasdaq MRX Options Rules, Options 3, Section 23(a)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Nasdaq MRX charges Professional Users $25.25 per month and Non-\nProfessional Users $1.00 per month for the Nasdaq MRX Top of Market \nfeed and the Nasdaq MRX Depth of Market Feed.\\31\\ The Exchange proposes \nto charge less than Nasdaq MRX for Professional Users and the same as \nNasdaq MRX for Non-Professional Users while also providing access to \nall of its market data fees for single per User fee. Specifically, for \nboth the ToM and PLF data feeds, the Exchange proposes to charge \nProfessional Users $20.00 per month and Non-Professional Users $1.00 \nper month. The Exchange's proposed Professional User fee is lower than \nNasdaq MRX and its Non-Professional User fee is equal to Nasdaq MRX. \nDespite having lower market share than the Exchange, Nasdaq MRX charges \nhigher or comparable per User fees than the fees proposed by the \nExchange herein.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\31\\ See Price List--U.S. Derivatives Data, available at <a href=\"https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions\">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe BZX Options. Cboe BZX Options, with a market share of \napproximately 3.99%, which is comparable to the Exchange's market \nshare, charges higher Professional and Non-Professional User fees for \nits depth of book feed than the fees proposed by the Exchange. Further, \nCboe BZX Options also charges separate per User fees per data product, \nwhereas the Exchange proposes to charge a single lower per User fee \nthat would provide access to all of its market data products for a \nsingle fee.\n    The Cboe BZX Options Top feed is an options feed that provides top \nof book quotations and execution information. The Cboe BZX Options Top \nfeed is similar to the Exchange's ToM feed. The Cboe BZX Options Depth \nfeed is an options feed that provides depth of book quotations and \nexecution information.\\32\\ The Cboe BZX Options Depth feed is similar \nto the Exchange's PLF feed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ For the Cboe BZX Options Top feed, Cboe BZX Option charges \nProfessional Users $5.00 per month and Non-Professional Users $0.10 \nper month. For ToM and PLF data feeds, the Exchange proposes to \ncharge Professional Users $20.00 per month and Non-Professional \nUsers $1.00 per month. Although higher, the Exchange's proposed \nProfessional and Non-Professional User fees are not necessarily \ncomparable to Cboe BZX Options Top fees because a User may receive \naccess to each of the Exchange's two data feeds for a single per \nUser fee and, unlike Cboe BZX Options, not be required to pay a \nseparate per User fee for each data product and Cboe BZX Options \nprovides two data feed that provide only Cboe BZX Options data. Cboe \nBZX Options also offers the Cboe One Options Feed, which provides \ninformation for not only Cboe BZX Options, but also its three \naffiliated options markets, Cboe EDGX Options, Cboe, and Cboe C2. \nSee Cboe BZX Options Rule 21.15 (b)(6).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe BZX Options charges Professional Users $30.00 per month and \nNon-Professional Users $1.00 per month for the Cboe BZX Options Depth \nfeed. The Exchange proposes to charge less than Cboe BZX Options and \nprovide access to all of its market data fees for single, and still \nlower, per User fee. Specifically, for both the ToM and PLF data feeds, \nthe Exchange proposes to charge Professional Users $20.00 per month and \nNon-Professional Users $1.00 per month. The Exchange's proposed \nProfessional User fee is lower than Cboe BZX Options and its Non-\nProfessional User fee is equal to Cboe BZX Options. However, both of \nthe Exchange's proposed fees can be lower than Cboe BZX Options because \na User may receive access to each of the Exchange's data feeds for a \nsingle per User fee and, unlike Cboe BZX Options, not be required to \npay a separate per User fee for each data product.\\33\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\33\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe C2. Cboe C2, with a market share of approximately 3.00% that \nis lower than the Exchange, charges higher Professional and Non-\nProfessional User fees for its C2 Options Depth feed than proposed by \nthe Exchange. Unlike Cboe C2, the Exchange proposes to charge a single \nper User fee that would provide access to all of its market data \nproducts for a single fee.\n    The Cboe C2 Options Depth feed is an options feed that provides \ndepth of book quotations and execution information. The Cboe C2 Options \nDepth feed is similar to the Exchange's PLF data feed. Cboe C2 charges \nall Users, both Professional Users and Non-Professional Users, $50.00 \nfor the Cboe C2 Options Depth feed.\\34\\ The Exchange proposes to charge \nless than Cboe C2 for Professional Users and Non-Professional Users \nwhile also providing access to all of its market data feeds for a \nsingle per User fee. Specifically, for the PLF data feed, the Exchange \nproposes to charge Professional Users $20.00 per month and Non-\nProfessional Users $1.00 per month. The Exchange's proposed \nProfessional User and Non-Professional User fees are lower than the \nfees for the Cboe C2 Options Depth feed.

Nasdaq Options, with a market share of \napproximately 5.45%, which is comparable to the Exchange's market \nshare, charges higher Non-Display Usage fees for its top of book and \ndepth of book feeds than proposed by the Exchange. Further, Nasdaq \nOptions also charges the full Non-Display Usage fees to receive all of \nits data products, whereas the Exchange proposes to cap the Non-Display \nUsage fee at $2,500.00, which would provide a discount to subscribers \nthat choose to subscribe to multiple Exchange data feeds for Non-\nDisplay Usage.\\35\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\35\\ The Exchange notes that not all options exchanges charge \nnon-display fees for options data. For example, Cboe, Cboe C2, Cboe \nEDGX Options, Cboe BZX Options, BOX, and MEMX do not charge non-\ndisplay fees. Therefore, the Exchange compared its fees to two \ncomparable exchanges, NOM and Nasdaq MRX, which charge non-display \nfees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As discussed above, the Nasdaq Options BONO feed is an options feed \nthat provides Nasdaq Options' best bid and offer and last sale \ninformation.\\36\\ The Nasdaq Options BONO feed is similar to the \nExchange's ToM data feed. The Nasdaq Options ITTO feed is an options \nfeed that provides full order and quote depth information for \nindividual orders and quotes and last sale information.\\37\\ Nasdaq \nOptions ITTO also provides, among other things, product (option series) \navailable for trading on Nasdaq Options, the trading status of such \nproducts (i.e., whether the series is available for closing \ntransactions only), and order imbalances on opening/reopenings. The \nNasdaq Options ITTO feed is similar to the Exchange's PLF data \nfeed.\\38\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\36\\ See Nasdaq Options Rules, Options 3, Section 23(a)(2).\n    \\37\\ See Nasdaq Options Rules, Options 3, Section 23(a)(1).\n    \\38\\ The Exchange proposes to cap the amount of Non-Display \nUsage fees for those that subscribe to multiple Exchange data feeds.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Nasdaq Options charges a monthly fee of $10,530.00 for Non-Display \nUsage of the Nasdaq Options BONO feed and Nasdaq Options ITTO feed.\\39\\ \nThe Exchange proposes to charge less than Nasdaq Options while also \nproposing to cap the Non-Display Usage fee at $2,500.00, which would \nprovide a discount to subscribers that choose to subscribe to multiple \nExchange data feeds for Non-Display Usage. Specifically, for both the \nToM and PLF data feeds, the Exchange proposes to charge a monthly fee \nof $1,500.00 for Non-Display Usage and to cap the Non-Display Usage fee \nat $2,500.00 for those that wish to receive both the ToM and PLF data \nfeeds for Non-Display Usage. This cap would be in lieu of paying the \nfull Non-Display Usage Fee for each data product, which would total \n$3,000.00 per month.

Nasdaq MRX, with a market share of approximately 2.71%, \nwhich is lower than the Exchange's market share, charges higher Non-\nDisplay Usage fees for its top of book and depth of book feeds than the \nfees proposed by the Exchange. Like the Exchange proposes herein, \nNasdaq MRX charges the full single Non-Display Usage fee for access to \nall of its market data feeds. The Exchange proposes to cap the Non-\nDisplay Usage fee at $2,500.00, which would provide a discount to \nsubscribers that choose to subscribe to multiple Exchange data feeds \nfor Non-Display Usage, similar to Nasdaq MRX.\n    The Nasdaq MRX Top of Market feed is an options feed that provides \nNasdaq MRX's best bid and offer and last sale information.\\40\\ The \nNasdaq MRX Top of Market feed is similar to the Exchange's ToM data \nfeed. The Nasdaq MRX Depth of Market feed is an options feed that \nprovides full order and quote depth information for individual orders \nand quotes and last sale information.\\41\\ The Nasdaq MRX Depth of \nMarket feed is similar to the Exchange's PLF data feed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\40\\ See Nasdaq MRX Options Rules, Options 3, Section 23(a)(3).\n    \\41\\ See Nasdaq MRX Options Rules, Options 3, Section 23(a)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Nasdaq MRX charges a monthly fee of $7,575.00 for Non-Display Usage \nof the Nasdaq MRX Top of Market feed and Nasdaq MRX Depth of Market \nfeed.\\42\\ The Exchange proposes to charge less than Nasdaq MRX while \nalso proposing to cap the Non-Display Usage fee at $2,500.00, which \nwould provide a discount to subscribers that choose to subscribe to \nmultiple Exchange data feeds for Non-Display Usage. Specifically, for \nboth the ToM and PLF data feeds, the Exchange proposes to charge a \nmonthly fee of $1,500.00 and to cap the Non-Display Usage fee at \n$2,500.00 for those that wish to receive both the ToM and PLF data feed \nfor Non-Display Usage. This cap would be in lieu of paying the full \nNon-Display Usage Fee for each data product, which would total \n$3,000.00 per month.

The \nbelow table also includes applicable per User and Non-Display Usage \nfees that are discussed above.\\43\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\43\\ The Exchange notes that other exchanges offer an enterprise \nlicense fee that provides access to an unlimited number of users for \na single price. This fee covers all of the applicable exchange's \nmarket data feeds for a single enterprise license fee. The Exchange \ndoes not propose to offer an enterprise license fee at this time \nbecause customers have not requested it and, at this time, no \nindividual subscriber distributes Exchange market data to a \npopulation of individual users that would necessitate purchasing an \nenterprise license.\n\n[[Page 22359]]\n\n\n\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Market\n                                    share                          Internal      External\n            Exchange              [Dagger]  Market data product  distributors  distributors        Pro-user          Non-pro user       Non-display fee\n                                     (%)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMIAX Pearl Options..............      4.19  ToM................      $500.00       $750.00   $20.00 (per          $1.00 (per          $1,500.00 (per\n                                            PLF................     1,250.00      1,500.00    Exchange).

N/A.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Dagger] See supra note 23.\n\n    As illustrated by the above table, while distributor fees may vary \nacross exchanges, and in some instances are higher on the Exchange, the \nper User fees of other exchanges are generally higher than that \nproposed by the Exchange and can quickly make up for any difference in \ndistributor fees due to an increased number of Users permissioned for \nother exchanges' data feeds when compared to the Users permissioned to \nview data from the Exchange. In addition, Nasdaq Options and Nasdaq MRX \ncharge materially higher fees for Non-Display Usage. Meanwhile, Cboe \nBZX Options and Cboe C2 would charge non-display users their applicable \ndistribution fee, which are not capped and are either higher than, or \ncomparable to, the fees proposed by the Exchange. Furthermore, the \nExchange proposes to only charge fees to Internal and External \nDistributors for the ToM and PLF feeds, which when combined with the \nabove proposed fees, result in fee packages that are generally \ncomparable to the fee packages charged by Nasdaq Options, Nasdaq MRX, \nCboe BZX Options, and Cboe C2 due to those exchanges charging higher or \nsimilar User and Non-Display Usage fees, as set forth above.\n    Lastly, the proposed discount to charge per User fees at the \nExchange level, and not per data feed, as well as capping the monthly \nNon-Display Usage fee for use of multiple data feeds, is reasonable and \ncause the Exchange's proposed fees to be even lower for subscribers to \nmultiple Exchange data products.\n    Pro-Rata Distribution of Fees. The Exchange believes its proposal \nto no longer pro-rate mid-month changes to subscriptions is reasonable \nbecause the Exchange had no mid-month subscriptions or terminations \nover the past twelve (12) months that would have required the monthly \nfee to be pro-rated and no other options exchanges provides for the \nsimilar pro-ration of market data fees.\\44\\ Also, removing these \nprovisions would harmonize the MIAX Pearl Options Fee Schedule with the \nMIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, which does not provide for pro-ration \nof market data fees.\\45\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\44\\ See Cboe BZX Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section and \nCboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, supra note 11.

The Exchange believes that its proposed fees are \nreasonable, equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory because they are \ndesigned to align fees with services provided. The Exchange believes \nthat the proposed fees for the market data feeds are allocated fairly \nand equitably among the various categories of users of the data feeds, \nand any differences among categories of users are justified and \nappropriate.\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are equitably \nallocated because they will apply uniformly to all data recipients that \nchoose to subscribe to the market data feeds. Any market participant \nthat chooses to subscribe to the market data feeds is subject to the \nsame Fee Schedule, regardless of what type of business they operate, \nand the decision to subscribe to one or more market data feeds is based \non objective differences in usage of market data feeds among different \nMembers, which are still ultimately in the control of any particular \nMember. The Exchange believes the proposed pricing of the market data \nfeeds is equitably allocated because it is based, in part, upon the \namount of information contained in each data feed, which may have \nadditional value to market participants.\n\n[[Page 22360]]\n\n    Pro-Rata Distribution of Fees. The Exchange believes its proposal \nto no longer pro-rate mid-month changes to subscriptions is equitably \nallocated because the Exchange had no subscriber utilize pro-ration via \na mid-month subscriptions or terminations over the past twelve (12) \nmonths, nor does it foresee a subscriber doing so in the near future. \nThe Exchange believes it is equitable to no longer pro-rate fees for \nDistributors who subscribe mid-month because other options exchanges do \nnot provide for the similar pro-ration of market data fees.\\46\\ Also, \nremoving these provisions would harmonize the MIAX Pearl Options Fee \nSchedule with the MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, which does not \nprovide for pro-ration of market data fees.\\47\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\46\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section, supra \nnote 11.

The Exchange believes that the proposed fee, fee levels, \nand structure that differentiate between Professional User fees from \nNon-Professional User fees for display use are equitable. This \nstructure has long been used by other exchanges and OPRA to reduce the \nprice of data to Non-Professional Users and make it more broadly \navailable.\\48\\ Offering the market data feeds to Non-Professional Users \nat a lower cost than Professional Users results in greater equity among \ndata recipients, as Professional Users are categorized as such based on \ntheir employment and participation in financial markets, and thus, are \ncompensated to participate in the markets. While Non-Professional Users \ntoo can receive significant financial benefits through their \nparticipation in the markets, the Exchange believes it is reasonable to \ncharge more to those Users who are more directly engaged in the \nmarkets.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\48\\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59544 (March \n9, 2009), 74 FR 11162 (March 16, 2009) (SR-NYSE-2008-131) \n(establishing the $15 Non-Professional User Fee (Per User) for NYSE \nOpenBook); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20002, File No. S7-\n433 (July 22, 1983), 48 FR 34552 (July 29, 1983) (establishing Non-\nProfessional fees for CTA data); NASDAQ BX Equity 7 Pricing \nSchedule, Section 123.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Non-Display Usage Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed Non-\nDisplay Usage fees are equitably allocated because they would require \nDistributors to pay fees only for the uses they actually make of the \ndata. As noted above, non-display data can be used by data recipients \nfor a wide variety of profit-generating purposes (including trading and \norder routing) as well as purposes that do not directly generate \nrevenues (such as risk management and compliance) but nonetheless \nsubstantially reduce the recipient's costs by automating certain \nfunctions. The Exchange believes that it is equitable to charge non-\ndisplay data Distributors that use the market data feeds because all \nsuch Distributors would have the ability to use such data for as many \nnon-display uses as they wish for one low fee. As noted above, this \nstructure is comparable to that in place for the exchanges referenced \nabove and several other exchanges charge multiple non-display fees to \nthe same client to the extent they use a data feed in several different \ntrading platforms or for several types of non-display use.\\49\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\49\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, available at <a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/bzx/\">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/bzx/</a> (providing fees \nof $2,000.00 to $3,000.00 for Distribution, which includes Non-\nDisplay use); Cboe C2 Fee Schedule, available at <a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/ctwo/\">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/ctwo/</a> (providing a \nfee $2,500.00 for Distribution, which includes Non-Display use); \nNasdaq Options Fee Schedule, available at, <a href=\"https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions\">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions</a> (providing a \nfee of $10,000.00 for Non-Display Use); and the NYSE American fee \nschedule available at <a href=\"https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Market_Data_Pricing.pdf\">https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Market_Data_Pricing.pdf</a> (providing a fee of $5,000.00 for Non-\nDisplay Use).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * * * *\n    For all of the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the \nproposed fees for the market data feeds are equitably allocated.\nThe Proposed Fees Are Not Unfairly Discriminatory\n    The Exchange believes the proposed fees are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory because any differences in the application of the fees \nare based on meaningful distinctions between customers, and those \nmeaningful distinctions are not unfairly discriminatory between \ncustomers.\n    Overall. The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are not \nunfairly discriminatory because they would apply to all data recipients \nthat choose to subscribe to the same market data feed(s). Any market \nparticipant, including market data vendors, that chooses to subscribe \nto the market data feeds is subject to the same Fee Schedule, \nregardless of what type of business they operate. Market participants \nseeking lower cost options may instead choose to receive data from OPRA \nor another potentially lower cost option such as a market data vendor. \nThe Exchange notes that market participants can also choose to \nsubscribe to a combination of data feeds for redundancy purposes or to \nuse different feeds for different purposes. In sum, each market \nparticipant has the ability to choose the best business solution for \nitself. The Exchange does not believe it is unfairly discriminatory to \nbase pricing upon the amount of information contained in each data feed \nand the importance of that information to market participants. As \ndescribed above, the ToM data feed can be utilized to trade on the \nExchange but contains less information than available on the PLF data \nfeed. Thus, the Exchange believes it is not unfairly discriminatory for \nthe products to be priced as proposed, with the same fees being \nproposed for each data feed coupled with the discounts and caps \ndiscussed above.\n    Pro-Rata Distribution of Fees. The Exchange believes that the \nproposal to no longer pro-rate mid-month changes to market data \nsubscriptions is not unfairly discriminatory because there were no mid-\nmonth subscriptions or terminations over the past twelve (12) months \nthat would have required the monthly fee to be pro-rated. The Exchange \nnotes that other options exchanges do not provide for the similar pro-\nration of market data fees.\\50\\ Also, removing these provisions would \nharmonize the MIAX Pearl Options Fee Schedule with the MIAX Pearl \nEquities Fee Schedule, which does not provide for pro-ration.\\51\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\50\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section, supra \nnote 11.

The Exchange believes that the proposed fee, fee levels, \nand structure that differentiates between Professional User fees from \nNon-Professional User fees for display use are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory. This structure has long been used by other exchanges \nand OPRA to reduce the price of data to Non-Professional Users and make \nit more broadly available. Offering the market data feeds to Non-\nProfessional Users with the same data as is available to Professional \nUsers, albeit at a lower cost, results in greater equity among data \nrecipients. These User fees would be charged uniformly to all \nindividuals that have access to the market data feeds based on the \ncategory of User.\n\n[[Page 22361]]\n\n    The Exchange also believes the proposed User fees are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory, with higher fees for Professional Users than Non-\nProfessional Users, because Non-Professional Users may have less \nability to pay for such data than Professional Users as well as less \nopportunity to profit from their usage of such data.\n    Non-Display Usage Fees. The Exchange believes that the proposed \nNon-Display Usage fees are not unfairly discriminatory because they \nwould require Distributors for non-display use to pay fees depending on \ntheir use of the data. As noted above, non-display data can be used by \ndata recipients for a wide variety of profit-generating purposes as \nwell as purposes that do not directly generate revenues but nonetheless \nsubstantially reduce the recipient's costs by automating certain \nfunctions.\n* * * * *\n    For all of the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the \nproposed fees for the Exchange's market data feeds are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\\52\\ the Exchange \ndoes not believe that the proposed rule change would impose any burden \non competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of \nthe purposes of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\52\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntra-Market Competition\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed fees place certain \nmarket participants at a relative disadvantage to other market \nparticipants because, as noted above, the proposed fees are associated \nwith usage of the data feed by each market participant, which are still \nultimately in the control of any particular Member, and such fees do \nnot impose a barrier to entry to smaller participants. Accordingly, the \nproposed fees do not favor certain categories of market participants in \na manner that would impose a burden on competition; rather, the \nallocation of the proposed fees reflects the types of data consumed by \nvarious market participants and their usage thereof. The Exchange also \nbelieves that the proposed fees neither favor nor penalize one or more \ncategories of market participants in a manner that would impose an \nundue burden on competition.\n    The Exchange believes its proposal to no longer pro-rate mid-month \nchanges to market data subscriptions does not place an undue burden on \nintra-market competition because all market participants will be \nsubject to the same Fee Schedule, regardless of which point in the \nmonth they subscribe. As noted above, there were no mid-month \nsubscriptions or terminations over the past twelve (12) months that \nwould have required the monthly fee to be pro-rated. The Exchange notes \nthat other options exchanges do not provide for the similar pro-ration \nof market data fees.\\53\\ Also, removing these provisions would \nharmonize the MIAX Pearl Options Fee Schedule with the MIAX Pearl \nEquities Fee Schedule, which does not provide for pro-ration.\\54\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\53\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section. See \nalso MEMX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section and \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 101370 (October 17, 2024), 89 FR \n84638 (October 23, 2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n    \\54\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Definitions and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 \n(June 12, 2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInter-Market Competition\n    The Exchange does not believe the proposed fees place an undue \nburden on competition on other SROs that is not necessary or \nappropriate. In particular, market participants are not forced to \nsubscribe to either data feed, as described above. An exchange that \noverprices its market data products stands a high risk that users may \npurchase another market's market data product. These competitive \npressures ensure that no one exchange's market data fees can impose an \nunnecessary burden on competition, and the Exchange's proposed fees do \nnot do so here. Additionally, other exchanges have similar market data \nfees with comparable rates in place for their participants. Other \noptions exchanges are free to adopt comparable fee structures subject \nto the Commission's rule filing process.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act,\\55\\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) \\56\\ thereunder. \nAt any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, \nthe Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it \nappears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate \nin the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such \naction, the Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether \nthe proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\55\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii).\n    \\56\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to adopt fees for \nDedicated Cores. The text of the proposed rule change is provided in \nExhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at \nthe Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to adopt fees for \nDedicated Cores.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange initially adopted pricing for Dedicated Cores \non July 1, 2024 (SR-CboeEDGX-2024-043). On August 1, 2024, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-051. On \nbusiness date September 30, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing \nand submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-061. On November 26, 2024, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-080. On \nJanuary 24, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted \nSR-CboeEDGX-2025-006. On March 13, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2025. On May 7, 2025, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, the Exchange recently began allowing Users \n\\4\\ to assign a Single Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') logical order entry \nport \\5\\ to a single dedicated Central Processing Unit (CPU Core) \n(``Dedicated Core''). Historically, CPU Cores had been shared by \nlogical order entry ports (i.e., multiple logical ports from multiple \nfirms may connect to a single CPU Core). Use of Dedicated Cores \nhowever, can provide reduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved \nperformance since a firm using a Dedicated Core is utilizing the full \nprocessing power of a CPU Core instead of sharing that power with other \nfirms. This offering is completely voluntary and is available to all \nUsers that wish to purchase Dedicated Cores. Users may utilize BOE \nlogical order entry ports on shared CPU Cores, either in lieu of, or in \naddition to, their use of Dedicated Core(s). As such, Users are able to \noperate across a mix of shared and dedicated CPU Cores which the \nExchange believes provides additional risk and capacity management. \nFurther, Dedicated Cores are not required nor necessary to participate \non the Exchange and as such Users may opt not to use Dedicated Cores at \nall.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ A User may be either a Member or Sponsored Participant. The \nterm ``Member'' shall mean any registered broker or dealer that has \nbeen admitted to membership in the Exchange, limited liability \ncompany or other organization which is a registered broker or dealer \npursuant to Section 15 of the Act, and which has been approved by \nthe Exchange. A Sponsored Participant may be a Member or non-Member \nof the Exchange whose direct electronic access to the Exchange is \nauthorized by a Sponsoring Member subject to certain conditions. See \nExchange Rule 11.3.\n    \\5\\ Users may currently connect to the Exchange using a logical \nport available through an application programming interface \n(``API''), such as the Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') protocol. A BOE \nlogical order entry port is used for order entry.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to assess the following monthly fees for \nUsers that wish to use Dedicated Cores and adopt a maximum limit. \nFirst, the Exchange proposes to provide up to two Dedicated Cores to \nall Users who wish to use Dedicated Cores, at no additional cost. In \nthe event that a User voluntarily chooses to use more than two \nDedicated Cores, only then would the Exchange assess the following \nfees: $650 per Dedicated Core for 3-15 Dedicated Cores; $850 per \nDedicated Core for 16-30 Dedicated Cores; and $1,050 per Dedicated Core \nfor 31 or more Dedicated Cores. The proposed fees are progressive and \nthe Exchange proposes to include the following example in the Fees \nSchedule to provide clarity as to how the fees will be applied. \nParticularly, the Exchange will provide the following example: if a \nUser were to purchase 16 Dedicated Cores, it will be charged a total of \n$9,300 per month ($0 * 2) + ($650 * 13) + ($850 * 1). The Exchange also \nproposes to make clear in the Fees Schedule that the monthly fees are \nassessed and applied in their entirety and are not prorated. The \nExchange notes the current standard fees assessed for BOE Logical \nPorts, whether used with Dedicated or shared CPU cores, will remain \napplicable and unchanged.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ The Exchange currently assesses $550 per port per month. \nPort fees will also continue to be assessed on the first two \nDedicated Cores that Users receive at no additional cost. See Cboe \nEDGX Equities Fee Schedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Since the Exchange currently has a finite amount of physical space \nin its data centers in which its servers (and therefore corresponding \nCPU Cores) are located, the Exchange also proposes to prescribe a \nmaximum limit on the number of Dedicated Cores that Users may purchase \neach month. The purpose of establishing these limits is to manage the \nallotment of Dedicated Cores in a fair manner and to prevent the \nExchange from being required to expend large amounts of limited \nresources in order to provide an unlimited number of Dedicated Cores. \nThe Exchange previously established a limit for Members of a maximum \nnumber of 60 Dedicated Cores and Sponsoring Members a limit of a \nmaximum number of 25 Dedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access \nrelationships.\\7\\ The Exchange has since been able to procure \nadditional space in its third-party data\n\n[[Page 22363]]\n\ncenter, as well as procure additional servers with CPU Cores and the \nExchange has a better understanding of User demand relative to its \navailable space since the initial launch of Dedicated Cores. After \nseeing increased User demand, the Exchange proposed to increase the cap \nand provided that Members will be limited to a maximum number of 80 \nDedicated Cores and Sponsoring Members will be limited to a maximum \nnumber of 35 Dedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access \nrelationships.\\8\\ The Exchange noted at that time that it would \ncontinue monitoring Dedicated Core interest by all Users and allotment \navailability with the goal of increasing these limits to meet Users' \nneeds if and when the demand is there and/or the Exchange is able to \naccommodate additional Dedicated Cores. Since then, the Exchange has \ndetermined that it is able to accommodate an increased cap relative to \ncurrent demand. As such, the Exchange proposed to increase the cap to \n120 Dedicated Cores for Members, effective December 1, 2024.\\9\\ \nSponsoring Members will continue to be limited to a maximum of 35 \nDedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access relationships.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100471 (July 9, \n2024) 89 FR 57454 (July 15, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGX-2024-043).\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101305 (October 10, \n2024) 89 FR 83720 (October 17, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGX-2024-061).\n    \\9\\ The prescribed maximum quantity of Dedicated Cores for \nMembers applies regardless of whether that Member purchases the \nDedicated Cores directly from the Exchange and/or through a Service \nBureau. In a Service Bureau relationship, a customer allows its MPID \nto be used on the ports of a technology provider, or Service Bureau. \nOne MPID may be allowed on several different Service Bureaus.\n    \\10\\ The fee tier(s) applicable to Sponsoring Members are \ndetermined on a per Sponsored Access relationship basis and not on \nthe combined total of Dedicated Cores across Sponsored Users. For \nexample, under the proposed changes, a Sponsoring Member that has \nthree Sponsored Access relationships is entitled to a total of 105 \nDedicated Cores for those 3 Sponsored Access relationships but would \nbe assessed fees separately based on the 35 Dedicated Cores for each \nSponsored User (instead of combined total of 105 Dedicated Cores). \nFor example, a Sponsoring Member with 3 Sponsored Access \nrelationships would pay $30,450 per month if each Sponsored Access \nrelationship purchased the maximum 35 Dedicated Cores. More \nspecifically, the Sponsoring Member would be provided 2 Dedicated \nCores at no additional cost for each Sponsored User under Tier 1 \n(total of 6 Dedicated Cores at no additional cost) and provided an \nadditional 8 Dedicated Cores at $650 each for each Sponsored User, 5 \nDedicated Cores at $850 each for each Sponsored User and 20 \nDedicated Cores at $1,050 each for each Sponsored User (combined \ntotal of 99 additional Dedicated Cores).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\11\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\12\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\13\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) \\14\\ of the Act, which \nrequires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of \nreasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other \npersons using its facilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\12\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\13\\ Id.\n    \\14\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes the proposal is reasonable because the \nExchange is offering all Users voluntarily choose wishes to utilize \nDedicated Cores up to two Dedicated Cores at no additional cost. \nNotably, of the Members that currently maintain Dedicated Cores, 20% \nmaintain only 1 or 2 Dedicated Cores and therefore pay no additional \nfees. The Exchange believes the proposed fees are reasonable because \nDedicated Cores provide a valuable service in that it can provide \nreduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved performance compared \nto use of a shared CPU Core since a firm using a Dedicated Core is \nutilizing the full processing power of a CPU Core. The Exchange also \nemphasizes however, that the use of Dedicated Cores is not necessary \nfor trading and as noted above, is entirely optional. Users can also \ncontinue to access the Exchange through shared CPU Cores at no \nadditional cost. Indeed, 36% of the Exchange's Members currently use \nDedicated Cores, and as noted above, of those who do, 20% take only 1 \nor 2 Dedicated Cores at no additional cost. Depending on a firm's \nspecific business needs, the proposal enables Users to choose to use \nDedicated Cores in lieu of, or in addition to, shared CPU Cores (or as \nemphasized, not use Dedicated Cores at all). If a User finds little \nbenefit in having Dedicated Cores based on its business model and \ntrading strategies, or determines Dedicated Cores are not cost-\nefficient for its needs or does not provide sufficient value to the \nfirm, such User may continue its use of the shared CPU Cores, \nunchanged. The Exchange is not aware of any specific reason \n(operational or otherwise) why a firm would not partake in the use of \nthe one to two free Dedicated Cores the Exchange offers. Indeed the \nExchange does not believe that the set up a firm would undertake to use \nfree Dedicated Cores offered by the Exchange is prohibitively difficult \nor burdensome; ultimately, whether or not a firm avails itself of the \nfree Dedicated Cores is a business decision, and some firms may decide \nthat the impact that Dedicated Cores may have is simply not beneficial \nor necessary to how that firm operates. The Exchange also has no plans \nto eliminate shared CPU Cores nor to require Users to purchase \nDedicated Cores.\n    The Exchange has seen general interest in Dedicated Cores from a \nvariety of market participants, with varying size and business models. \nSuch market participants include proprietary trading firms (who tend to \nbe more latency sensitive), as well as sell-side market participants \nand buy-side market participants (who tend to be less latency \nsensitive). For background, proprietary trading firms utilize their own \ncapital to trade without taking outside money from clients. Due to the \nnature of their respective businesses, the Exchange has classified \nproprietary trading firms as latency sensitive, and other groups, such \nas buy-side hedge funds, sell-side banks and sell-side non-banks (such \nas agency brokers) as non-latency sensitive. Proprietary trading firms' \nstrategies may range from, market making, to relative value trading and \narbitrage- these all rely on profiting from general market activity \nand, generally, requires faster entry and exit into trades and \npositions making proprietary trading firms more latency sensitive than \nother market segments. Buy-side hedge funds, banks and agency brokers \nare not as latency sensitive as, generally, the strategy for hedge \nfunds is based on overall long-term positioning in the market and banks \nand agency brokers may profit from commissions of customer order flow; \nboth are generally strategies that are not reliant on speed to the same \nextent proprietary trading firms are. Further, Users have various \nreasons for obtaining Dedicated Cores.\n\n[[Page 22364]]\n\nSome Users for example, may be seeking to further reduce latency or \nincreased execution determinism, whereas others may use Dedicated Cores \nas a general risk mitigation by siloing their respective activity. For \nexample, by using the Dedicated Core(s) to silo its respective \nactivity, a firm may be able to mitigate risk during periods of \nheightened volatility as the firm will not need to compete for a shared \nresource (i.e., the shared core). Of further note, only 67% of Members \nthat are propriety trading firms (who again, generally tend to be more \nlatency sensitive) utilize Dedicated Cores, and of that 67%, 25% are \nonly utilizing the 1 to 2 free Dedicated Cores available to all Users. \nAs mentioned above, some non-latency sensitive firms have chosen to \nalso adopt Dedicated Cores. 20% of Members that are not latency \nsensitive utilize Dedicated Cores, and of that 20%, 11% are only \nutilizing the 1 to 2 free Dedicated Cores available to all Users.\n    The lack of universal, or even widespread, adoption by all such \nusers therefore demonstrates that purchasing Dedicated Cores is not \neffectively a requirement to compete for any one type of market \nparticipant, including latency sensitive market participants. Instead, \nDedicated Cores are an optional and voluntary connectivity offering, \nwhich market participants are free to choose whether or not to utilize \nbased on whether they meet their unique business needs. Moreover, the \nExchange has received overwhelming positive feedback and support for \nDedicated Cores from the firms that have chosen to utilize these in \nfurtherance of their respective needs, with some Users even noting that \nthey have moved more of their order flow to the Exchange and its \naffiliated equities exchanges (the ``Equities Exchanges'') as they have \nnoticed both better fills and greater consistency of order execution at \nthe Equities Exchanges. This demonstrates that despite any incurred \ncosts for Users that choose to purchase Dedicated Cores, it is \nultimately a net win for them as they benefit from better execution. \nThe Exchange believes it also demonstrates that Users find the proposed \nfees to be both reasonable and have benefited from purchasing or, are \nalternatively benefiting from the proposed one or two free Dedicated \nCores available at no additional cost. The Exchange believes this is \nshown by both the level of demand for Dedicated Cores and the feedback \nfrom market participants that have used Dedicated Cores for its unique \nbusiness needs, including as described above. The Exchange also \nbelieves it's notable that no negative comment letters in connection \nwith the proposed pricing have been received since the Exchange first \nfiled proposed fees for Dedicated Cores back on July 1, 2024. \nAdditionally, as noted earlier, Users can (and many have) decide that \nutilizing even a free Dedicated Core is not needed for their business. \nThe Exchange also notes it has not received any feedback for Users that \nraise concerns over the barrier to entry to use Dedicated Cores, \nincluding notably the free Dedicated Cores- nor is the Exchange aware \nof any reason why a firm would ultimately choose not to use the free \nDedicated Cores, other than it is not necessary for its business. \nUltimately, this is a business decision that each User must make and is \nbest suited to determine and will ultimately depend on the priorities \nand strategies of that User's respective business needs.\n    The Exchange also notes that at least one other exchange also has a \ncomparable offering.\\15\\ The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (``Nasdaq''), \nintroduced the Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure in 2014 \\16\\ which \nallows a member firm to assign up to 30 of its OUCH ports to a \ndedicated server infrastructure for its exclusive use.\\17\\ The \nDedicated OUCH server handles only the subscribing member firm's \nmessage traffic sent through their ports on the Dedicated OUCH to \nNasdaq's system.\\18\\ Similarly, as previously described, a Dedicated \nCore only handles that subscribing firm's messaging activity. Nasdaq \nnotes that with its Dedicated OUCH offering, member firms can develop a \ntailored solution by controlling their message traffic in order to \noptimize their trading strategies.\\19\\ As described above with \nDedicated Cores, one of the benefits is greater execution determinism \nas subscribers only need to account for their order flow when using a \nDedicated Core, similar to the existing Nasdaq Dedicated OUCH offering. \nIn addition to using Dedicated Cores and Dedicated OUCH for the purpose \nof greater execution determinism, firms may also use either offering \nfor greater risk mitigation as, with either offering, the subscribing \nfirm only needs to take their specific messaging traffic into account. \nNasdaq notes as well that its Dedicated OUCH offering is wholly \noptional and therefore member firms are not compelled to subscribe and \nthat its offering is pro-competitive as it adds an additional \nconnectivity option available to Nasdaq members.\\20\\ Similar to the \nDedicated OUCH offering, the Exchange has noted that no User is \nrequired to purchase or to use the two free Dedicated Cores offered to \nall Users.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market, Equity 7 Pricing Schedule, \nSection 115(g)(3), Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure.\n    \\16\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 70693 (October 16, \n2013), 78 FR 62761 (October 22, 2013) (SR-NASDAQ-2013-131).\n    \\17\\ See supra note 15.\n    \\18\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 70036 (July 25, \n2013), 78 FR 45993 (July 30, 2013) (SR-NASDAQ-2013-097).\n    \\19\\ Id.\n    \\20\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Despite these similarities, there are some differences. \nSpecifically, with the Nasdaq OUCH offering, a member firm would need \nto purchase an entire server, of which, 30 OUCH ports could be utilized \non the Dedicated OUCH server--a participant may purchase up to four \nDedicated OUCH servers based on its needs.\\21\\ In contrast, the \nExchange's offering allows for a purchase by cores (as opposed to an \nentire server), allowing a participant to more efficiently scale its \nbusiness by purchasing only the number of cores that it needs. \nUltimately, the Exchange's offering is more akin to a service offering \nwhile the Nasdaq offering is more akin to an infrastructure offering \n(and as such, the pricing structure does differ)--both offerings better \nenable a firm to utilize the full processing power of a CPU Core.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ See https://nasdaqtrader.com/\nTrader.aspx?id=OUCH#:~:text=Each%20server%20can%20house%20up%20to%20a\n%20maximum,Nasdaq%20Market%20Sales%20at%20%2B1%20800%20846%200477.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    A Dedicated OUCH Port Infrastructure subscription is available to a \nmember firm for a fee of $5,000 per month, which is in addition to the \nstandard fees assessed for each OUCH port. A one-time installation fee \nof $5,000 is assessed to subscribers for each Dedicated OUCH Port \nServer subscription.\\22\\ In contrast, the Exchange offers 1-2 Dedicated \nCores at no cost, making this widely available to any participant who \nmay find a benefit from using this offering. Additionally, by the \nExchange not charging an installation fee upfront, participants are \nable to try the offering at no cost, by receiving up to two Dedicated \nCores at no cost to the User. The Exchange's model allows for \nwidespread participation by all who wish to use Dedicated Cores--the \nsteep initial cost of Nasdaq's model of spending, at a minimum, $10,000 \nfor the first month requires a heavy investment, which in the case of \nsmaller participants, may not be feasible. In contrast, the Exchange's \nmodel of providing up to two Dedicated Cores at no cost, allows \nparticipants to\n\n[[Page 22365]]\n\neasily utilize this service if they believe it is helpful for their \nbusiness needs. Moreover, the Exchange's service offering also provides \nmore Users with more modest CPU capacity needs a zero-cost option, as \nwell as the ability to buy only as many Dedicated Cores that they need, \nwhereas Nasdaq's Dedicated OUCH offering requires a User to buy all \ncores offered on a single server (even if a firm does not have the \ncorresponding full amount of 30 ports), with no discounted or fee \nwaiver for the first two cores, as well as no ability to buy fewer \ncores than necessary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market Rulebook, Equity 7 Pricing \nSchedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Lastly, the Exchange emphasizes that order processing itself is not \naffected by the introduction of Dedicated Cores. No relevant changes \nare intended to the matching engine, which is, and remains, the main \ncomponent of the Exchange's infrastructure being responsible for the \nactual processing of orders. While Users of Dedicated Cores may notice \na latency reduction, this is an inherent byproduct of introducing \nimproved technology.\\23\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ Moreover, there has been a longstanding history of \nexchanges providing enhanced technology where the latency reduction \nthat follows is a natural result. For example, other exchanges may \noffer a variety of co-location services where subscribers of these \nservices may benefit from lower latency based on the specific \noffering they choose based on their business needs. See e.g., The \nNasdaq Stock Market General 8 Connectivity, Section 1 Co-Location \nServices (demonstrating a range of cabinet offerings).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes that the proposed Dedicated Core fees \nare equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because they continue to \nbe assessed uniformly to similarly situated Users in that all Users who \nchoose to purchase Dedicated Cores will be subject to the same proposed \ntiered fee schedule. Moreover, all Users are entitled to up to 2 \nDedicated Cores at no additional cost and as previously discussed, 20% \nof all Members that take Dedicated Cores (including both latency \nsensitive and non-latency sensitive Members) take only 1 or 2 Dedicated \nCores at no additional cost. The Exchange believes the proposed \nascending fee structure is also reasonable, equitable and not unfairly \ndiscriminatory as it is designed so that firms that use a higher \nallotment of the Exchange's finite number of Dedicated Cores pay higher \nrates, rather than placing that burden on market participants that have \nmore modest needs who will have the flexibility of obtaining Dedicated \nCores at lower price points in the lower tiers. As such, the proposed \nfees do not favor certain categories of market participants in a manner \nthat would impose a burden on competition; rather, the ascending fee \nstructure reflects the (finite) resources consumed by the various needs \nof market participants--that is, the lowest Dedicated Core consuming \nUsers pay the least, and highest Dedicated Core consuming Users pay the \nmost. The Exchange believes that such pricing further creates a lower \nbarrier to entry for all Users, making this service widely available to \nall who deem it helpful for their business, including those with more \nmodest needs. Other exchanges similarly assess higher fees to those \nthat consume more Exchange resources.\\24\\ Moreover, those consuming \nmore Dedicated Cores do so if they find a benefit in having higher \nquantities of Dedicated Cores based on their respective business needs. \nThe proposed tier structure is also designed to encourage firms to \nmanage their needs in a fair manner and to prevent the Exchange from \nbeing required to expend large amounts of limited resources in order to \nprovide an additional number of Dedicated Cores or put the Exchange in \na position that it cannot accommodate demand. Moreover, as discussed \nabove and in more detail below, the Exchange cannot currently offer an \nunlimited number of Dedicated Cores due in part to physical space \nconstraints in the third-party data center. The Exchange believes the \nproposed ascending fee structure is therefore another appropriate \nmeans, in conjunction with an established cap, to manage this finite \nresource and ensure the resource is apportioned more fairly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ See e.g., Cboe U.S. Options Fee Schedule, BZX Options, \nOptions Logical Port Fees, Ports with Bulk Quoting Capabilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes it is reasonable to limit the number of \nDedicated Cores Users can purchase because the Exchange has a finite \namount of space in its third-party data centers to accommodate CPU \ncores, including Dedicated Cores. The Exchange must also take into \naccount timing and cost considerations in procuring additional \nDedicated Cores and related hardware such as servers, switches, optics \nand cables, as well as the readiness of the Exchange's data center \nspace to accommodate additional Dedicated Cores in the Exchange's \nrespective Order Handler Cabinets.\\25\\ Moreover, procuring data center \nspace has grown to be more challenging than it was five years ago with \nthe increased demand for data center space. For example, the U.S. \ncolocation data center market has doubled in size in just four years. \nIn addition to the Exchange's rollout of Dedicated Cores, the Exchange \nis mindful of its other business areas and the need to continue to be \nmindful of its existing, external restraints in procuring additional \nspace in this area. The Exchange has, and will continue to, monitor \nmarket participant demand and space availability and endeavor to adjust \nthe limit if and when the Exchange is able to acquire additional space \nand power within the third-party data centers and/or CPU Cores to \naccommodate additional Dedicated Cores.\\26\\ The Exchange monitors its \ncapacity and data center space and thus is in the best place to \ndetermine these limits and modify them as appropriate in response to \nchanges to this capacity and space, as well as market demand. For \nexample, the Exchange's affiliate Cboe EDGA Exchange, Inc. has \nincreased the prescribed maximum limit three times since the launch of \nDedicated Cores on its exchange on February 26, 2024 as a result of \nevaluating the demand relative to Dedicated Cores availability.\\27\\ The \nproposed increased limits continue to apply uniformly to similarly \nsituated market participants (i.e., all Members are subject to the same \nlimit and all Sponsored Participants are subject to the same limit, \nrespectively). The Exchange believes it's not unfairly discriminatory \nto provide for different limits for different types of Users. For \nexample, the Exchange believes it's not unfairly discriminatory to \nprovide for an initial lower limit to be allocated for Sponsored \nParticipants because unlike Members, Sponsored Participants are able to \naccess the Exchange without paying a Membership Fee. Members also have \nmore regulatory obligations and risk that Sponsored Participants do \nnot. For example, while Sponsored Participants must agree to comply \nwith the Rules of the Exchange, it is the Sponsoring Member of that \nSponsored Participant that remains ultimately responsible for all \norders entered on or through the Exchange by that Sponsored \nParticipant. The industry also has a history of applying fees \ndifferently to Members as compared to Sponsored Participants.\\28\\ \nLastly, the Exchange\n\n[[Page 22366]]\n\nbelieves its proposed maximum limits, and distinction between Members \nand Sponsored Participants, is another appropriate means to help the \nExchange manage its allotment of Dedicated Cores and better ensure this \nfinite resource is apportioned fairly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ The Exchange notes that it cannot currently convert shared \nCPU cores into Dedicated Cores.\n    \\26\\ The Exchange has two Users that takes Dedicated Cores at or \nnear the maximum limits, and the average number of Dedicated Cores \nused for the Exchange is 22.\n    \\27\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99983 (April 17, \n2024), 89 FR 30418 (April 23, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-014); \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 100300 (June 10, 2024), 89 FR \n50653 (June 14, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-020); and Securities \nExchange Act Release No. 100736 (August 21, 2024), 89 FR 67696 \n(August 15, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-032).\n    \\28\\ See e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 68342 \n(December 3, 2012), 77 FR 73096 (December 7, 2012) (SR-CBOE-2012-\n114).and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 66082 (January 3, \n2012), 77 FR 1101 (January 9, 2012) (SR-C2-2011-041).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act because the proposed tiered fee \nstructure will apply equally to all similarly situated Users that \nchoose to use Dedicated Cores. As discussed above, Dedicated Cores are \noptional and Users may choose to utilize Dedicated Cores, or not, based \non their views of the additional benefits and added value provided by \nutilizing a Dedicated Core. The Exchange believes the proposed fees \nwill be assessed proportionately to the potential value or benefit \nreceived by Users with a greater number of Dedicated Cores and notes \nthat Users may determine at any time to cease using Dedicated Cores. As \ndiscussed, Users can also continue to access the Exchange through \nshared CPU Cores at no additional cost. Finally, all Users will be \nentitled to two Dedicated Cores at no additional cost.\n    Next, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change does not \nimpose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or \nappropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously \ndiscussed, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market, \nincluding competition for exchange memberships. Market Participants \nhave numerous alternative venues that they may participate on, \nincluding 15 other equities exchanges, as well as off-exchange venues, \nwhere competitive products are available for trading. Indeed, \nparticipants can readily choose to submit their order flow to other \nexchange and off-exchange venues if they deem fee levels at those other \nvenues to be more favorable. Further, as described above, Nasdaq also \nalready provides a similar offering.\\29\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market, Equity 7 Pricing Schedule, \nSection 115(g)(3), Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference \nfor competition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, \nproducts, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, in \nRegulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market \nforces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized \nthat current regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably \nsuccessful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that \nare most important to investors and listed companies.'' \\30\\ The fact \nthat this market is competitive has also long been recognized by the \ncourts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. \nCircuit stated as follows: ``[n]o one disputes that competition for \norder flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. \nnational market system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the \nbroker-dealers that act as their order-routing agents, have a wide \nrange of choices of where to route orders for execution' [and] `no \nexchange can afford to take its market share percentages for granted' \nbecause `no exchange possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in \nthe execution of order flow from broker dealers'. . . .''.\\31\\ \nAccordingly, the Exchange does not believe its proposed change imposes \nany burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005).\n    \\31\\ NetCoalition v.

Cir. 2010) \n(quoting Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59039 (December 2, \n2008), 73 FR 74770, 74782-83 (December 9, 2008) (SR-NYSEArca-2006-\n21)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\32\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\33\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

Institution of proceedings is appropriate at this time in \nview of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change. \nInstitution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has \nreached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. \nRather, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to \nprovide comments on the proposed rule change.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,\\14\\ the Commission is \nproviding notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. \nThe Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional \nanalysis of the proposed rule change's consistency with Section 6(b)(5) \nof the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a \nnational securities exchange be ``designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices'' and ``to protect investors and the \npublic interest.'' \\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ Id.\n    \\15\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the \nExchange's statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth \nin the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to \nsubmit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission \nseeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the \nTrust, which would hold XRP, is designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not \npreviously contemplated by the Commission.\n\nIV. Procedure: Request for Written Comments\n\n    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written \nsubmissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the \nissues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have \nwith the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written \nviews of interested persons concerning whether the proposal, as \nmodified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) or any \nother provision of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. \nAlthough there do not appear to be any issues relevant to approval or \ndisapproval that would be facilitated by an oral presentation of views, \ndata, and arguments, the Commission will consider, pursuant to Rule \n19b-4, any request for an opportunity to make an oral presentation.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the Securities \nActs Amendments of 1975, Public Law 94-29 (June 4, 1975), grants the \nCommission flexibility to determine what type of proceeding--either \noral or notice and opportunity for written comments--is appropriate \nfor consideration of a particular proposal by a self-regulatory \norganization. See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Senate Comm. \non Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st \nSess. 30 (1975).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and \narguments regarding whether the proposed rule change, as modified by\n\n[[Page 22368]]\n\nAmendment No. 1, should be approved or disapproved by June 17, 2025. \nAny person who wishes to file a rebuttal to any other person's \nsubmission must file that rebuttal by July 1, 2025.\n    Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods:\n\nElectronic Comments\n\n    <bullet> Use the Commission's internet comment form (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml\">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml</a>); or\n    <bullet> Send an email to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e795928b82ca84888a8a82899394a7948284c9808891\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"1b696e777e36787476767e756f685b687e78357c746d\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to increase the monthly fee for 10 Gb \nphysical ports. The text of the proposed rule change is provided in \nExhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/BZX/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/BZX/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the\n\n[[Page 22369]]\n\nSecretary, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule relating to \nphysical connectivity fees.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange initially filed the proposed fee changes on \nJuly 3, 2023 (SR-CboeBZX-2023-047). On September 1, 2023, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2023-068. On \nSeptember 29, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a \nSuspension of and Order Instituting Proceedings to Determine whether \nto Approve or Disapprove a Proposed Rule Change to Amend its Fees \nSchedule Related to Physical Port Fees (the ``OIP'') in anticipation \nof a possible U.S. government shutdown. On September 29, 2023, the \nExchange filed the proposed fee change (SR-CboeBZX-2023-79). On \nOctober 13, 2023, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted \nSR-CboeBZX-2023-083. On December 12, 2023 the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2023-104. On February 9, 2024, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2024-017. On \nApril 9, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted this \nSR-CboeBZX-2024-028. On April 18, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2024-030. On June 7, 2024, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2024-052. On \nAugust 29, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-\nCboeBZX-2024-080. On October 25, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2024-107. On October 28, 2024, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2024-109. On \nDecember 18, 2024 the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted \nSR-CboeBZX-2024-128. On February 14, 2025, the Exchange withdrew \nthat filing and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2025-030. On March 13, 2025, \nthe Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeBZX-2025-043. \nOn May 9, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted this \nfiling.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, a physical port is utilized by a Member or \nnon-Member to connect to the Exchange at the data centers where the \nExchange's servers are located. The Exchange currently assesses the \nfollowing physical connectivity fees for Members and non-Members on a \nmonthly basis: $2,500 per physical port for a 1 gigabit (``Gb'') \ncircuit and $7,500 per physical port for a 10 Gb circuit. The Exchange \nproposes to increase the monthly fee for 10 Gb physical ports from \n$7,500 to $8,500 per port. The Exchange notes the proposed fee change \nbetter enables it to continue to maintain and improve its market \ntechnology and services and also notes that the proposed fee amount, \neven as amended, continues to be in line with, or even lower than, \namounts assessed by other exchanges for similar connections.\\4\\ The \nExchange also notes that a single 10 Gb physical port can be used to \naccess the Systems of the following affiliate exchanges: the Cboe BYX \nExchange, Inc., Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (options and equities \nplatforms), Cboe EDGA Exchange, Inc., and Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc., \n(``Affiliate Exchanges'').\\5\\ Notably, only one monthly fee currently \n(and will continue) to apply per 10 Gb physical port regardless of how \nmany affiliated exchanges are accessed through that one port.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See e.g., The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), General \n8, Connectivity to the Exchange. Nasdaq and its affiliated exchanges \ncharge a monthly fee of $16,500 for each 10 Gb Ultra fiber \nconnection to the respective exchange. See also New York Stock \nExchange LLC, NYSE American LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc., NYSE Chicago Inc., \nNYSE National, Inc. Connectivity Fee Schedule, which provides that \n10 Gb LX LCN Circuits (which are analogous to the Exchange's 10 Gb \nphysical port) are assessed $22,000 per month, per port.\n    \\5\\ The Affiliate Exchanges are also submitting contemporaneous \nidentical rule filings.\n    \\6\\ The Exchange notes that conversely, other exchange groups \ncharge separate port fees for access to separate, but affiliated, \nexchanges. See e.g., Securities and Exchange Release No. 99822 \n(March 21, 2024), 89 FR 21337 (March 27, 2024) (SR-MIAX-2024-016).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\7\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\8\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\9\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) \\10\\ of the Act, which \nrequires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of \nreasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other \npersons using its facilities. This belief is based on various factors \nas described below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\8\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\9\\ Id.\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    First, the Exchange believes its proposal is reasonable as it \nreflects a moderate increase in physical connectivity fees for 10 Gb \nphysical ports and its offering, even as amended, continues to be more \naffordable as compared to analogous physical connectivity offerings at \ncompetitor exchanges. For example, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC \n(``Nasdaq'') and its affiliated exchanges charge a monthly fee of \n$16,500 for each 10Gbps Ultra fiber connection and $11,000 per month \nfor each 10 Gbps fiber connection to their respective exchange.\\11\\ The \nExchange's proposed fee of $8,500 per physical port is lower than both \nof these offerings.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), General 8, \nConnectivity to the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Yet another example of higher fees charged by a competitor exchange \nis the 10Gpbs LX LCN Circuits offered by the New York Stock Exchange \nLLC and its affiliates (collectively, ``NYSE''). NYSE charges a fee of \n$22,000 per month,\\12\\ per port in contrast to the Exchange's proposed \nmonthly fee of $8,500 per month, per port. Despite the Exchange \nproposing to increase its fee for its 10 Gb physical port, it still \ncomes in at a cost significantly lower than its competitors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See New York Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE American LLC, NYSE \nArca, Inc., NYSE Chicago Inc., NYSE National, Inc. Connectivity Fee \nSchedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Lastly, the Exchange also points towards the equivalent offering \nfrom MIAX Saphire and its affiliated options exchanges, MIAX Options, \nMIAX Pearl and MIAX Emerald (collectively, ``MIAX Exchanges'') which is \n$13,500 per port per month. \\13\\ The Exchange reiterates that a single \nphysical port offering from the Exchange offers the ability to connect \nto the Affiliated Exchanges (equities and options) and the monthly \nprice does not change based on the number of exchanges a\n\n[[Page 22370]]\n\nparticipant is connected to. In this case, examining only the Exchange \nand its Affiliated Options Exchanges, (even though the same physical \nport could also connect to the Exchange's affiliated equities \nexchanges) a participant could purchase a single physical port from the \nExchange and access roughly 14% of the U.S. Options Market for a cost \nof $8,500. In contrast, if a participant desired to access all MIAX \nExchanges, allowing access to roughly 16% of the U.S. Options Market, \nit would cost that participant $54,000 ($13,500 per port per month x 4 \nMIAX Exchanges).\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See e.g., MIAX Options Fee Schedule.\n    \\14\\ See Cboe U.S. Options Market Volume Summary (May 8, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes the current fee does not properly \nreflect the quality of the service and product, as fees for 10 Gb \nphysical ports have been static in nominal terms since 2018, and \ntherefore falling in real terms due to inflation. As a general matter, \nthe Producer Price Index (``PPI'') is a family of indexes that measures \nthe average change over time in selling prices received by domestic \nproducers of goods and services. PPI measures price change from the \nperspective of the seller. This contrasts with other metrics, such as \nthe Consumer Price Index (CPI), that measure price change from the \npurchaser's perspective.\\15\\ About 10,000 PPIs for individual products \nand groups of products are tracked and released each month.\\16\\ PPIs \nare available for the output of nearly all industries in the goods-\nproducing sectors of the U.S. economy--mining, manufacturing, \nagriculture, fishing, and forestry--as well as natural gas, \nelectricity, and construction, among others. The PPI program covers \napproximately 69 percent of the service sector's output, as measured by \nrevenue reported in the 2017 Economic Census.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>.\n    \\16\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For purposes of this proposal, the relevant industry-specific PPI \nis the Data Processing, hosting and related services (``Data PPI'') and \nmore particularly the more granular service line Data Processing, \nHosting and Related Services: Hosting, Active Server Pages (ASP), and \nOther Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure Provisioning \nServices.\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Provisioning is the process of preparing, assigning, and \nactivating IT infrastructure components, such as servers, storage, \nand network connectivity, according to user requirements. It is a \ncritical part of IT operations, as it ensures that computing \nresources are available when needed and that they are set up and \nconnected to work correctly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Data PPI was introduced in January 2002 by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics (``BLS'') as part of an ongoing effort to expand Producer \nPrice Index coverage of the services sector of the U.S. economy and is \nidentified as NAICS-518210 in the North American Industry \nClassification System (``NAICS'').\\18\\ According to the BLS ``[t]he \nprimary output of NAICS 518210 is the provision of electronic data \nprocessing services. In the broadest sense, computer services companies \nhelp their customers efficiently use technology. The processing \nservices market consists of vendors who use their own computer \nsystems--often utilizing proprietary software--to process customers' \ntransactions and data. Price movements for the NAICS 518210 index are \nbased on changes in the revenue received by companies that provide data \nprocessing services and price movements for the service line NAICS \n518210 index are based on changes in the revenue received by companies \nthat provide, among other things, IT infrastructure provisioning \nservices. Each month, companies provide net transaction prices for a \nspecified service. The transaction is an actual contract selected by \nprobability, where the price-determining characteristics are held \nconstant while the service is repriced. The prices used in index \ncalculation are the actual prices billed for the selected service \ncontract.'' \\19\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>. Among the \nindustry-specific PPIs is for North American Industry Classification \nSystem (``NAICS'') Code 518210: ``Data Processing and Related \nServices,'' NAICS index codes categorize products and services that \nare common to particular industries. According to BLS, these codes \n``provide comparability with a wide assortment of industry-based \ndata for other economic programs, including productivity, \nproduction, employment, wages, and earnings.''\n    \\19\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-services-industry-naics-518210.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-services-industry-naics-518210.htm</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The service (product) lines for which price indexes are available \nunder the Data PPI are: (1) business process management services (2) \ndata management and storage information transformation and other \nservices and (3) hosting ASP and other IT infrastructure provisioning \nservices. The most apt of these industry and product specific \ncategorizations for purposes of this present proposal to modify fees \nfor the 10 Gb physical port fee measures inflation for the provision of \ndata processing, hosting and related services as well as other \ninformation technology infrastructure provisioning services which BLS \nidentifies as identified as NAICS-5182105.\\20\\ The Exchange believes \nthat this measure of inflation is particularly appropriate because the \nExchange's connectivity services involve hosting and providing \nconnections to its customers' telecommunications and information \ntechnology equipment, as well as preparing, assigning, and activating \nIT infrastructure components, such as servers, storage, and network \nconnectivity. The Exchange also uses its ``proprietary software,'' \ni.e., its own proprietary matching engine software, to receive orders \non the Exchange's proprietary trading platform as well as to collect, \norganize, store and report customers' transactions. In other words, the \nExchange is in the business of data processing, hosting, ASP, and \nproviding other IT infrastructure provisioning services. Specifically, \nwithin this category, the Exchange points to the financial business \nprocess management services category under the umbrella of data \nprocessing.\\21\\ The financial business process management services is \ndescribed as ``providing a bundled service package that combines \ninformation-technology-intensive services with labor (manual or \nprofessional depending on the solution), machinery, and facilities to \nsupport, host and manage a financial business process for a client, \nsuch as financial transaction processing, credit card processing, \npayment services, and lending services.'' \\22\\ The Exchange's \nconnectivity service provides connections to its customers' \ntelecommunications and information technology equipment, as well as \npreparing, assigning, and activating IT infrastructure components to \nfacilitate the transmission of orders and receipt of financial \ntransactions for its customers' while connected to the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ See <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105\">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105</a>.\n    \\21\\ See <a href=\"https://voorburggroup.org/Documents/2018%20Rome/Papers/1014.pdf\">https://voorburggroup.org/Documents/2018%20Rome/Papers/1014.pdf</a>.\n    \\22\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, the Exchange believes that this specific index is best \nsuited to guide this price increase as it reflects the change in this \nspecific instance over the last seven years instead of looking at the \nunderlying components of the service. PPI has published broad guidance \nregarding price adjustments for contracts,\\23\\ and within this it noted \nthat contracting parties should choose an index or group of indexes \nthat represent the cost for providing a particular product or service, \nrather than an index for the product itself.\\24\\\n\n[[Page 22371]]\n\nWhile this helps a contracting seller avoid a circumstance where it is \nunable to raise its price for the product itself if the underlying \ncomponents have increased and the PPI for the product itself has not \nyet increased- this is not the case here. The Exchange instead is using \nhistorical data over a seven-year period as a reference point for its \nproposed increase moving forward- underlying components that have \nincreased over the course of seven years have since (by and large) been \nreflected in the product itself.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting-parties.htm#FOOT5\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting-parties.htm#FOOT5</a>.\n    \\24\\ ``For example, if an apparel manufacturer were contracting \nfor long-term purchases with a producer of finished fabrics, it \nwould be more advisable to tie the price adjustment clause to a PPI \nfor synthetic fibers, processed yarns and threads, or greige fabrics \n(raw fabric), rather than to a PPI for a type of finished fabric.'' \nId.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange further believes the Data PPI is an appropriate \nmeasure for purposes of the proposed rule change on the basis that it \nis a stable metric with limited volatility, unlike other consumer-side \ninflation metrics. In fact, the Data PPI has not experienced a greater \nthan 2.16% increase for any one calendar year period since Data PPI was \nintroduced into the PPI in January 2002. For example, the average \ncalendar year change from January 2002 to December 2023 was .62%, with \na cumulative increase of 15.67% over this 21-year period. The Exchange \nbelieves the Data PPI is considerably less volatile than other \ninflation metrics such as CPI, which has had individual calendar-year \nincreases of more than 6.5%, and a cumulative increase of over 73% over \nthe same period.\\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ See <a href=\"https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/\">https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As noted above, the current 10 Gb physical port fee remained \nunchanged for almost seven years, particularly since June 2018.\\26\\ \nSince its last increase almost 7 years ago however, there has been \nnotable inflation, including under the industry- and product-specific \nPPI, which as described above is a tailored measure of inflation. \nParticularly, the Hosting, ASP and other IT Infrastructure Provisioning \nServices inflation measure had a starting value of 102.2 in June 2018 \n(the month the Exchange started assessing the current fee) and an \nending value of 118.502 in January 2025, representing a 16% \nincrease.\\27\\ This indicates that companies who are also in the hosting \nASP and other IT infrastructure provisioning services have generally \nincreased prices for a specified service covered under NAICS 5182105 by \nan average of 16% during this period.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\26\\ See Securities and Exchange Release No. 83429 (June 14, \n2018), 83 FR 28685 (June 20, 2018) (SR-CboeBZX-2018-038).\n    \\27\\ See <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105\">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes that it is reasonable to increase its \nfees to compensate for inflation because, over time, inflation has \ndegraded the value of each dollar that the Exchange collects in fees, \nsuch that the real revenue collected today is considerably less than \nthat same revenue collected in 2018. The impact of this inflationary \neffect is also independent of any change in the Exchange's costs in \nproviding its goods and services. The Exchange therefore believes that \nit is reasonable for it to offset, in part, this erosion in the value \nof the revenues it collects. Additionally, the Exchange historically \ndoes not increase fees every year notwithstanding inflation.\\28\\ Other \nexchanges have also filed for increases in certain fees, based in part \non comparisons to inflation.\\29\\ Accordingly, based on the above-\ndescribed percentage change based on an industry- and product-specific \ninflationary measure, and in conjunction with the rationale further \ndescribed above and below, the Exchange believes the proposed fee \nincrease is reasonable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ As the Exchange historically does not increase fees every \nyear notwithstanding inflation, the Exchange believes that the more \nspecific index is appropriate to look at as it is reflective of the \ncumulative increase over the course of almost seven years. While the \nPPI has published guidance that a broader index may be more helpful \nto reference in a contract to avoid large swings on a shorter \nduration (and to which such a swing over a brief duration may \ntrigger additional obligations), the Exchange, in contrast, is \ninstead looking forward to adjust its price to reflect changes in \nthe industry over the past seven years. See supra note 20.\n    \\29\\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-100994 \n(September 10, 2024), 89 FR 75612 (September 16, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-\n2024-79).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Next, the Exchange believes significant investments into, and \nenhanced performance of, the Exchange, in the years following the last \n10 Gb physical port fee increase support the reasonableness of the \nproposed fee increase. These investments enhanced the quality of its \nservices, as measured by, among other things, increased throughput and \nfaster processing speeds. Customers have therefore greatly benefitted \nfrom these investments, while the Exchange's ability to recoup its \ninvestments has been hampered.\n    For example, the Exchange and its affiliated exchanges recently \nlaunched a multi-year initiative to improve Cboe Exchange Platform \nperformance and capacity requirements to increase competitiveness, \nsupport growth and advance a consistent world class platform. The goal \nof the project, among other things, is to provide faster and more \nconsistent order handling and matching performance for options, while \nensuring quicker processing time and supporting increasing volumes and \ncapacity needs. For example, the Exchange recently performed switch \nhardware upgrades. Particularly, the Exchange replaced existing \ncustomer access switches with newer models, which the Exchange believes \nresulted in increased determinism. The recent switch upgrades also \nincreased the Exchange's capacity to accommodate more physical ports by \nnearly 50%. Network bandwidth was also increased nearly two-fold as a \nresult of the upgrades, which among other things, can lead to reduce \nmessage queuing. The Exchange also believes these newer models result \nin less natural variance in the processing of messages. The Exchange \nnotes that it incurred costs associated with purchasing and upgrading \nto these newer models, of which the Exchange has not otherwise passed \nthrough or offset.\n    As of April 1, 2024, market participants also having the option of \nconnecting to a new data center (i.e., Secaucus NY6 Data Center \n(``NY6'')), in addition to the current data centers at NY4 and NY5. The \nExchange made NY6 available in response to customer requests in \nconnection with their need for additional space and capacity. In order \nto make this space available, the Exchange expended significant \nresources to prepare this space, and will also incur ongoing costs with \nrespect to maintaining this offering, including costs related to power, \nspace, fiber, cabinets, panels, labor and maintenance of racks. The \nExchange also incurred a large cost with respect to ensuring NY6 would \nbe latency equalized, as it is for NY4 and NY5.\n    The Exchange also has made various other improvements since the \ncurrent physical port rates were adopted in 2018. For example, the \nExchange has updated its customer portal to provide more transparency \nwith respect to firms' respective connectivity subscriptions, enabling \nthem to better monitor, evaluate and adjust their connections based on \ntheir evolving business needs. The Exchange also performs proactive \naudits on a weekly basis to ensure that all customer cross connects \ncontinue to fall within allowable tolerances for Latency Equalized \nconnections. Accordingly, the Exchange expended, and will continue to \nexpend, resources to innovate and modernize technology so that it may \nbenefit its Members and continue to compete among other options \nmarkets. The ability to continue to innovate with technology and offer \nnew products to market participants allows the Exchange to remain \ncompetitive in the options space which currently has 18 registered \noptions\n\n[[Page 22372]]\n\nmarkets and potential new entrants. If the Exchange were not able to \nassess incrementally higher fees for its connectivity, it would \neffectively impact how the Exchange manages its technology and hamper \nthe Exchange's ability to continue to invest in and fund access \nservices in a manner that allows it to meet existing and anticipated \naccess demands of market participants. Disapproval of fee changes such \nas the proposal herein, could also have the adverse effect of \ndiscouraging an exchange from improving its operations and implementing \ninnovative technology to the benefit of market participants if it \nbelieves the Commission would later prevent that exchange from \nrecouping costs and monetizing its operational enhancements, thus \nadversely impacting competition as well as the interests of market \nparticipants and investors.\n    Finally, the proposed fee is also the same as is concurrently being \nproposed for its Affiliate Exchanges. Further, Members are able to \nutilize a single port to connect to all of its Affiliate Exchanges and \nwill only be charged one single fee (i.e., a market participant will \nonly be assessed the proposed $8,500 even if it uses that physical port \nto connect to the Exchange and another (or even all 6) of its Affiliate \nExchanges. Particularly, the Exchange believes the proposed monthly per \nport fee is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly discriminatory since \nas the Exchange has determined to not charge multiple fees for the same \nport. Indeed, the Exchange notes that several ports are in fact \npurchased and utilized across one or more of the Exchange's affiliated \nExchanges (and charged only once).\n    The Exchange also believes that the proposed fee change is not \nunfairly discriminatory because it would be assessed uniformly across \nall market participants that purchase the physical ports. The Exchange \nbelieves increasing the fee for 10 Gb physical ports and charging a \nhigher fee as compared to the 1 Gb physical port is equitable as the 1 \nGb physical port is \\1/10\\th the size of the 10 Gb physical port and \ntherefore does not offer access to many of the products and services \noffered by the Exchange (e.g., ability to receive certain market data \nproducts). Thus, the value of the 1 Gb alternative is lower than the \nvalue of the 10 Gb alternative, when measured based on the type of \nExchange access it offers. Moreover, market participants that purchase \n10 Gb physical ports utilize the most bandwidth and therefore consume \nthe most resources from the network. The Exchange also anticipates that \nfirms that utilize 10 Gb ports will benefit the most from the \nExchange's investment in offering NY6 as the Exchange anticipates there \nwill be much higher quantities of 10 Gb physical ports connecting from \nNY6 as compared to 1 Gb ports. Indeed, the Exchange notes that 10 Gb \nphysical ports account for approximately 90% of physical ports across \nthe NY4, NY5, and NY6 data centers, and to date, 80% of new port \nconnections in NY6 are 10 Gb ports. As such, the Exchange believes the \nproposed fee change for 10 Gb physical ports is reasonably and \nappropriately allocated.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed fee change will \nnot impact intramarket competition because it will apply to all \nsimilarly situated Members equally (i.e., all market participants that \nchoose to purchase the 10 Gb physical port). Additionally, the Exchange \ndoes not believe its proposed pricing will impose a barrier to entry to \nsmaller participants and notes that its proposed connectivity pricing \nis associated with relative usage of the various market participants. \nFor example, market participants with modest capacity needs can \ncontinue to buy the less expensive 1 Gb physical port (which cost is \nnot changing) or may choose to obtain access via a third-party re-\nseller. While pricing may be increased for the larger capacity physical \nports, such options provide far more capacity and are purchased by \nthose that consume more resources from the network. Accordingly, the \nproposed connectivity fees do not favor certain categories of market \nparticipants in a manner that would impose a burden on competition; \nrather, the allocation reflects the network resources consumed by the \nvarious size of market participants--lowest bandwidth consuming members \npay the least, and highest bandwidth consuming members pays the most.\n    The proposed fee change also does not impose a burden on \ncompetition or on other Self-Regulatory Organizations that is not \nnecessary or appropriate. As described above, the Exchange evaluated \nits proposed fee change using objective and stable metric with limited \nvolatility. Utilizing Data Processing PPI over a specified period of \ntime is a reasonable means of recouping a portion of the Exchange's \ninvestment in maintaining and enhancing the connectivity service \nidentified above. The Exchange believes utilizing Data Processing PPI, \na tailored measure of inflation, to increase certain connectivity fees \nto recoup the Exchange's investment in maintaining and enhancing its \nservices and products would not impose a burden on competition.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\30\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\31\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to adopt Rule 5703 to permit the generic \nlisting and trading of Multi-Class Exchange-Traded Fund (``ETF'') \nShares that comply with the requirements of Rule 6c-11 under the \nInvestment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Investment Company Act'') and are \neligible to operate in reliance on exemptive relief from certain \nrequirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and \nregulations thereunder that permit the trust issuing the Multi-Class \nETF Shares to offer an exchange-traded fund class in addition to \nclasses of shares that are not exchange-traded. The Exchange is also \nproposing to make conforming changes to Rule 5615 (Exemptions from \nCertain Corporate Governance Requirements), Rule 5705(b) (Index Fund \nShares), Rule 5735 (Managed Fund Shares), and Equity 4, Rule 4120 in \norder to accommodate the proposed listing of Multi-Class ETF Shares.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's \nwebsite at <a href=\"https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rulefilings\">https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rulefilings</a>, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the \nCommission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to adopt new Rule 5703 for the purpose of \npermitting the generic listing and trading, or trading pursuant to \nunlisted trading privileges, of Multi-Class Exchange-Traded Fund \n(``ETF'') Shares that comply with the requirements of Rule 6c-11 under \nthe Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Investment Company Act''), \nand are eligible to operate in reliance on exemptive relief from \ncertain requirements of the Investment Company Act and the rules and \nregulations thereunder that permit the trust issuing the Multi-Class \nETF Shares to offer an exchange-traded fund class in addition to \nclasses of shares that are not exchange-traded of an open-end fund.\\3\\ \nThe Exchange is also proposing to make conforming changes to Rule 5615 \n(Exemptions from Certain Corporate Governance Requirements), Rule \n5705(b) (Index Fund Shares), Rule 5735 (Managed Fund Shares), and \nEquity 4, Rule 4120 in order to accommodate the proposed listing of \nMulti-Class ETF Shares.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange notes that Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (``BZX'') \nhas filed a substantially similar filing. See Securities Exchange \nAct Release No. 102594 (March 11, 2025), 90 FR 12387 (March 17, \n2025) (SR-CboeBZX-2024-112).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Consistent with Exchange Traded Fund Shares, Index Fund Shares, and \nManaged Fund Shares listed under the generic listing standards in Rules \n5704, 5705(b), and 5735, respectively, series of Multi-Class ETF Shares \nthat comply with the requirements of Rule 6c-11 under the Investment \nCompany Act, and are eligible to operate in reliance on exemptive \nrelief from certain requirements of the Investment Company Act and the \nrules and regulations thereunder that permit the trust issuing the \nMulti-Class ETF Shares to offer an exchange-traded fund class in \naddition to classes of shares that are not exchange-traded of an open-\nend fund would be permitted to be listed and traded on the Exchange \nwithout prior Commission approval order or notice of effectiveness \npursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ Rule 19b-4(e)(1) provides that the listing and trading of a \nnew derivative securities product by a self-regulatory organization \n(``SRO'') is not deemed a proposed rule change, pursuant to \nparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 19b-4, if the Commission has approved, \npursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act, the SRO's trading rules, \nprocedures and listing standards for the product class that would \ninclude the new derivative securities product and the SRO has a \nsurveillance program for the product class. As contemplated by this \nRule 5703, the Exchange proposes new Rule 5703 to establish generic \nlisting standards for Multi-Class ETFs that are permitted to operate \nin reliance on exemptive relief to Rule 6c-11 under the Investment \nCompany Act that permits the trust issuing the Multi-Class ETF \nShares to offer an exchange-traded fund class in addition to classes \nof shares that are not exchange-traded of an open-end fund. A Multi-\nClass ETF listed under proposed Rule 5703 would therefore not need a \nseparate proposed rule change pursuant to Rule 19b-4 before it can \nbe listed and traded on the Exchange.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22374]]\n\nBackground\n    There are numerous applications for exemptive relief for Multi-\nClass ETF Shares currently before the Commission \\5\\ that request \nexemptive relief similar to that previously granted to other funds.\\6\\ \nThis proposal would provide for the ``generic'' listing and/or trading \nof Multi-Class ETF Shares under proposed Rule 5703 on the Exchange \nimmediately upon the Commission's applicable order granting exemptive \nrelief to the outstanding applications. The Exchange submits this \nproposal only to prevent any unnecessary delay in listing additional \nMulti-Class ETF Shares generically under Rule 5703 when and if such \nrequests are granted by the Commission.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See e.g., DFA Investment Dimensions Group Inc. and \nDimensional Investment Group Inc., (amendment filed March 31, 2025); \nF/m Investments LLC (amendment filed April 10, 2025); Fidelity \nHastings Street Trust and Fidelity Management & Research Company \n(amendment filed April 11, 2025); Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund \nTrust and Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc. (amendment filed \nApril 11, 2025); BlackRock Funds (amendment filed April 15, 2025); \nGuinness Atkinson Funds (amendment filed April 17, 2025); \nMetropolitan West Funds, TCW ETF Trust, and TCW Funds, Inc. \n(amendment filed April 22, 2025); and Northern Funds and Northern \nTrust Investments, Inc. (amendment filed May 2, 2025).\n    \\6\\ See infra note 7.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Starting in 2000, the Commission began granting limited relief for \nThe Vanguard Group, Inc. (``Vanguard'') to offer certain index-based \nopen-end management investment companies with Multi-class ETF \nShares.\\7\\ After this relief was granted, there was limited public \ndiscourse about Multi-class ETF Shares until 2019, when the prospect of \nproviding blanket exemptive relief to Multi-class ETF Shares was \naddressed in the Commission's adoption of Rule 6c-11 under the \nInvestment Company Act (the ``ETF Rule'').\\8\\ The ETF Rule permits ETFs \nthat satisfy certain conditions to operate without the expense or delay \nof obtaining an exemptive order. However, the ETF Rule did not provide \nblanket exemptive relief to allow for Multi-class ETF Shares as part of \nthe final rule. Instead, the Commission concluded that Multi-class ETF \nShares should request relief through the exemptive application process \nso that the Commission may assess all relevant policy considerations in \nthe context of the facts and circumstances of particular applicants. \nThe Exchange adopted Rule 5704 shortly after the implementation of the \nETF Rule and, because there were no exemptive applications before the \nCommission, did not propose to include any language comparable to what \nis being proposed herein.\\9\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See Vanguard Index Funds, Investment Company Act Release \nNos. 24680 (Oct. 6, 2000) (notice) and 24789 (Dec. 12, 2000) \n(order). The Commission itself, as opposed to the Commission staff \nacting under delegated authority, considered the original Vanguard \napplication and determined that the relief was appropriate in the \npublic interest and consistent with the protection of investors and \nthe purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the \nAct. In the process of granting the order, the Commission also \nconsidered and denied a hearing request on the original application, \nas reflected in the final Commission order. See also the Vanguard \nGroup, Inc., Investment Company Act Release Nos. 26282 (Dec. 2, \n2003) (notice) and 26317 (Dec. 30, 2003) (order); Vanguard \nInternational Equity Index Funds, Investment Company Act Release \nNos. 26246 (Nov. 3, 2003) (notice) and 26281 (Dec. 1, 2003) (order); \nVanguard Bond Index Funds, Investment Company Act Release Nos. 27750 \n(Mar. 9, 2007) (notice) and 27773 (April 2, 2007) (order) \n(collectively referred to as the ``Vanguard Orders'').\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33-10695 (October \n24, 2019), 84 FR 57162 (the ``ETF Rule Adopting Release'').\n    \\9\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 88561 (April 3, \n2020), 85 FR 19984 (April 9, 2020) (SR-NASDAQ-2019-090).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As noted above, a number of applications for exemptive relief to \npermit the applicable fund to offer Multi-class ETF Shares (the \n``Applications'') have been submitted to the Commission starting in \nearly 2023. In general, the Applications state that the ability of a \nfund to offer Multi-class ETF Shares, i.e., both a class of mutual fund \nshares (each such class, a ``Mutual Fund class'' and such shares \n``Mutual Fund Shares'') and ETF Shares, could be beneficial to the fund \nand to shareholders of each type of class for various reasons, \nincluding more efficient portfolio management, better secondary market \ntrading opportunities, and cost efficiencies, among others.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ Specifically, the Applicants believe that a Mutual Fund \nclass would benefit ETF class shareholders because investor cash \nflows through a Mutual Fund class can be used for efficient \nportfolio rebalancing. To the extent that cash flows come into a \nfund through a Mutual Fund class, a portfolio manager may be able to \ndeploy that cash strategically to rebalance the portfolio. Second, \ncash flows through a Mutual Fund class may allow for greater \ncreation basket flexibility for creations and redemptions through \nthe ETF class, which could promote arbitrage efficiency and smaller \nspreads on the trading of ETF Shares in the secondary market. With \nrespect to existing funds, ETF classes would permit investors that \nprefer the ETF structure to gain access to established funds' \ninvestment strategies. Additionally, the establishment of an ETF \nclass as part of an existing fund could lead to cost efficiencies. \nSpecifically, in terms of fund expenses, an ETF class could have \ninitial and ongoing advantages for its shareholders, where \nshareholders of an ETF class of a fund that already has substantial \nassets could immediately benefit from economies of scale. Finally, \nthe tax-free conversion of shares from the Mutual Fund class to the \nETF class may accelerate the development of an ETF shareholder base. \nSubsequent secondary market transactions by the ETF class \nshareholders could generate greater trading volume, resulting in \nlower trading spreads and/or premiums or discounts in the market \nprices of the ETF Shares to the benefit of ETF shareholders. The \nApplicants also believe that an ETF class would benefit Mutual Fund \nclass shareholders because in-kind transactions through the ETF \nclass may contribute to lower portfolio transaction costs and \ngreater tax efficiency. Additionally, the conversion feature could \nallow Mutual Fund shareholders to convert Mutual Fund Shares for ETF \nShares without adverse consequences to the Fund by allowing Mutual \nFund shareholders to convert their shares into the ETF class of the \nsame fund rather than redeeming their Mutual Fund Shares and buying \nshares of another ETF. In doing so, the converting shareholder could \nsave on transaction costs and potential tax consequences that may \notherwise be incurred in redeeming their existing shares and buying \nseparate ETF Shares. The ETF class would also represent an \nadditional distribution channel for a fund that could lead to \nadditional asset grown and economies of scale; greater assets under \nmanagement may lead to additional cost efficiencies and an improved \ntax profile for the fund may also assist the competitive position of \nthe Fund for attracting prospective shareholders. Last, the class of \nETF Shares could allow certain investors to engage in more frequent \ntrading without disrupting the fund's portfolio.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    While Multi-class ETF Shares could potentially be listed under \nexisting Exchange Rules 5705(b) or 5735, doing so would unnecessarily \nre-introduce the burdensome quantitative portfolio requirements and \nongoing compliance obligations associated therewith that existed before \nthe adoption of Rule 6c-11 and Exchange Rule 5704.\\11\\ The Exchange is \nnot aware of any clear policy rationale as to why those quantitative \nrequirements should apply to Multi-class ETF Shares other than the \nrules are already in place. As such, listing Multi-class ETF Shares \nunder these older rules would place undue burdens on both the Exchange \nand fund issuers because of the quantitative portfolio requirements \nthat currently do not apply to ETFs meeting the requirements of Rule \n6c-11 and Rule 5704. Furthermore, while the Applicants generally seek \nthe same exemptive relief as granted under those previous orders,\\12\\ \nseveral Applicants have proposed different conditions to the relief \nthat reflect the adoption of Rule 6c-11. Therefore, the Exchange \nbelieves there is a reasonable relationship between the Applications \nand the proposed rule change to allow for the Commission's evaluation \nof whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act. The \nExchange also acknowledges that approval of this proposed rule change \nwould not necessarily result in the listing and trading of the \nadditional Multi-class ETF Shares under the proposed Rule until and \nunless the necessary relief was granted by the Division of Investment \nManagement, but approving this proposal would address any potential \nconcerns the Commission's Division of Trading and Markets might have as \nit\n\n[[Page 22375]]\n\nspecifically relates to the listing and trading of Multi-class ETF \nShares under proposed Rule 5704 and would allow for a smooth launch \nprocess if and when such relief is granted.\\13\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See e.g., Exchange Rules 5705(b) and 5735.\n    \\12\\ See supra note 6.\n    \\13\\ The Commission has in some instances historically approved \nExchange listing rules even when no products would necessarily be \npermitted to list under those rules. Recently, the Commission \napproved Exchange proposals to list and trade shares of ether-based \nexchange-traded products (``ETPs'') prior to any such products \nhaving an effective registration statement. As those ether-based \nETPs could not trade on the Exchange without an effective \nregistration statement, which were separately considered by the \nCommission's division of corporate finance, the Exchange could not \nlist and trade those products even with proper Exchange Rules in \nplace. The Exchange believes this example illustrates the \nreasonability of the Exchange pursuing the adoption a proposed Rule \nthat would not immediately result in the listing and trading of the \napplicable products thereunder. See Securities Exchange Act No. \n100224 (May 23, 2024) 89 FR 46937 (May 30, 2024) (Order Granting \nAccelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes, as Modified by \nAmendments Thereto, To List and Trade Shares of Ether-Based \nExchange-Traded Products).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposal\n    Proposed Rule 5703(a) provides that the Exchange will consider for \ntrading, whether by listing or pursuant to unlisted trading privileges, \nthe shares of Multi-Class ETF Shares that meet the criteria of this \nRule.\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ To the extent that a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares does \nnot satisfy one or more of the criteria in proposed Rule 5703, the \nExchange may file a separate proposal under Section 19(b) of the Act \nin order to list such series on the Exchange. Any of the statements \nor representations in that proposal regarding the index composition, \nthe description of the portfolio or reference assets, limitations on \nportfolio holdings or reference assets, dissemination and \navailability of index, reference asset, and intraday indicative \nvalues (as applicable), or the applicability of Exchange listing \nrules specified in any filing to list such series of Multi-Class ETF \nShares shall constitute continued listing requirements for the \nseries of Multi-Class ETF Shares. Further, in the event that a \nseries of Multi-Class ETF Shares becomes listed under proposed Rule \n5703 and subsequently can no longer rely on the applicable exemptive \nrelief to Rule 6c-11, such series of Multi-Class ETF Shares may be \nlisted as a series of Index Fund Shares under Rule 5705(b) or \nManaged Fund Shares under Rule 5735, as applicable, as long as the \nseries of Multi-Class ETF Shares meets all listing requirements \napplicable under the applicable rule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Proposed Rule 5703(b) provides that the proposed rule would be \napplicable only to Multi-Class ETF Shares. Except to the extent \ninconsistent with this Rule, or unless the context otherwise requires, \nthe rules and procedures of the Board of Directors shall be applicable \nto the trading on the Exchange of such securities. Multi-Class ETF \nShares are included within the definition of ``security'' or \n``securities'' as such terms are used in the Rules of the Exchange.\n    Proposed Rule 5703(b) further provides that: (1) transactions in \nMulti-Class ETF Shares will occur throughout the Exchange's trading \nhours; and (2) the Exchange will implement and maintain written \nsurveillance procedures for Multi-Class ETF Shares.\n    Proposed Rule 5703(c) will set forth the definitions used in the \nRule. Specifically, proposed Rule 5703(c)(1) provides that the term \n``Multi-Class ETF Shares'' means shares of stock issued by a Multi-\nClass ETF.\n    Proposed Rule 5703(c)(2) provides that the term ``Multi-Class ETF'' \nmeans a fund that is subject to the same relief and constraints as \nexchange-traded funds under Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company \nexcept that the security is issued by a trust that issues Multi-Class \nETF Shares in addition to classes of shares of an open-end fund that \nare not exchange-traded.\n    Proposed Rule 5703(c)(3) provides that the term ``Reporting \nAuthority'' in respect of a particular series of Multi-Class ETF Shares \nmeans the Exchange, an institution, or a reporting service designated \nby the Exchange or by the exchange that lists a particular series of \nMulti-Class ETF Shares (if the Exchange is trading such series pursuant \nto unlisted trading privileges) as the official source for calculating \nand reporting information relating to such series, including, but not \nlimited to, the amount of any dividend equivalent payment or cash \ndistribution to holders of Multi-Class ETF Shares, net asset value, \nindex or portfolio value, the current value of the portfolio of \nsecurities required in connection with issuance of Multi-Class ETF \nShares, or other information relating to the issuance, redemption or \ntrading of Multi-Class ETF Shares. A series of Multi-Class ETF Shares \nmay have more than one Reporting Authority, each having different \nfunctions.\n    Proposed Rule 5703(d) provides that the Exchange may approve a \nseries of Multi-Class ETF Shares for listing and/or trading (including \npursuant to unlisted trading privileges) on the Exchange pursuant to \nRule 19b-4(e) under the Act, provided such series of Multi-Class ETF \nShares complies with the requirements of Rule 6c-11 under the \nInvestment Company Act, and is eligible to operate in reliance on \nexemptive relief from certain requirements of the Investment Company \nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder that permits the fund to \noffer Multi-Class ETF Shares, and must satisfy the requirements of this \nRule on an initial and continued listing basis.\n    Proposed Rule 5703(d)(1) provides that the requirements of \nparagraph (d) of this Rule must be satisfied by a series of Multi-Class \nETF Shares on an initial and continued listing basis. Such securities \nmust also satisfy the following criteria on an initial and, except for \nsub-paragraph (A) below, continued, listing basis. Further, proposed \nRule 5703(d)(1) provides that: (A) for each series, the Exchange will \nestablish a minimum number of Multi-Class ETF Shares required to be \noutstanding at the time of commencement of trading on the Exchange; (B) \nif an index underlying a series of Multi- Class ETF Shares is \nmaintained by a broker-dealer or fund adviser, the broker-dealer or \nfund adviser shall erect and maintain a ``fire wall'' around the \npersonnel who have access to information concerning changes and \nadjustments to the index and the index shall be calculated by a third \nparty who is not a broker-dealer or fund adviser. If the investment \nadviser to the investment company issuing an actively managed series of \nMulti-Class ETF Shares is affiliated with a broker-dealer, such \ninvestment adviser shall erect and maintain a ``fire wall'' between the \ninvestment adviser and the broker-dealer with respect to access to \ninformation concerning the composition and/or changes to such Multi-\nClass ETF's portfolio; and (C) any advisory committee, supervisory \nboard, or similar entity that advises a Reporting Authority or that \nmakes decisions on the composition, methodology, and related matters of \nan index underlying a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares, must implement \nand maintain, or be subject to, procedures designed to prevent the use \nand dissemination of material non-public information regarding the \napplicable index. For actively managed Multi-Class ETFs, personnel who \nmake decisions on the portfolio composition must be subject to \nprocedures designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material \nnonpublic information regarding the applicable portfolio.\n    Proposed Rule 5703(d)(2) provides that each series of Multi-Class \nETF Shares will be listed and traded on the Exchange subject to \napplication of the continued listing criteria therein. Proposed Rule \n5703(d)(2)(A) provides that the Exchange will consider the suspension \nof trading in, and will initiate delisting proceedings under the Rule \n5800 Series of, a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares under any of the \nfollowing circumstances: (i) if the Exchange becomes aware that the \nissuer of the Multi-Class ETF Shares is no longer in compliance with \nthe requirements of Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act or of \nthe applicable exemptive relief applicable to Muti-Class ETF Shares; \n(ii) if any of the other listing requirements set forth\n\n[[Page 22376]]\n\nin this Rule are not continuously maintained; (iii) if, following the \ninitial twelve month period after commencement of trading on the \nExchange of a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares, there are fewer than 50 \nbeneficial holders of the series of Multi-Class ETF Shares for 30 or \nmore consecutive trading days; or (iv) if such other event shall occur \nor condition exists which, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes \nfurther dealings on the Exchange inadvisable. Proposed Rule \n5703(d)(2)(B) provides that upon termination of an investment company, \nthe Exchange requires that Multi-Class ETF Shares issued in connection \nwith such entity be removed from Exchange listing.\n    Proposed Rule 5703(e) provides that neither the Exchange, the \nReporting Authority, nor any agent of the Exchange shall have any \nliability for damages, claims, losses or expenses caused by any errors, \nomissions, or delays in calculating or disseminating any current index \nor portfolio value; the current value of the portfolio of securities \nrequired to be deposited in connection with issuance of Multi-Class ETF \nShares; the amount of any dividend equivalent payment or cash \ndistribution to holders of Multi-Class ETF Shares; net asset value; or \nother information relating to the purchase, redemption, or trading of \nMulti-Class ETF Shares, resulting from any negligent act or omission by \nthe Exchange, the Reporting Authority, or any agent of the Exchange, or \nany act, condition, or cause beyond the reasonable control of the \nExchange, its agent, or the Reporting Authority, including, but not \nlimited to, an act of God; fire; flood; extraordinary weather \nconditions; war; insurrection; riot; strike; accident; action of \ngovernment; communications or power failure; equipment or software \nmalfunction; or any error, omission, or delay in the reports of \ntransactions in one or more underlying securities.\n    The Exchange is also proposing to make corresponding amendments to \ninclude Multi-Class ETF Shares in other Exchange rules, which are \nintended to align the treatment of the proposed products with how other \nopen-end management investment company shares (e.g., Exchange Traded \nFund Shares, Index Fund Shares, and Managed Fund Shares) are treated \nunder the Exchange's rules. First, the Exchange proposes to amend the \ndefinition of ``Derivative Securities'' in Rule 5615(a)(6)(B) to add \nMulti-Class ETF Shares so that Rule 5615(a)(6)(A) and its exemptions \nfrom certain corporate governance requirements are applicable to Multi-\nClass ETF Shares.\\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ Rule 5615(a)(6)(A) provides that issuers whose only \nsecurities listed on Nasdaq are non-voting preferred securities, \ndebt securities or Derivative Securities, are exempt from the \nrequirements relating to Independent Directors (as set forth in Rule \n5605(b)), Compensation Committees (as set forth in Rule 5605(d)), \nDirector Nominations (as set forth in Rule 5605(e)), Codes of \nConduct (as set forth in Rule 5610), and Meetings of Shareholders \n(as set forth in Rule 5620(a)). In addition, these issuers are \nexempt from the requirements relating to Audit Committees (as set \nforth in Rule 5605(c)), except for the applicable requirements of \nSEC Rule 10A-3. Notwithstanding, if the issuer also lists its common \nstock or voting preferred stock, or their equivalent on Nasdaq it \nwill be subject to all the requirements of the Nasdaq 5600 Rule \nSeries.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Second, the Exchange proposes to amend the definition of \n``Derivative Securities Products in Rule 5705(b)(3)(A)(i)a. to add \nMulti-Class ETF Shares so the exclusions applicable to Derivative \nSecurities Products in Nasdaq Rule 5705(b)(3)(A) will also apply to \nMulti-Class ETF Shares. The Exchange believes this is appropriate to \nensure that Multi-Class ETF Shares are treated consistently with other \nopen-end management investment company shares listed on the Exchange \nsuch as Exchange Traded Fund Shares, Index Fund Shares, and Managed \nFund Shares.\n    Third, the Exchange proposes to amend the definition of ``Exchange \nTraded Derivative Securities'' in Rule 5735(c)(6) to add Multi-Class \nETF Shares so the exclusions applicable to Exchange Traded Derivative \nSecurities in Rule 5735(b)(1)(A) will also apply to Multi-Class ETF \nShares. The Exchange believes this is appropriate to ensure that Multi-\nClass ETF Shares are treated consistently with other open-end \nmanagement investment company shares listed on the Exchange such as \nExchange Traded Fund Shares, Index Fund Shares, and Managed Fund \nShares.\n    Fourth, the Exchange proposes to amend Equity 4, Rule 4120 to \ninclude Multi-Class ETF Shares in the Exchange's trading halt \nprovisions in Rule 4120(a)(9) and 4120(b)(4)(A).\\16\\ This will ensure \nthe applicability of trading halts to the trading of Multi-Class ETF \nShares listed on Nasdaq, and those traded on Nasdaq pursuant to \nunlisted trading privileges.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ Rule 4120(b)(4)(A) sets out the definition of ``Derivative \nSecurities Product,'' which is referenced in the Exchange's halt \nauthority pursuant to Rules 4120(a)(10) and 4120(b).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDiscussion\n    Proposed Rule 5703 is based in large part on Rules 5704, 5705(b), \nand 5735, related to the listing and trading of ETF Shares, Index Fund \nShares, and Managed Fund Shares, respectively, each of which are issued \nunder the Investment Company Act and qualify as ETF Shares under Rule \n6c-11. Rules 5705(b) and 5735 are very similar, their primary \ndifference being that Index Fund Shares are designed to track an \nunderlying index and Managed Fund Shares are based on an actively \nmanaged portfolio that is not designed to track an index. ETF Shares \nare identical to Multi-Class ETF Shares except that Multi-Class ETF \nShares have received exemptive relief to operate an exchange-traded \nfund class in addition to classes of shares that are not exchange-\ntraded. As such, the Exchange believes that using Rules 5705(b) and \n5735 (collectively, the ``Current ETF Standards'') as well as Rule 5704 \nas the basis for proposed Rule 5703 is appropriate because they are \ngenerally designed to address the issues associated with Multi-Class \nETF Shares. The only substantial difference between Rule 5704 and \nproposed Rule 5703 from the Current ETF Standards that are not \notherwise required under Rule 6c-11 is that proposed Rule 5703 and Rule \n5704 do not include the quantitative standards applicable to a fund or \nan index that are included in the Current ETF Standards. This \ndifference is discussed below.\n    The Exchange believes that the proposal is designed to prevent \nfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices because the Exchange \nwill perform ongoing surveillance of Multi-Class ETF Shares listed on \nthe Exchange in order to ensure compliance with Rule 6c-11, the \nInvestment Company Act, and any applicable exemptive relief on an \nongoing basis. While proposed Rule 5703 does not include the \nquantitative requirements applicable to an ETF or an ETF's holdings or \nunderlying index that are included in Rules 5705(b) and 5735,\\17\\ the \nExchange believes that the manipulation concerns that such standards \nare intended to address are otherwise mitigated by a combination of the \nExchange's surveillance procedures, the Exchange's ability to halt \ntrading under the proposed Rule 5703(d)(2)(B), and the Exchange's \nability to suspend trading and commence delisting proceedings under \nproposed Rule 5703(d)(2)(A). The Exchange will halt\n\n[[Page 22377]]\n\ntrading in the Shares under the conditions specified in Nasdaq Rules \n4120 and 4121, including without limitation the conditions specified in \nNasdaq Rule 4120(a)(9) and (10) and under Nasdaq Rules 4120(a)(12). The \nExchange also believes that such concerns are further mitigated by \nenhancements to the arbitrage mechanism that have come from Rule 6c-11, \nspecifically the additional flexibility provided to issuers of Multi-\nClass ETF Shares through the use of custom baskets for creations and \nredemptions and the additional information made available to the public \nthrough the additional daily website disclosure obligations applicable \nunder Rule 6c-11.\\18\\ The Exchange believes that the combination of \nthese factors will act to keep Multi-Class ETF Shares trading near the \nvalue of their underlying holdings and further mitigate concerns around \nmanipulation of Multi-Class ETF Shares on the Exchange without the \ninclusion of quantitative standards.\\19\\ The Exchange will monitor for \ncompliance with Rule 6c-11 and any applicable exemptive relief in order \nto ensure that the continued listing standards are being met.\\20\\ \nSpecifically, the Exchange will review the website of each series of \nMulti-Class ETF Shares listed on the Exchange in order to ensure that \nthe requirements of Rule 6c-11 are being met. The Exchange will also \nemploy numerous intraday alerts that will notify Exchange personnel of \ntrading activity throughout the day that is potentially indicative of \ncertain disclosures not being made accurately or the presence of other \nunusual conditions or circumstances that could be detrimental to the \nmaintenance of a fair and orderly market. As a backstop to the \nsurveillances described above, the Exchange also notes that Rule 5703 \nwould require an issuer of Multi-Class ETF Shares to notify the \nExchange of any failure to comply with Rule 6c-11 or the Investment \nCompany Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ The Exchange notes that Rules 5705(b) and 5735 include \ncertain quantitative standards related to the size, trading volume, \nconcentration, and diversity of the holdings of a series of Index \nFund Shares or Managed Fund Shares (the ``Holdings Standards'') as \nwell as related to the minimum number of beneficial holders of a \nfund (the ``Distribution Standards''). The Exchange believes that to \nthe extent that manipulation concerns are mitigated based on the \nfactors described herein, such concerns are mitigated both as it \nrelates to the Holdings Standards and the Distribution Standards.\n    \\18\\ The Exchange notes that the Commission came to a similar \nconclusion in several places in the Rule 6c-11 Release. See Rule 6c-\n11 Release at 15-18; 60-61; 69-70; 78-79; 82-84; and 95-96.\n    \\19\\ The Exchange believes that this applies to all quantitative \nstandards, whether applicable to the portfolio holdings of a series \nof Multi-Class ETF Shares or the distribution of the Multi-Class ETF \nShares.\n    \\20\\ As noted throughout, proposed Rule 5703, unlike Rule \n5705(b) and Rule 5735, does not include Holdings Standards and, as \nsuch, there will be no quantitative standards applicable by the \nExchange to the portfolio holdings of a series of Multi-Class ETF \nShares on an initial or continued listing basis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange may suspend trading in and commence delisting \nproceedings for a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares where such series is \nnot in compliance with the applicable listing standards or where the \nExchange believes that further dealings on the Exchange are \ninadvisable.\\21\\ The Exchange also notes that Rule 5701(d) requires any \nissuer to provide the Exchange with prompt notification after it \nbecomes aware of any non-compliance with proposed Rule 5703, which \nwould include any failure of the issuer to comply with Rule 6c-11, the \nInvestment Company Act, or any exemptive relief applicable to Multi-\nClass ETF Shares.\\22\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ Specifically, proposed Rule 5703(d)(2) provides that each \nseries of Multi-Class ETF Shares will be listed and traded on the \nExchange subject to application of Proposed Rule 5703(d)(2)(A) and \n(B). Proposed Rule 5703(d)(2)(A) provides that the Exchange will \nconsider the suspension of trading in, and will commence delisting \nproceedings under the Rule 5800 Series of, a series of Multi-Class \nETF Shares under any of the following circumstances: (i) if the \nExchange becomes aware that the issuer of the Multi-Class ETF Shares \nis no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the \nInvestment Company Act of 1940 or any applicable exemptive relief \napplicable to Multi-Class ETF Shares; (ii) if any of the other \nlisting requirements set forth in this Rule are not continuously \nmaintained; (iii) if, following the initial twelve month period \nafter commencement of trading on the Exchange of a series of Multi-\nClass ETF Shares, there are fewer than 50 beneficial holders of the \nseries of Multi-Class ETF Shares for 30 or more consecutive trading \ndays; or (iv) if such other event shall occur or condition exists \nwhich, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes further dealings on the \nExchange inadvisable. Proposed Rule 5703(d)(2)(B) provides that upon \ntermination of an investment company, the Exchange requires that \nMulti-Class ETF Shares issued in connection with such entity be \nremoved from Exchange listing.\n    \\22\\ The Exchange notes that failure by an issuer to notify the \nExchange of non-compliance pursuant to Rule 5701(d) would itself be \nconsidered non-compliance with the requirements of proposed Rule \n5703 and would subject the series of Multi-Class ETF Shares to \npotential trading halts and the delisting process under the Rule \n5800 Series.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, the Exchange also represents that its surveillance \nprocedures are adequate to properly monitor the trading of the Multi-\nClass ETF Shares in all trading sessions and to deter and detect \nviolations of Exchange rules and applicable federal securities laws. \nSpecifically, the Exchange intends to utilize its existing surveillance \nprocedures applicable to derivative products, which are currently \napplicable to ETF Shares, Index Fund Shares and Managed Fund Shares, \namong other product types, to monitor trading in Multi-Class ETF \nShares. The Exchange or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, \nInc. (``FINRA''), on behalf of the Exchange, will communicate as needed \nregarding trading in Multi-Class ETF Shares and certain of their \napplicable underlying components with other markets that are members of \nthe Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') or with which the Exchange \nhas in place a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. In \naddition, the Exchange may obtain information regarding trading in \nMulti-Class ETF Shares and certain of their applicable underlying \ncomponents from markets and other entities that are members of ISG or \nwith which the Exchange has in place a comprehensive surveillance \nsharing agreement. Finally, the issuer of a series of Multi-Class ETF \nShares will be required to comply with Rule 10A-3 under the Act for the \ninitial and continued listing of Multi-Class ETF Shares, as provided \nunder Rule 5615(a)(6).\\23\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ See supra note 15. The Exchange notes that these proposed \nchanges in Rule 5615(a)(6)(B) would subject ETF Shares to the same \ncorporate governance requirements as other open-end management \ninvestment companies listed on the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes that it may consider all relevant factors in \nexercising its discretion to halt or suspend trading in a series of \nMulti-Class ETF Shares. Trading may be halted if the circuit breaker \nparameters in Rule 4121 have been reached, because of other market \nconditions, or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make \ntrading in the Shares inadvisable. These may include: (1) the extent to \nwhich certain information about the Multi-Class ETF Shares that is \nrequired to be disclosed under Rule 6c-11 of the Investment Company Act \nis not being made available, including specifically where the Exchange \nbecomes aware that the net asset value or the daily portfolio \ndisclosure with respect to a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares is not \ndisseminated to all market participants at the same time, it will halt \ntrading in such series until such time as the net asset value or the \ndaily portfolio disclosure is available to all market participants; \n\\24\\ (2) if an interruption to the dissemination to the value of the \nindex or reference asset on which a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares is \nbased persists past the trading day in which it occurred or is no \nlonger calculated or available; (3) trading in the securities \ncomprising the underlying index or portfolio has been halted in the \nprimary market(s); or (4) whether other unusual conditions or \ncircumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly \nmarket are present.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ The Exchange will obtain a representation from the issuer \nof Multi-Class ETF Shares that the net asset value per share will be \ncalculated daily and the requirements under 6c-11 will be satisfied \nfor the series will be calculated daily and made available to all \nmarket participants at the same time.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section \n6(b)\n\n[[Page 22378]]\n\nof the Act,\\25\\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Section \n6(b)(5) of the Act,\\26\\ in particular, in that it is designed to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments \nto and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national \nmarket system, and, in general to protect investors and the public \ninterest.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\26\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes that proposed Rule 5703 is designed to \nprevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in that the \nproposed rules relating to listing and trading Multi-Class ETF Shares \non the Exchange provide specific initial and continued listing criteria \nrequired to be met by such securities. Proposed Rule 5703(d) sets forth \ninitial and continued listing criteria applicable to Multi-Class ETF \nShares, specifically providing that the Exchange may approve a series \nof Multi-Class ETF Shares for listing and/or trading (including \npursuant to unlisted trading privileges) on the Exchange pursuant to \nRule 19b-4(e) under the Act, provided such series of Multi-Class ETF \nShares complies with the requirements of Rule 6c-11 under the \nInvestment Company Act, and is eligible to operate in reliance on \nexemptive relief from certain requirements of the Investment Company \nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder that permits the fund to \noffer Multi-Class ETF Shares, and must satisfy the requirements of this \nRule on an initial and continued listing basis.\\27\\ The Exchange will \nsubmit a Form 19b-4(e) for all series of Multi-Class ETF Shares upon \nbeing listed pursuant to Rule 5703 and such Form 19b-4(e) will \nspecifically note that such series of Multi-Class ETF Shares are being \nlisted on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 5703.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\27\\ The Exchange notes that eligibility to operate in reliance \non Rule 6c-11 or any applicable exemptive relief thereunder does not \nnecessarily mean that an investment company would be listed on the \nExchange pursuant to proposed Rule 5703. To this point, an \ninvestment company that operates in reliance of exemptive relief \nproviding for Multi-Class ETF Shares could also be listed as a \nseries of Index Fund Shares or Managed Fund Shares pursuant to Rule \n5705(b) or 5735, respectively, and would be subject to all \nrequirements under each of those rules. Further to this point, in \nthe event that a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares listed on the \nExchange preferred to be listed as a series of Index Fund Shares or \nManaged Fund Shares (as applicable), nothing would preclude such a \nseries from changing to be listed as a series of Index Fund Shares \nor Managed Fund Shares (as applicable), as long as the series met \neach of the initial and continued listing obligations under the \napplicable rules.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Proposed Rule 5704(d)(2) [sic] provides that each series of Multi-\nClass ETF Shares will be listed and traded on the Exchange subject to \napplication of proposed Rules 5704(d)(2)(A) [sic] and (B). Proposed \nRule 5704(d)(2)(A) [sic] provides that the Exchange will consider the \nsuspension of trading in, and will commence delisting proceedings under \nthe Rule 5800 Series of, a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares under any \nof the following circumstances: (i) if the Exchange becomes aware that \nthe issuer of the Multi-Class ETF Shares is no longer in compliance \nwith the requirements of Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act of \n1940 or the exemptive relief applicable to Multi-Class ETF Shares; (ii) \nif any of the other listing requirements set forth in this Rule \n14.11(n) are not continuously maintained; (iii) if, following the \ninitial twelve month period after commencement of trading on the \nExchange of a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares, there are fewer than 50 \nbeneficial holders of the series of Multi-Class ETF Shares for 30 or \nmore consecutive trading days; or (d) if such other event shall occur \nor condition exists which, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes \nfurther dealings on the Exchange inadvisable. The Exchange notes that \nit may become aware that the issuer is no longer compliant with Rule \n6c-11 or any applicable exemptive relief thereunder, as described in \nproposed Rule 5703(d)(2)(A)(i), as a result of either the Exchange \nidentifying non-compliance through its own monitoring process or \nthrough notification by the issuer.\n    Proposed Rule 5703(d)(2)(B) provides that upon termination of an \ninvestment company, the Exchange requires that Multi-Class ETF Shares \nissued in connection with such entity be removed from Exchange listing. \nThe Exchange also notes that it will obtain a representation from the \nissuer of each series of Multi-Class ETF Shares stating that the \nrequirements of Rule 6c-11 will be continuously satisfied and that the \nissuer will notify the Exchange of any failure to do so.\n    The Exchange further believes that proposed Rule 5703 is designed \nto prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices because of \nthe robust surveillances in place on the Exchange as required under \nproposed Rule 5703(b)(2) along with the similarities of proposed Rule \n5703 to the rules related to other securities that are already listed \nand traded on the Exchange and which would qualify as Multi-Class ETF \nShares. Proposed Rule 5703 is based in large part on Rules 5705(b) and \n5735 related to the listing and trading of Index Fund Shares and \nManaged Fund Shares on the Exchange, respectively, both of which are \nissued under the 1940 Act and would qualify as Multi-Class ETF Shares. \nRules 5705(b) and 5735 are very similar, their primary difference being \nthat Index Fund Shares are designed to track an underlying index and \nManaged Fund Shares are based on an actively managed portfolio that is \nnot designed to track an index. ETF Shares are identical to Multi-Class \nETF Shares except that Multi-Class ETF Shares have received exemptive \nrelief to operate an exchange-traded fund class in addition to classes \nof shares that are not exchange-traded. As such, the Exchange believes \nthat using the Current ETF Standards and Rule 5704 as the basis for \nproposed Rule 5703 is appropriate because they are generally designed \nto address the issues associated with Multi-Class ETF Shares. The only \nsubstantial difference between proposed Rule 5703 and the Current ETF \nStandards that are not otherwise required under Rule 6c-11 is that \nproposed Rule 5703 does not include the quantitative standards \napplicable to a fund or an index that are included in the Current ETF \nStandards.\n    The Exchange believes that the proposal is consistent with Section \n6(b)(1) of the Act \\28\\ in that, in addition to being designed to \nprevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, the Exchange \nhas the capacity to enforce proposed Rule 5703 by performing ongoing \nsurveillance of Multi-Class ETF Shares listed on the Exchange in order \nto ensure compliance with Rule 6c-11 and the 1940 Act on an ongoing \nbasis. While proposed Rule 5703 does not include the quantitative \nrequirements applicable to a fund and a fund's holdings or underlying \nindex that are included in Rules 5705(b) and 5735,\\29\\ the Exchange \nbelieves that the manipulation concerns that such standards are \nintended to address are otherwise mitigated by a combination of the \nExchange's surveillance procedures, the Exchange's ability to halt \ntrading under the proposed Rule 5703(d)(2)(B), and the Exchange's \nability to suspend trading and commence delisting proceedings under \nproposed Rule 5703(d)(2)(A). The Exchange also believes that such \nconcerns are further mitigated by enhancements to the arbitrage \nmechanism that have come from compliance with Rule 6c-11, specifically \nthe additional flexibility provided to issuers of Multi-Class ETF\n\n[[Page 22379]]\n\nShares through the use of custom baskets for creations and redemptions \nand the additional information made available to the public through the \nadditional daily website disclosure obligations applicable under Rule \n6c-11.\\30\\ The Exchange believes that the combination of these factors \nwill act to keep Multi-Class ETF Shares trading near the value of their \nunderlying holdings and further mitigate concerns around manipulation \nof Multi-Class ETF Shares on the Exchange without the inclusion of \nquantitative standards.\\31\\ The Exchange will monitor for compliance \nwith Rule 6c-11 and any applicable exemptive relief in order to ensure \nthat the continued listing standards are being met. Specifically, the \nExchange plans to review the website of series of Multi-Class ETF \nShares in order to ensure that the requirements of Rule 6c-11 are being \nmet. The Exchange will also employ numerous intraday alerts that will \nnotify Exchange personnel of trading activity throughout the day that \nis potentially indicative of certain disclosures not being made \naccurately or the presence of other unusual conditions or circumstances \nthat could be detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly \nmarket. As a backstop to the surveillances described above, the \nExchange also notes that Rule 5701(d) would require an issuer of Multi-\nClass ETF Shares to notify the Exchange of any failure to comply with \nRule 6c-11 or the Investment Company Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(1).\n    \\29\\ The Exchange notes that Rules 5705(b) and 5735 include \ncertain Holdings Standards and Distribution Standards. The Exchange \nbelieves that to the extent that manipulation concerns are mitigated \nbased on the factors described herein, such concerns are mitigated \nboth as it relates to the Holdings Standards and the Distribution \nStandards.\n    \\30\\ The Exchange notes that the Commission came to a similar \nconclusion in several places in the Rule 6c-11 Release. See Rule 6c-\n11 Release at 15-18; 60-61; 69-70; 78-79; 82-84; and 95-96.\n    \\31\\ The Exchange believes that this applies to all quantitative \nstandards, whether applicable to the portfolio holdings of a series \nof Multi-Class ETF Shares or the distribution of the Multi-Class ETF \nShares.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    To the extent that any of the requirements under Rule 6c-11 or the \n1940 Act are not being met, the Exchange may halt trading in a series \nof Multi-Class ETF Shares as provided in proposed Rule 5703(d)(2)(B). \nFurther, the Exchange may also suspend trading in and commence \ndelisting proceedings for a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares where such \nseries is not in compliance with the applicable listing standards or \nwhere the Exchange believes that further dealings on the Exchange are \ninadvisable. As discussed above, the Exchange also notes that Rule \n5701(d) requires any issuer to provide the Exchange with prompt \nnotification after it becomes aware of any non-compliance with proposed \nRule 5703, which would include any failure of the issuer to comply with \nRule 6c-11 or the 1940 Act.\n    Further, the Exchange also represents that its surveillance \nprocedures are adequate to properly monitor the trading of the Multi-\nClass ETF Shares in all trading sessions and to deter and detect \nviolations of Exchange rules. Specifically, the Exchange intends to \nutilize its existing surveillance procedures applicable to derivative \nproducts, which are currently applicable to Index Fund Shares, Managed \nFund Shares and ETF Shares, among other product types, to monitor \ntrading in Multi-Class ETF Shares. The Exchange or FINRA, on behalf of \nthe Exchange, will communicate as needed regarding trading in Multi-\nClass ETF Shares and certain of their applicable underlying components \nwith other markets that are members of the ISG or with which the \nExchange has in place a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. \nIn addition, the Exchange may obtain information regarding trading in \nMulti-Class ETF Shares and certain of their applicable underlying \ncomponents from markets and other entities that are members of ISG or \nwith which the Exchange has in place a comprehensive surveillance \nsharing agreement.\n    Additionally, FINRA, on behalf of the Exchange, is able to access, \nas needed, trade information for certain fixed income securities that \nmay be held by a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares reported to FINRA's \nTRACE. FINRA also can access data obtained from the MSRB's EMMA system \nrelating to municipal bond trading activity for surveillance purposes \nin connection with trading in a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares, to \nthe extent that a series of Multi-Class ETF Shares holds municipal \nsecurities. Finally, as noted above, the issuer of a series of Multi-\nClass ETF Shares will be required to comply with Rule 10A-3 under the \nAct for the initial and continued listing of Multi-Class ETF Shares, as \nprovided under Rule 5615(a)(6).\\32\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ See supra notes 15 and 23.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes that permitting Multi-Class ETF Shares to \nlist on the Exchange is consistent with the applicable exemptive relief \nand will help perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and, in \ngeneral, will protect investors and the public interest in that it will \npermit the listing and trading of Multi-Class ETF Shares, consistent \nwith the applicable exemptive relief, and in a manner that will benefit \ninvestors. Specifically, the Exchange believes that the relief proposed \nin the Applications and the expected benefits of the Multi-Class ETF \nShares described above would be to the benefit of investors. \nEliminating any unnecessary delay for additional Multi-Class ETF Shares \nlisting on the Exchange under proposed Rule 5703 will simply help \naccrue those benefits to investors more expeditiously. Further, the \nExchange is only proposing to amend its rules to allow such a series of \nMulti-Class ETF Shares to list on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 5703, a \nchange to its rules that will only be meaningful if and when the \nCommission grants such relief to an Applicant. As noted above, the \nExchange submits this proposal only to prevent any unnecessary delay in \nlisting additional Multi-Class ETF Shares generically under Rule 5703 \nwhen and if such requests are granted by the Commission.\n    The Exchange also believes that proposed Rule 5703 to explicitly \nprovide the initial and continued listing standards applicable to \nMulti-Class ETF Shares, including the suspension of trading or removal \nstandards, are designed to promote transparency and clarity in the \nExchange's Rules. The Exchange believes that with these changes, Rule \n5703 would clearly allow for the listing and trading of Multi-Class ETF \nShares upon the Commission's order of exemptive relief.\n    The Exchange also believes that the corresponding changes to add \nMulti-Class ETF Shares in the Exchange's corporate governance \nrequirements under Rule 5615(a)(6)(B), the Index Fund Shares provisions \nin Rule 5705(b), the Managed Fund Shares provisions in Rule 5735, and \nthe trading halt provisions in Equity 4, Rule 4120, each as discussed \nin detail above, will add clarity to the Exchange's Rulebook. ETF \nShares, Managed Fund Shares, and Index Fund Shares are similarly \nincluded in these provisions. Therefore, the Exchange believes these \nare non-substantive changes meant only to subject Multi-Class ETF \nShares to the same exemptions and provisions currently applicable to \nIndex Fund Shares, Managed Fund Shares, and ETF Shares so that the \ntreatment of these open-end management investment companies is \nconsistent under the Exchange's rules.\n    For the above reasons, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the \nAct.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition not\n\n[[Page 22380]]\n\nnecessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The \nExchange believes the proposal, by permitting the listing and trading \nof Multi-Class ETF Shares under exemptive relief from the Investment \nCompany Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, would introduce \nadditional competition among various ETF products to the benefit of \ninvestors.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were either solicited or received.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    Within 45 days of the date of publication of this notice in the \nFederal Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the \nCommission may designate if it finds such longer period to be \nappropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to \nwhich the Exchange consents, the Commission shall: (a) by order approve \nor disapprove such proposed rule change, or (b) institute proceedings \nto determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.\n\nIV. Solicitation of Comments\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and \narguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with the Act.

The text of the proposed rule change is provided in \nExhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/ctwo/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/ctwo/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at \nthe Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change.

Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule relating to \nphysical connectivity fees.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange initially filed the proposed fee changes on \nJuly 3, 2023 (SR-C2-2023-014).

The Exchange currently assesses the \nfollowing physical connectivity fees for Trading Permit Holders \n(``TPHs'') and non-TPHs on a monthly basis: $2,500 per physical port \nfor a 1 gigabit (``Gb'') circuit and $7,500 per physical port for a 10 \nGb circuit. The Exchange proposes to increase the monthly fee for 10 Gb \nphysical ports from $7,500 to $8,500 per port. The Exchange notes the \nproposed fee change better enables it to continue to maintain and \nimprove its market technology and services and also notes that the \nproposed fee amount, even as amended, continues to be in line with, or \neven lower than, amounts assessed by other exchanges for similar \nconnections.\\4\\ The Exchange also notes that a single 10 Gb physical \nport can be used to access the Systems of the following affiliate \nexchanges: the Cboe BYX Exchange, Inc., Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. \n(options and equities platforms), Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (options and \nequities platforms), and Cboe EDGA Exchange, Inc., (``Affiliate \nExchanges'').\\5\\ Notably, only one monthly fee currently (and will \ncontinue) to apply per 10 Gb physical port regardless of how many \naffiliated exchanges are accessed through that one port.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See e.g., The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), General \n8, Connectivity to the Exchange. Nasdaq and its affiliated exchanges \ncharge a monthly fee of $16,500 for each 10 Gb Ultra fiber \nconnection to the respective exchange. See also New York Stock \nExchange LLC, NYSE American LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc., NYSE Chicago Inc., \nNYSE National, Inc. Connectivity Fee Schedule, which provides that \n10 Gb LX LCN Circuits (which are analogous to the Exchange's 10 Gb \nphysical port) are assessed $22,000 per month, per port.\n    \\5\\ The Affiliate Exchanges are also submitting contemporaneous \nidentical rule filings.\n    \\6\\ The Exchange notes that conversely, other exchange groups \ncharge separate port fees for access to separate, but affiliated, \nexchanges. See e.g., Securities and Exchange Release No. 99822 \n(March 21, 2024), 89 FR 21337 (March 27, 2024) (SR-MIAX-2024-016).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\7\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\8\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\9\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) \\10\\ of the Act, which \nrequires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of \nreasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other \npersons using its facilities. This belief is based on various factors \nas described below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\8\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\9\\ Id.\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    First, the Exchange believes its proposal is reasonable as it \nreflects a moderate increase in physical connectivity fees for 10 Gb \nphysical ports and its offering, even as amended, continues to be more \naffordable as compared to analogous physical connectivity offerings at \ncompetitor exchanges. For example, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC \n(``Nasdaq'') and its affiliated exchanges charge a monthly fee of \n$16,500 for each 10 Gbps Ultra fiber connection and $11,000 per month \nfor each 10 Gbps fiber connection to their respective exchange.\\11\\ The \nExchange's proposed fee of $8,500 per physical port is lower than both \nof these offerings.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), General 8, \nConnectivity to the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Yet another example of higher fees charged by a competitor exchange \nis the 10 Gpbs LX LCN Circuits offered by the New York Stock Exchange \nLLC and its affiliates (collectively, ``NYSE''). NYSE charges a fee of \n$22,000 per month,\\12\\ per port in contrast to the Exchange's proposed \nmonthly fee of $8,500 per month, per port. Despite the Exchange \nproposing to increase its fee for its 10 Gb physical port, it still \ncomes in at a cost significantly lower than its competitors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See New York Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE American LLC, NYSE \nArca, Inc., NYSE Chicago Inc., NYSE National, Inc. Connectivity Fee \nSchedule\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Lastly, the Exchange also points towards the equivalent offering \nfrom MIAX Saphire and its affiliated options exchanges, MIAX Options, \nMIAX Pearl and MIAX Emerald (collectively, ``MIAX Exchanges'') which is \n$13,500 per port per month.\\13\\ The Exchange reiterates that a single \nphysical port offering from the Exchange offers the ability to connect \nto the Affiliated Exchanges (equities and options) and the monthly \nprice does not change based on the number of exchanges a participant is \nconnected to. In this case, examining only the Exchange and its \nAffiliated Options Exchanges, (even though the same physical port could \nalso connect to the Exchange's affiliated equities exchanges) a \nparticipant could purchase a single physical port from the Exchange and \naccess roughly 14% of the U.S. Options Market for a cost of $8,500. In \ncontrast, if a participant desired to access all MIAX Exchanges, \nallowing access to roughly 16% of the U.S. Options Market, it would \ncost that participant $54,000 ($13,500 per port per month x 4 MIAX \nExchanges).\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See e.g., MIAX Options Fee Schedule.\n    \\14\\ See Cboe U.S. Options Market Volume Summary (May 8, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes the current fee does not properly \nreflect the quality of the service and product, as fees for 10 Gb \nphysical ports have been static in nominal terms since 2018, and \ntherefore falling in real terms due to inflation. As a general matter, \nthe Producer Price Index (``PPI'') is a family of indexes that measures \nthe average change over time in selling prices received by domestic \nproducers of goods and services. PPI measures price change from the \nperspective of the seller. This contrasts with other metrics, such as \nthe Consumer Price Index (CPI), that measure price change from the \npurchaser's perspective.\\15\\ About 10,000 PPIs for individual products \nand groups of products are tracked and released each month.\\16\\ PPIs \nare available for the output of nearly all industries in the goods-\nproducing sectors of the U.S. economy--mining, manufacturing, \nagriculture, fishing, and forestry--as well as natural gas, \nelectricity, and construction, among others. The PPI program covers \napproximately 69 percent of the service sector's output, as measured by \nrevenue reported in the 2017 Economic Census.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>.\n    \\16\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For purposes of this proposal, the relevant industry-specific PPI \nis the Data Processing, hosting and related services (``Data PPI'') and \nmore particularly the more granular service line Data Processing, \nHosting and Related Services: Hosting, Active Server Pages (ASP), and \nOther Information\n\n[[Page 22382]]\n\nTechnology (IT) Infrastructure Provisioning Services.\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Provisioning is the process of preparing, assigning, and \nactivating IT infrastructure components, such as servers, storage, \nand network connectivity, according to user requirements. It is a \ncritical part of IT operations, as it ensures that computing \nresources are available when needed and that they are set up and \nconnected to work correctly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Data PPI was introduced in January 2002 by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics (``BLS'') as part of an ongoing effort to expand Producer \nPrice Index coverage of the services sector of the U.S. economy and is \nidentified as NAICS--518210 in the North American Industry \nClassification System (``NAICS'').\\18\\ According to the BLS ``[t]he \nprimary output of NAICS 518210 is the provision of electronic data \nprocessing services. In the broadest sense, computer services companies \nhelp their customers efficiently use technology. The processing \nservices market consists of vendors who use their own computer \nsystems--often utilizing proprietary software--to process customers' \ntransactions and data. Price movements for the NAICS 518210 index are \nbased on changes in the revenue received by companies that provide data \nprocessing services and price movements for the service line NAICS \n518210 index are based on changes in the revenue received by companies \nthat provide, among other things, IT infrastructure provisioning \nservices. Each month, companies provide net transaction prices for a \nspecified service. The transaction is an actual contract selected by \nprobability, where the price-determining characteristics are held \nconstant while the service is repriced. The prices used in index \ncalculation are the actual prices billed for the selected service \ncontract.'' \\19\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>. Among the \nindustry-specific PPIs is for North American Industry Classification \nSystem (``NAICS'') Code 518210: ``Data Processing and Related \nServices,'' NAICS index codes categorize products and services that \nare common to particular industries. According to BLS, these codes \n``provide comparability with a wide assortment of industry-based \ndata for other economic programs, including productivity, \nproduction, employment, wages, and earnings.''\n    \\19\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-services-industry-naics-518210.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-services-industry-naics-518210.htm</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The service (product) lines for which price indexes are available \nunder the Data PPI are: (1) business process management services (2) \ndata management and storage information transformation and other \nservices and (3) hosting ASP and other IT infrastructure provisioning \nservices. The most apt of these industry and product specific \ncategorizations for purposes of this present proposal to modify fees \nfor the 10 Gb physical port fee measures inflation for the provision of \ndata processing, hosting and related services as well as other \ninformation technology infrastructure provisioning services which BLS \nidentifies as identified as NAICS--5182105.\\20\\ The Exchange believes \nthat this measure of inflation is particularly appropriate because the \nExchange's connectivity services involve hosting and providing \nconnections to its customers' telecommunications and information \ntechnology equipment, as well as preparing, assigning, and activating \nIT infrastructure components, such as servers, storage, and network \nconnectivity. The Exchange also uses its ``proprietary software,'' \ni.e., its own proprietary matching engine software, to receive orders \non the Exchange's proprietary trading platform as well as to collect, \norganize, store and report customers' transactions. In other words, the \nExchange is in the business of data processing, hosting, ASP, and \nproviding other IT infrastructure provisioning services. Specifically, \nwithin this category, the Exchange points to the financial business \nprocess management services category under the umbrella of data \nprocessing.\\21\\ The financial business process management services is \ndescribed as ``providing a bundled service package that combines \ninformation-technology-intensive services with labor (manual or \nprofessional depending on the solution), machinery, and facilities to \nsupport, host and manage a financial business process for a client, \nsuch as financial transaction processing, credit card processing, \npayment services, and lending services.'' \\22\\ The Exchange's \nconnectivity service provides connections to its customers' \ntelecommunications and information technology equipment, as well as \npreparing, assigning, and activating IT infrastructure components to \nfacilitate the transmission of orders and receipt of financial \ntransactions for its customers' while connected to the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ See <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105\">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105</a>.\n    \\21\\ See <a href=\"https://voorburggroup.org/Documents/2018%20Rome/Papers/1014.pdf\">https://voorburggroup.org/Documents/2018%20Rome/Papers/1014.pdf</a>.\n    \\22\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, the Exchange believes that this specific index is best \nsuited to guide this price increase as it reflects the change in this \nspecific instance over the last seven years instead of looking at the \nunderlying components of the service. PPI has published broad guidance \nregarding price adjustments for contracts,\\23\\ and within this it noted \nthat contracting parties should choose an index or group of indexes \nthat represent the cost for providing a particular product or service, \nrather than an index for the product itself.\\24\\ While this helps a \ncontracting seller avoid a circumstance where it is unable to raise its \nprice for the product itself if the underlying components have \nincreased and the PPI for the product itself has not yet increased--\nthis is not the case here. The Exchange instead is using historical \ndata over a seven-year period as a reference point for its proposed \nincrease moving forward--underlying components that have increased over \nthe course of seven years have since (by and large) been reflected in \nthe product itself.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting-parties.htm#FOOT5\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting-parties.htm#FOOT5</a>.\n    \\24\\ ``For example, if an apparel manufacturer were contracting \nfor long-term purchases with a producer of finished fabrics, it \nwould be more advisable to tie the price adjustment clause to a PPI \nfor synthetic fibers, processed yarns and threads, or greige fabrics \n(raw fabric), rather than to a PPI for a type of finished fabric.'' \nId.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange further believes the Data PPI is an appropriate \nmeasure for purposes of the proposed rule change on the basis that it \nis a stable metric with limited volatility, unlike other consumer-side \ninflation metrics. In fact, the Data PPI has not experienced a greater \nthan 2.16% increase for any one calendar year period since Data PPI was \nintroduced into the PPI in January 2002. For example, the average \ncalendar year change from January 2002 to December 2023 was .62%, with \na cumulative increase of 15.67% over this 21-year period. The Exchange \nbelieves the Data PPI is considerably less volatile than other \ninflation metrics such as CPI, which has had individual calendar-year \nincreases of more than 6.5%, and a cumulative increase of over 73% over \nthe same period.\\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ See <a href=\"https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/\">https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As noted above, the current 10 Gb physical port fee remained \nunchanged for almost seven years, particularly since June 2018.\\26\\ \nSince its last increase almost 7 years ago however, there has been \nnotable inflation, including under the industry- and product-specific \nPPI, which as described above is a tailored measure of inflation. \nParticularly, the Hosting, ASP and other IT Infrastructure Provisioning \nServices inflation measure had a starting value of 102.2 in June 2018 \n(the month the Exchange started\n\n[[Page 22383]]\n\nassessing the current fee) and an ending value of 118.502 in January \n2025, representing a 16% increase.\\27\\ This indicates that companies \nwho are also in the hosting ASP and other IT infrastructure \nprovisioning services have generally increased prices for a specified \nservice covered under NAICS 5182105 by an average of 16% during this \nperiod.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\26\\ See Securities and Exchange Release No. 83455 (June 15, \n2018), 83 FR 28892 (June 21, 2018) (SR-C2-2018-014).\n    \\27\\ See <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105\">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes that it is reasonable to increase its \nfees to compensate for inflation because, over time, inflation has \ndegraded the value of each dollar that the Exchange collects in fees, \nsuch that the real revenue collected today is considerably less than \nthat same revenue collected in 2018. The impact of this inflationary \neffect is also independent of any change in the Exchange's costs in \nproviding its goods and services. The Exchange therefore believes that \nit is reasonable for it to offset, in part, this erosion in the value \nof the revenues it collects. Additionally, the Exchange historically \ndoes not increase fees every year notwithstanding inflation.\\28\\ Other \nexchanges have also filed for increases in certain fees, based in part \non comparisons to inflation.\\29\\ Accordingly, based on the above-\ndescribed percentage change based on an industry- and product-specific \ninflationary measure, and in conjunction with the rationale further \ndescribed above and below, the Exchange believes the proposed fee \nincrease is reasonable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ As the Exchange historically does not increase fees every \nyear notwithstanding inflation, the Exchange believes that the more \nspecific index is appropriate to look at as it is reflective of the \ncumulative increase over the course of almost seven years. While the \nPPI has published guidance that a broader index may be more helpful \nto reference in a contract to avoid large swings on a shorter \nduration (and to which such a swing over a brief duration may \ntrigger additional obligations), the Exchange, in contrast, is \ninstead looking forward to adjust its price to reflect changes in \nthe industry over the past seven years. See supra note 20.\n    \\29\\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-100994 \n(September 10, 2024), 89 FR 75612 (September 16, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-\n2024-79).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Next, the Exchange believes significant investments into, and \nenhanced performance of, the Exchange, in the years following the last \n10 Gb physical port fee increase support the reasonableness of the \nproposed fee increase. These investments enhanced the quality of its \nservices, as measured by, among other things, increased throughput and \nfaster processing speeds. Customers have therefore greatly benefitted \nfrom these investments, while the Exchange's ability to recoup its \ninvestments has been hampered.\n    For example, the Exchange and its affiliated exchanges recently \nlaunched a multi-year initiative to improve Cboe Exchange Platform \nperformance and capacity requirements to increase competitiveness, \nsupport growth and advance a consistent world class platform. The goal \nof the project, among other things, is to provide faster and more \nconsistent order handling and matching performance for options, while \nensuring quicker processing time and supporting increasing volumes and \ncapacity needs. For example, the Exchange recently performed switch \nhardware upgrades. Particularly, the Exchange replaced existing \ncustomer access switches with newer models, which the Exchange believes \nresulted in increased determinism. The recent switch upgrades also \nincreased the Exchange's capacity to accommodate more physical ports by \nnearly 50%. Network bandwidth was also increased nearly two-fold as a \nresult of the upgrades, which among other things, can lead to reduce \nmessage queuing. The Exchange also believes these newer models result \nin less natural variance in the processing of messages. The Exchange \nnotes that it incurred costs associated with purchasing and upgrading \nto these newer models, of which the Exchange has not otherwise passed \nthrough or offset.\n    As of April 1, 2024, market participants also having the option of \nconnecting to a new data center (i.e., Secaucus NY6 Data Center \n(``NY6'')), in addition to the current data centers at NY4 and NY5. The \nExchange made NY6 available in response to customer requests in \nconnection with their need for additional space and capacity. In order \nto make this space available, the Exchange expended significant \nresources to prepare this space, and will also incur ongoing costs with \nrespect to maintaining this offering, including costs related to power, \nspace, fiber, cabinets, panels, labor and maintenance of racks. The \nExchange also incurred a large cost with respect to ensuring NY6 would \nbe latency equalized, as it is for NY4 and NY5.\n    The Exchange also has made various other improvements since the \ncurrent physical port rates were adopted in 2018. For example, the \nExchange has updated its customer portal to provide more transparency \nwith respect to firms' respective connectivity subscriptions, enabling \nthem to better monitor, evaluate and adjust their connections based on \ntheir evolving business needs. The Exchange also performs proactive \naudits on a weekly basis to ensure that all customer cross connects \ncontinue to fall within allowable tolerances for Latency Equalized \nconnections. Accordingly, the Exchange expended, and will continue to \nexpend, resources to innovate and modernize technology so that it may \nbenefit its TPHs and continue to compete among other options markets. \nThe ability to continue to innovate with technology and offer new \nproducts to market participants allows the Exchange to remain \ncompetitive in the options space which currently has 18 registered \noptions markets and potential new entrants. If the Exchange were not \nable to assess incrementally higher fees for its connectivity, it would \neffectively impact how the Exchange manages its technology and hamper \nthe Exchange's ability to continue to invest in and fund access \nservices in a manner that allows it to meet existing and anticipated \naccess demands of market participants. Disapproval of fee changes such \nas the proposal herein, could also have the adverse effect of \ndiscouraging an exchange from improving its operations and implementing \ninnovative technology to the benefit of market participants if it \nbelieves the Commission would later prevent that exchange from \nrecouping costs and monetizing its operational enhancements, thus \nadversely impacting competition as well as the interests of market \nparticipants and investors.\n    Finally, the proposed fee is also the same as is concurrently being \nproposed for its Affiliate Exchanges. Further, TPHs are able to utilize \na single port to connect to all of its Affiliate Exchanges and will \nonly be charged one single fee (i.e., a market participant will only be \nassessed the proposed $8,500 even if it uses that physical port to \nconnect to the Exchange and another (or even all 6) of its Affiliate \nExchanges. Particularly, the Exchange believes the proposed monthly per \nport fee is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly discriminatory since \nas the Exchange has determined to not charge multiple fees for the same \nport. Indeed, the Exchange notes that several ports are in fact \npurchased and utilized across one or more of the Exchange's affiliated \nExchanges (and charged only once).\n    The Exchange also believes that the proposed fee change is not \nunfairly discriminatory because it would be assessed uniformly across \nall market participants that purchase the physical ports. The Exchange \nbelieves increasing the fee for 10 Gb physical ports and charging a \nhigher fee as compared to the 1 Gb physical port is equitable as the 1 \nGb physical port is 1/10th the size of the 10 Gb physical port and \ntherefore does not offer access to many of the products\n\n[[Page 22384]]\n\nand services offered by the Exchange (e.g., ability to receive certain \nmarket data products). Thus, the value of the 1 Gb alternative is lower \nthan the value of the 10 Gb alternative, when measured based on the \ntype of Exchange access it offers. Moreover, market participants that \npurchase 10 Gb physical ports utilize the most bandwidth and therefore \nconsume the most resources from the network. The Exchange also \nanticipates that firms that utilize 10 Gb ports will benefit the most \nfrom the Exchange's investment in offering NY6 as the Exchange \nanticipates there will be much higher quantities of 10 Gb physical \nports connecting from NY6 as compared to 1 Gb ports. Indeed, the \nExchange notes that 10 Gb physical ports account for approximately 90% \nof physical ports across the NY4, NY5, and NY6 data centers, and to \ndate, 80% of new port connections in NY6 are 10 Gb ports. As such, the \nExchange believes the proposed fee change for 10 Gb physical ports is \nreasonably and appropriately allocated.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed fee change will \nnot impact intramarket competition because it will apply to all \nsimilarly situated TPHs equally (i.e., all market participants that \nchoose to purchase the 10 Gb physical port). Additionally, the Exchange \ndoes not believe its proposed pricing will impose a barrier to entry to \nsmaller participants and notes that its proposed connectivity pricing \nis associated with relative usage of the various market participants. \nFor example, market participants with modest capacity needs can \ncontinue to buy the less expensive 1 Gb physical port (which cost is \nnot changing) or may choose to obtain access via a third-party re-\nseller. While pricing may be increased for the larger capacity physical \nports, such options provide far more capacity and are purchased by \nthose that consume more resources from the network. Accordingly, the \nproposed connectivity fees do not favor certain categories of market \nparticipants in a manner that would impose a burden on competition; \nrather, the allocation reflects the network resources consumed by the \nvarious size of market participants--lowest bandwidth consuming members \npay the least, and highest bandwidth consuming members pays the most.\n    The proposed fee change also does not impose a burden on \ncompetition or on other Self-Regulatory Organizations that is not \nnecessary or appropriate. As described above, the Exchange evaluated \nits proposed fee change using objective and stable metric with limited \nvolatility. Utilizing Data Processing PPI over a specified period of \ntime is a reasonable means of recouping a portion of the Exchange's \ninvestment in maintaining and enhancing the connectivity service \nidentified above. The Exchange believes utilizing Data Processing PPI, \na tailored measure of inflation, to increase certain connectivity fees \nto recoup the Exchange's investment in maintaining and enhancing its \nservices and products would not impose a burden on competition.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\30\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\31\\ \nthereunder.

Introduction\n\n    On September 27, 2024, New York Stock Exchange LLC (``NYSE'' or the \n``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') \\1\\ and Rule 19b-4 \nthereunder,\\2\\ a proposed rule change to amend Sections 802.02 and \n802.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (``Manual'') to provide that \nthe Exchange (1) will not review a compliance plan submitted by a \ndomestic or non-U.S. listed company that is determined to be below \ncompliance with a continued listing standard unless the company has \npaid in full all outstanding listing or annual fees due to the Exchange \nand will commence suspension and delisting procedures in accordance \nwith Section 804.00 of the Manual if such fees are not paid in full by \nthe plan submission deadline; or (2) with respect to any unpaid fees \nthat have become due and payable since the commencement of its plan \nperiod, if such fees are not paid in full at the time of any required \nperiodic review of such plan, will commence suspension and delisting \nprocedures in accordance with Section 804.00 of the Manual. The \nproposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register \non October 16, 2024.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n    \\3\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101295 (Oct. 9, \n2024), 89 FR 83527 (``Notice''). Comment letters on the proposed \nrule change are available at: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nyse-2024-44/srnyse202444.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nyse-2024-44/srnyse202444.htm</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On November 25, 2024, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange \nAct,\\4\\ the Commission designated a longer period within which to \napprove the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, \nor institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the \nproposed rule change.\\5\\ On January 13, 2025, the Commission issued an \norder instituting proceedings under Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange \nAct \\6\\ to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule \nchange.\\7\\ On March 10, 2025, the Commission issued a notice of \ndesignation of a longer period of time for Commission action on \nproceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed \nrule change.\\8\\ On May 8, 2025, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to \nthe proposed rule change, which supersedes the original filing in its \nentirety.\\9\\ The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit \ncomments on the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, \nfrom interested persons and is approving the proposed rule change, as \nmodified by Amendment No. 1, on an accelerated basis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).\n    \\5\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101738, 89 FR 95283 \n(Dec. 2, 2024). The Commission designated January 14, 2025, as the \ndate by which the Commission shall approve or disapprove, or \ninstitute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the \nproposed rule change.\n    \\6\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).\n    \\7\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102168, 90 FR 6037 \n(Jan. 17, 2025).\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102560, 90 FR 12187 \n(Mar. 14, 2025). The Commission designated June 13, 2025, as the \ndate by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove the \nproposed rule change.\n    \\9\\ Amendment No. 1 is available on the Commission's website at \n<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nyse-2024-44/srnyse202444-599155-1740742.pdf\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nyse-2024-44/srnyse202444-599155-1740742.pdf</a>. In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange amended the proposed \nrule text to provide that: (i) the Exchange will disclose the amount \nof any unpaid fees as of the date of the non-compliance letter and \nthe Exchange will not review and approve a plan unless all such \ndisclosed fees are paid in full; (ii) at the beginning of each \ncalendar fiscal quarter (or semi-annual period in the case of a \nlisted non-U.S. company) during the plan period, the Exchange will \ndisclose to the company the amount of all unpaid fees owed by the \ncompany to the Exchange as of the end of the just-completed fiscal \nquarter or semi-annual period, as applicable, and that, if the \ncompany does not pay all of the disclosed outstanding fees within 45 \ndays, the Exchange will commence suspension and delisting \nprocedures; and (iii) a company will not be deemed back into \ncompliance prior to the completion of its plan period unless it has \npaid in full all of the disclosed outstanding fees and the Exchange \nwill initiate suspension and delisting procedures if the company has \nnot paid all of the disclosed outstanding fees as of the end of the \nplan period. In addition, in Amendment No. 1, the Exchange added \nfurther description to the proposal with respect to: (i) the work \nundertaken by the Exchange in reviewing compliance plans under \nSections 802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual; (ii) why the proposed \nrequirement is not being imposed on companies that are non-compliant \nwith the requirements of Sections 802.01E or 802.01F of the Manual; \nand (iii) the risk that companies that are delisted at the end of \nthe plan process may never pay outstanding fees owed to the \nExchange. See Amendment No. 1 at 4-5.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nII. Description of the Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment \nNo. 1\n\n    Currently, Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual provide that \nwhen the Exchange identifies a domestic company subject to Section \n802.02 of the Manual (``listed domestic company'') or a non-U.S. \ncompany subject to Section 802.03 of the Manual (``listed non-U.S. \ncompany'') as being below the continued listing criteria set forth in \nSection 802.01 of the Manual (and the company is not able to otherwise \nqualify under an original listing standard), the Exchange will notify \nthe company of such noncompliance by letter (the ``Non-Compliance \nLetter'') \\10\\ and give the company an opportunity to provide the \nExchange with a plan (``plan'') advising the Exchange of definitive \naction the company has taken, or is taking, that would bring it into \nconformity with continued listing standards within 18 months.\\11\\ If a \ncompany submits a plan pursuant to Sections 802.02 or 802.03 of the \nManual, it must identify specific quarterly milestones, in the case of \nlisted domestic companies, or semi-annual milestones, in the case of \nlisted non-U.S. companies, against which the Exchange will evaluate the \ncompany's progress.\\12\\ A company has 45 days, in the case of listed \ndomestic companies, or 90 days, in the case of listed non-U.S. \ncompanies, from receipt of the Non-Compliance Letter to submit its plan \nto the Exchange for review (the ``plan submission deadline'').\\13\\ \nOtherwise, the Exchange will promptly initiate suspension and delisting \nprocedures in accordance with Section 804.00 of the Manual.\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ The Exchange's proposal adds the defined term ``Non-\nCompliance Letter'' to the rule text. See Amendment No. 1 at 33, 35.\n    \\11\\ See Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual.\n    \\12\\ See id.\n    \\13\\ See id.\n    \\14\\ See id. The Exchange's proposal clarifies that such \nsuspension and delisting procedures are in accordance with Section \n804.00 of the Manual. See Amendment No. 1 at 5 n.5.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    With respect to a plan submitted pursuant to Sections 802.02 or \n802.03 of the Manual, Exchange staff will evaluate the plan, including \nany supporting documentation, and determine whether the company has \nmade a reasonable demonstration in the plan of the company's ability to \ncome into conformity with the relevant continued\n\n[[Page 22386]]\n\nlisting standards within 18 months.\\15\\ If the Exchange accepts the \nplan, the Exchange will review the company for compliance with the plan \neither quarterly, in the case of a listed domestic company, or semi-\nannually, in the case of a listed non-U.S. company.\\16\\ If the Exchange \ndetermines that the company has failed to meet the material aspects of \nthe plan or any quarterly or semi-annual milestones, as applicable, the \nExchange will review the circumstances and variance, and determine \nwhether the company remains able to come back into compliance or \nwhether such variance warrants commencement of suspension and delisting \nprocedures.\\17\\ In any event, a company that does not meet the \ncontinued listing standards at the end of the 18 months will be subject \nto the prompt initiation of suspension and delisting procedures in \naccordance with Section 804.00 of the Manual.\\18\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual. The Exchange \nwill make such determination within 45 days of receipt of the plan \nand will promptly notify the company of its determination in \nwriting. See id.\n    \\16\\ See id. The Exchange will deem the plan period over prior \nto the end of the 18 months if a company is able to demonstrate \nreturning to compliance with the applicable continued listing \nstandards, or achieving the ability to qualify under an original \nlisting standard, for a period of two consecutive quarters. See id.\n    \\17\\ See id. If the Exchange determines to proceed with \nsuspension and delisting procedures in accordance with Section \n804.00 of the Manual, it may do so regardless of the company's \ncontinued listing status at that time. See id.\n    \\18\\ See id. See also Amendment No. 1 at 6 n.6.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to amend Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the \nManual to provide that the Exchange will not review a plan submitted by \na listed domestic company or listed non-U.S. company (each referred to \nherein as a ``listed company'' and, together, ``listed companies'') \nthat the Exchange has identified as being below the continued listing \nstandards set forth in Section 802.01 of the Manual unless the company \nhas previously paid in full all listing or annual fees due to the \nExchange as of the date of the Non-Compliance Letter, as disclosed by \nthe Exchange in the Non-Compliance Letter.\\19\\ If the listed company is \nbelow the continued listing standards and has not paid in full all \noutstanding listing or annual fees disclosed in the Non-Compliance \nLetter by the plan submission deadline, the Exchange will promptly \ninitiate suspension and delisting procedures in accordance with Section \n804.00 of the Manual.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ See Amendment No. 1 at 7.\n    \\20\\ See id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In addition, the Exchange proposes to amend Sections 802.02 and \n802.03 of the Manual to provide that at the beginning of each quarterly \nor semi-annual period, as applicable, the Exchange will disclose to the \nlisted company in writing the amount of all unpaid listing and annual \nfees owed by the company to the Exchange as of the end of the just-\ncompleted fiscal period.\\21\\ If the company does not pay in full all of \nthe outstanding fees disclosed therein within 45 days of the date of \nsuch disclosure, the Exchange will promptly initiate suspension and \ndelisting procedures with respect to such company in accordance with \nSection 804.00 of the Manual.\\22\\ In addition, a company will not be \ndeemed to be back in compliance prior to the completion of its plan \nperiod unless it has paid in full all of the outstanding fees owed to \nthe Exchange as disclosed in the most recent quarterly or semi-annual \nfee disclosure, as applicable, and the Exchange will promptly initiate \nsuspension and delisting procedures in accordance with Section 804.00 \nof the Manual if a company has not paid in full all of the outstanding \nfees disclosed in the most recent disclosure as of the end of the plan \nperiod.\\23\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ See id.\n    \\22\\ See id.\n    \\23\\ See id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange states that the process of reviewing and analyzing \nplans, and reviewing the periodic updates with respect to plans, is \nresource-intensive and costly for the Exchange and requires significant \nwork by Exchange staff.\\24\\ The Exchange also states that, given the \nsignificant amount of work required to review and analyze plans, as \nwell as to undertake the required quarterly or semi-annual review of \nplans, the Exchange believes it is important to ensure that companies \nthat wish to have a plan accepted or continued by the Exchange have \npaid all outstanding annual and listing fees by the plan submission \ndeadline or at the time of any required review of such plan.\\25\\ The \nExchange further states that the large majority of companies that \nsubmit plans do so because they have fallen below compliance with the \nglobal market capitalization and stockholders' equity requirement of \nSection 802.01B of the Manual, which provides that a company will be \nconsidered below compliance if its average global market capitalization \nover a consecutive 30 trading-day period is less than $50,000,000 and, \nat the same time, stockholders' equity is less than $50,000,000.\\26\\ \nThe Exchange states that, in many cases, companies that are below \ncompliance with this requirement have limited liquidity and are often \ndelayed in paying their annual and listing fees.\\27\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ See Notice at 83528. According to the Exchange, in \nconnection with an initial plan review and each subsequent periodic \nupdate, the staff engages in a detailed review and analysis of the \ncompany's filed financial and other disclosures, as well as \nsupplemental documentation submitted by the company in support of \nthe plan or to evidence progress in successful implementation of the \nplan. According to the Exchange, the staff is required to become \ndeeply informed about the business and financial condition and the \nprospects of the company, including any material risks faced by the \ncompany. The Exchange states that, to achieve this level of \nunderstanding, Exchange staff typically engages in multiple detailed \nconversations with management in addition to the extensive \ndocumentary review that is undertaken and that this process requires \nsignificant expenditure of staff resources, including the \nsignificant involvement of senior staff members. See Amendment No. 1 \nat 6.\n    \\25\\ See Notice at 83528.\n    \\26\\ See Amendment No. 1 at 6-7. See also Section 802.01B of the \nManual.\n    \\27\\ See Amendment No. 1 at 7. The Exchange states that, in its \nexperience, when these companies fail to regain compliance under a \nplan and are subject to delisting, they have often not paid all \noutstanding fees at the time of delisting and, in many such cases, \nnever pay their outstanding fees. See id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange states that listed companies are already required by \nExchange rules to pay fees, as set forth in Section 902.00 et seq. of \nthe Manual \\28\\ and their listing agreements,\\29\\ and the Exchange \ncurrently has the authority under Section 802.01D of the Manual to \ndelist companies for violations of their agreements with the Exchange, \nincluding their listing agreements.\\30\\ The Exchange states that while \nthese provisions already give the Exchange authority to delist \ncompanies that do not pay their fees, the Exchange believes that it is \ndesirable to have a transparent and uniform process for the delisting \nof companies that are delinquent in paying their fees and seeking to \navail themselves of the plan process under Sections 802.02 or 802.03 of \nthe\n\n[[Page 22387]]\n\nManual.\\31\\ The Exchange also states that the proposal will help the \nExchange to ensure that it has sufficient resources to fund its \nregulatory activities related to the review and approval and the \nongoing monitoring of plans submitted by companies that are below \ncontinued listing standards.\\32\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ The listing fees and annual fees for all categories of \nlisted securities are set forth in Section 902.00 et seq. of the \nManual. See Notice at 83528 n.4.\n    \\29\\ The Exchange states that the NYSE listing agreement \nincludes an agreement by the listing applicant to ``pay when due all \nfees associated with its listing of securities on the Exchange, in \naccordance with the Exchange's rules.'' Notice at 83528. See also \nNYSE Listing Agreement for Domestic Company Equity Securities \navailable at: <a href=\"https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/listing/Domestic_Co_Listing_Agreement.pdf\">https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/listing/Domestic_Co_Listing_Agreement.pdf</a>.\n    \\30\\ See Notice at 83528. Section 802.01D of the Manual provides \nthat the Exchange may in its sole discretion subject a company to \nthe procedures outlined in Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual \nif the company, its transfer agent, or registrar, violates any of \nits, or their, listing or other agreements with the Exchange. In \naddition, Section 802.01D of the Manual provides that the Exchange \nis not limited by the criteria set forth in the rule and ``[o]ther \nfactors which may lead to a company's delisting include . . . [a] \nbreach by the company of the terms of its listing agreement.''\n    \\31\\ See Amendment No. 1 at 8.\n    \\32\\ See Notice at 83528.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIII. Discussion and Commission Findings\n\n    After careful review, the Commission finds that the proposed rule \nchange, as modified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with the \nrequirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations \nthereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.\\33\\ In \nparticular, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change, as \nmodified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the \nExchange Act,\\34\\ which requires, among other things, that the rules of \nan exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and \npractices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove \nimpediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and \na national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the \npublic interest, and not be designed to permit unfair discrimination \nbetween customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers; and Section 6(b)(7) of \nthe Exchange Act,\\35\\ which requires, among other things, that the \nrules of an exchange provide a fair procedure for the prohibition or \nlimitation by the exchange of any person with respect to access to \nservices offered by the exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\33\\ In approving this proposed rule change, the Commission has \nconsidered the proposed rule's impact on efficiency, competition, \nand capital formation.

Among other things, such listing standards help \nensure that exchange-listed companies will have sufficient public \nfloat, investor base, and trading interest to provide the depth and \nliquidity to promote fair and orderly markets.\\37\\ Meaningful listing \nstandards also are important given investor expectations regarding the \nnature of securities that have achieved an exchange listing, and the \nrole of an exchange in overseeing its market and assuring compliance \nwith its listing standards.\\38\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\36\\ The Commission notes that this reference to ``listing \nstandards'' is referring to both initial and continued listing \nstandards.\n    \\37\\ Adequate listing standards, by promoting fair and orderly \nmarkets, are consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, in \nthat they are, among other things, designed to prevent fraudulent \nand manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable \nprinciples of trade, and protect investors and the public interest. \nSee, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100816 (Aug. 26, \n2024), 89 FR 70674, 70677 n.47 (Aug. 30, 2024) (SR-NASDAQ-2024-019).\n    \\38\\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 101271 \n(Oct. 7, 2024), 89 FR 82652, 82653 n.23 and accompanying text (Oct. \n11, 2024) (SR-NASDAQ-2024-029) (Order Granting Approval of a \nProposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 2, to Modify the \nApplication of Bid Price Compliance Periods); 88716 (Apr. 21, 2020), \n85 FR 23393 (Apr. 27, 2020) (SR-NASDAQ-2020-001) (Order Approving a \nProposed Rule Change To Modify the Delisting Process for Securities \nWith a Bid Price at or Below $0.10 and for Securities That Have Had \nOne or More Reverse Stock Splits With a Cumulative Ratio of 250 \nShares or More to One Over the Prior Two-Year Period); 88389 (Mar. \n16, 2020), 85 FR 16163 (Mar. 20, 2020) (SR-NASDAQ-2019-089) (Notice \nof Filing of Amendment No. 1 and Order Granting Accelerated Approval \nof a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 1, To Amend \nRule 5815 To Preclude Stay During Hearing Panel Review of Staff \nDelisting Determinations in Certain Circumstances).

The Exchange will \ndisclose to these listed companies the amount of all unpaid listing and \nannual fees in the Non-Compliance Letter and at the beginning of the \nquarterly or semi-annual review period, as applicable. The Exchange \nalso proposes that it will commence suspension and delisting procedures \nif such companies fail to pay the disclosed fees in full within a \ncertain time period following such disclosure. The Exchange states that \nExchange staff must undertake a significant amount of resource-\nintensive and costly work in initially and periodically reviewing and \nanalyzing plans submitted by noncompliant companies pursuant to \nSections 802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual.\\41\\ The Commission finds that \nthe Exchange's proposal, as modified by Amendment No. 1, will further \nthe purposes of Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act by, among other \nthings, protecting investors and the public interest by helping to \nensure the Exchange has sufficient resources to fund its regulatory \nactivities relating to the review, approval, and ongoing monitoring of \nplans submitted by listed companies subject to Sections 802.02 and \n802.03 of the Manual and seeking to regain compliance with continued \nlisting standards.\\42\\ Moreover, although Sections 802.01D and 902.00 \nof the Manual provide the Exchange with existing authority to delist \ncompanies that fail to pay their listing or annual fees,\\43\\ the \nproposal will provide greater transparency to listed companies about \nhow the Exchange will handle unpaid fees in circumstances where \ncompanies seek to use or are using a compliance plan under Sections \n802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\41\\ See supra note 24 and accompanying text.\n    \\42\\ See supra note 32.\n    \\43\\ See supra notes 28-30 and accompanying text.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Commission finds that proposed rule change is also consistent \nwith the requirement of Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act \\44\\ that \nthe rules of a national securities exchange not be designed to permit \nunfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. \nIt is reasonable for the Exchange to limit its proposal to listed \ncompanies that are below continued listing standards and are subject to \nthe procedures in Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual. As \ndiscussed above, the Exchange states that many of the listed companies \nthat submit plans pursuant to Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual \ndo so because they have fallen below\n\n[[Page 22388]]\n\ncompliance with the global market capitalization and stockholders' \nequity requirement of Section 802.01B of the Manual. The Exchange \nstates that these companies often have limited liquidity and are \ndelayed in paying their annual and listing fees, and when they fail to \nregain compliance under the plan and are delisted, many times they \nnever pay their outstanding fees.\\45\\ Moreover, as discussed, above, \nthe Exchange states that the process of reviewing and analyzing plans \nand reviewing the periodic updates with respect to plans pursuant to \nSections 802.02 and 802.03 is resource-intensive and costly for the \nExchange.\\46\\ In addition, while Sections 802.01E and 802.01F of the \nManual also provide for compliance periods to allow listed companies to \ncome back into compliance with certain other Exchange rules, the \nExchange states that it does not, nor does it expect to, expend a \nsimilar amount of effort in reviewing and approving compliance plans \nunder these provisions.\\47\\ Accordingly, the proposal focuses on \ncompanies that are below listing standards and have unpaid fees \noutstanding in circumstances in which the Exchange can reasonably \nexpect to devote greater resources relating to the company coming back \ninto compliance with listing standards and where the Exchange faces a \ngreater risk of fees remaining unpaid.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\44\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\45\\ See supra notes 26-27 and accompanying text.\n    \\46\\ See supra note 24 and accompanying text.\n    \\47\\ See Amendment No. 1 at 7-9. In particular, Section 802.01E \n(SEC Annual and Quarterly Report Timely Filing Criteria) applies to \na listed company that incurs a late filing delinquency by failing to \ntimely file certain reports with the Commission and provides that \nsuch companies may be granted a compliance period of up to 12 months \nfrom the extended due date of the delayed filing. Section 802.01F of \nthe Manual (Noncompliance with Section 303A.14 (Erroneously Awarded \nCompensation)) applies to a listed issuer that is not compliant with \nthe ``clawback requirements'' relating to erroneously awarded \ncompensation and provides a process for an issuer to come back into \ncompliance with Exchange rules that is similar to the process set \nforth in Section 802.01E of the Manual. With respect to both rules, \nthe Exchange states that it does not expend a similar amount of \neffort in reviewing and approving compliance periods to that \nrequired in reviewing plans for quantitative non-compliance pursuant \nto Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual because the issues \ninvolved are generally narrower and more technical in nature and do \nnot require a review of a compliance plan that encompasses all of a \ncompany's business and financial condition. The Exchange also states \nthat, with respect to Section 802.01E, companies that are delayed in \nfiling their periodic reports are often in good financial health and \ndo not present significant risks of quantitative non-compliance or \nof being delisted without paying their outstanding fees. See id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Commission further believes the proposed rule change, as \nmodified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with Section 6(b)(7) of the \nExchange Act \\48\\ in that it provides a fair procedure for the \nprohibition or limitation by the Exchange of any person with respect to \naccess to services offered. A listed company whose securities are \nsubject to prompt suspension and delisting under the proposal will \nstill be able to seek review of a delisting determination from the \nCommittee for Review of the Board of Directors of the Exchange as set \nforth in Section 804.00 of the Manual. Further, the Exchange will \nprovide notice of unpaid fees by disclosing in writing the amount of \nall unpaid listing and annual fees owed by a company to the Exchange in \nthe Non-Compliance Letter and prior to any quarterly or semi-annual \nreview of a plan, and the company will then have a reasonable period of \ntime to pay such unpaid fees prior to the Exchange commencing \nsuspension and delisting procedures. Accordingly, the Exchange's \nprocess for review of a delisting determination will continue to \nprovide a fair procedure for the review of delisting determinations in \naccordance with Section 6(b)(7) of the Exchange Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\48\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(7).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that this \nproposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent \nwith the requirements of the Exchange Act.\\49\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\49\\ The comment letters received on the proposal were generally \nsupportive. See Letters from Melody Aina Maryann Brand, dated \nNovember 30, 2024; Elizabeth Slator, dated January 13, 2025.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV. Solicitation of Comments on Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule \nChange\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and \narguments concerning whether the proposed rule change, as modified by \nAmendment No. 1, is consistent with the Exchange Act. Comments may be \nsubmitted by any of the following methods:\n\nElectronic Comments\n\n    <bullet> Use the Commission's internet comment form (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml\">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml</a>); or\n    <bullet> Send an email to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f381869f96de909c9e9e969d8780b3809690dd949c85\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"b0c2c5dcd59dd3dfddddd5dec4c3f0c3d5d39ed7dfc6\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Please include \nfile number SR-NYSE-2024-44 on the subject line.\n\nPaper Comments\n\n    <bullet> Send paper comments in triplicate to Secretary, Securities \nand Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090.\n\nAll submissions should refer to file number SR-NYSE-2024-44. This file \nnumber should be included on the subject line if email is used. To help \nthe Commission process and review your comments more efficiently, \nplease use only one method. The Commission will post all comments on \nthe Commission's internet website (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml\">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml</a>). Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all \nwritten statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are \nfiled with the Commission, and all written communications relating to \nthe proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other \nthan those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the \nprovisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for website viewing and \nprinting in the Commission's Public Reference Room, 100 F Street NE, \nWashington, DC 20549, on official business days between the hours of 10 \na.m. and 3 p.m. Copies of the filing also will be available for \ninspection and copying at the principal office of the Exchange. Do not \ninclude personal identifiable information in submissions; you should \nsubmit only information that you wish to make available publicly. We \nmay redact in part or withhold entirely from publication submitted \nmaterial that is obscene or subject to copyright protection. All \nsubmissions should refer to file number SR-NYSE-2024-44, and should be \nsubmitted on or before June 17, 2025.\n\nV. Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by \nAmendment No. 1\n\n    The Commission finds good cause to approve the proposed rule \nchange, as modified by Amendment No. 1, prior to the thirtieth day \nafter the date of publication of notice of the filing of Amendment No. \n1 in the Federal Register. The changes in Amendment No. 1 provide \ngreater clarity to the rule text and additional explanation to the \nproposal. In particular, the changes in Amendment No. 1 provide that \nthe Exchange will disclose in writing the amount of all unpaid listing \nand annual fees owed by a company to the Exchange in the Non-Compliance \nLetter and prior to any quarterly or semi-annual review of a plan, and \nthat a company will have a specific period of time to pay such unpaid \nfees prior to the Exchange commencing suspension and delisting \nprocedures. These changes provide greater clarity to how the Exchange \nwill implement the proposal and help ensure that listed companies \nreceive adequate notice of the fees due to the Exchange prior to the \nExchange commencing suspension and delisting procedures. In addition, \nAmendment No. 1 further describes the work undertaken by the Exchange \nin\n\n[[Page 22389]]\n\nreviewing compliance plans under Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the \nManual and the risks relating to companies being delisted at the end of \nthe plan process without paying outstanding fees owed to the Exchange. \nThese changes help to explain why the proposed requirements are focused \non listed companies subject to Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the Manual \nand are not being imposed on other companies not subject to such \nprovisions. The changes to the rule text and additional information in \nAmendment No. 1 assist the Commission in evaluating the Exchange's \nproposal and in determining that it is consistent with the Exchange \nAct. Accordingly, the Commission finds good cause, pursuant to Section \n19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act,\\50\\ to approve the proposed rule change, \nas modified by Amendment No. 1, on an accelerated basis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\50\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\n    It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the \nExchange Act,\\51\\ that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-2024-44), as \nmodified by Amendment No. 1, be, and it hereby is, approved on an \naccelerated basis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\51\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).\n\n    For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, \npursuant to delegated authority.\\52\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\52\\ 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSherry R.

The Commission \nis publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule \nchange from interested persons.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange is filing a proposal to amend the MIAX Sapphire \nOptions Exchange Fee Schedule (the ``Fee Schedule'') relating to the \nOptions Regulatory Fee (``ORF'') to extend the current sunset date of \nMay 31, 2025 to December 31, 2025.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's \nwebsite at <a href=\"https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule-filings\">https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX Sapphire's principal office, and at the \nCommission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\n[[Page 22390]]\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its Fee Schedule related to the ORF \nto extend the current sunset date of May 31, 2025 to December 31, 2025, \nand thus continue charging the previously established ORF in the amount \nof $0.0013 per contract side through December 31, 2025. As discussed \nherein, the ORF sunset date of May 31, 2025 was initially proposed to \nprovide time for the Exchange to inform its approach to ORF and discuss \nalternative ORF models with market participants, so that it may compete \non equal footing with each of the other option exchanges that charge \nsimilar regulatory fees. However, those discussions have made clear \nthat there is not yet consensus among market participants on a path \nforward that would address industry concerns in a manner that would \neffect change broadly across all U.S. options exchanges. Thus, the \nExchange proposes to extend the automatic sunset date of May 31, 2025 \nuntil December 31, 2025 in order to provide it additional time to \ninform its approach to the ORF after the sunset date while continuing \nto fund a portion of its regulatory program via ORF so that it may \noperate on equal footing with each of the seventeen (17) other options \nexchanges that charge similar regulatory fees in amounts that far \nexceed the relatively modest amounts collected by the Exchange.\n    As background, on August 7, 2024 the Exchange initially filed this \nproposal to establish an ORF in the amount of $0.0013 per contract side \nthat would automatically sunset on October 31, 2024 (SR-SAPPHIRE-2024-\n14). The Exchange withdrew SR-SAPPHIRE-2024-14, and on August 21, 2024 \nreplaced it with SR-SAPPHIRE-2024-25 (the ``Initial ORF Filing'').\\3\\ \nThe Initial ORF Filing was published for comment in the Federal \nRegister on September 3, 2024.\\4\\ On October 31, 2024, the Exchange \nfiled to extend the Initial ORF Filing sunset date of October 31, 2024 \nto May 31, 2025.\\5\\ To date, the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(the ``Commission'') received no comments on the Initial ORF Filing or \nits subsequent extension.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100824 (August 27, \n2024), 89 FR 71496 (September 3, 2024) (SR-SAPPHIRE-2024-25).\n    \\4\\ See Supra note 3.\n    \\5\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101589 (October 31, \n2024) [sic], 89 FR 90787 (November 18, 2024) (SR-SAPPHIRE-2024-35).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The ORF is designed to recover a material portion of the costs to \nthe Exchange of the supervision and regulation of Members' \\6\\ customer \noptions business, including performing routine surveillances and \ninvestigations, as well as policy, rulemaking, interpretive and \nenforcement activities. The Exchange believes that revenue generated \nfrom the ORF, when combined with all of the Exchange's other regulatory \nfees and fines, will cover a material portion, but not all, of the \nExchange's regulatory costs. Currently, all other registered options \nexchanges impose ORF on their members, and those exchanges also charge \nORF for executions occurring on the Exchange cleared by their \ncustomers.\\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization that \nis registered with the Exchange pursuant to Chapter II of MIAX \nSapphire Rules for purposes of trading on the Exchange as an \n``Electronic Exchange Member'' or ``Market Maker.''

The Commission also noted \nthat the filings provided only broad general statements regarding \noptions transaction volume and did not provide any information on those \nexchanges' historic or projected options regulatory costs (including \nthe costs of regulating activity that cleared in the ``customer'' range \nand the costs of regulating activity that occurred off exchange), the \namount of regulatory revenue they had generated and expected to \ngenerate from the ORF as\n\n[[Page 22391]]\n\nwell as other sources, or the ``material portion'' of options \nregulatory expenses that they sought to recover from the ORF. Each of \nthose exchanges withdrew their filings, but continue charging ORF today \nas discussed above. The Exchange would be at an unfair competitive \ndisadvantage if it were not allowed to charge the ORF to recover a \nmaterial portion, but not all, of the Exchange's regulatory costs for \nthe supervision and regulation of activity of its Members which as \nnoted above, is charged by all currently operating options exchanges.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 87168 (September 30, \n2019), 84 FR 53210 (October 4, 2019) (SR-Emerald-2019-29); \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 87167 (September 30, 2019), 84 \nFR 53189 (October 4, 2019) (SR-PEARL-2019-23); Securities Exchange \nAct Release No. 87169 (September 30, 2019), 84 FR 53195 (October 4, \n2019) (SR-MIAX-2019-35); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 87170 \n(September 30, 2019), 84 FR 53213 (October 4, 2019) (SRCBOE-2019-\n040); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 87172 (September 30, 2019) \n84 FR 53192 (October 4, 2019) (SR-CboeEDGX-2019-051); Securities \nExchange Act Release No 87171 (September 30, 2019), 84 FR 53200 \n(October 4, 2019) (SR-C2-2019-018); Securities Exchange Act Release \nNo. 86832 (August 30, 2019), 84 FR 46980 (September 6, 2019) (SR-\nNYSEArca-2019-49); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 86833 (August \n30, 2019) 84 FR 47029 (September 6, 2019) (SR-NYSEAMER-2019-27).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange recognizes that an alternative model is being pursued \namong industry participants but that a consensus has not yet been \nreached. As such, the Exchange proposes additional time to work towards \na permanent ORF solution by gathering relevant data internally as well \nfrom other industry participants, while continuing to charge as other \noptions exchanges currently do, until December 31, 2025, at which time \nits ORF will automatically sunset.\n    The Exchange notes that if, during the proposed sunset period of \nMay 31, 2025 through December 31, 2025, a viable alternative \nmethodology for the ORF presents itself, the Exchange would endeavor to \nimplement said alternative prior to the proposed sunset date. In other \nwords, the existence of the sunset date of December 31, 2025 to the \nExchange's current ORF would not preclude it from filing to modify its \nORF methodology prior to that date, if applicable.\n    As a new exchange, not having the opportunity to fund its \nregulatory program through the same regulatory fee charged by every \nother options exchange would place an undue competitive disadvantage \nupon the Exchange's regulatory program and options business as a whole. \nFurther, the Exchange emphasizes that other exchanges will be charging \nORF for transactions occurring on MIAX Sapphire, and as such, it \nfollows that the exchange that is primarily responsible for monitoring \nthose transactions should also be able to charge the ORF for activity \noccurring on its own market, as well as transactions it surveils on \naway markets. Again, the Exchange is committed to facilitating and \njoining efforts to revamp the ORF, however, it must be afforded \nadditional time to do so while recouping a portion of its regulatory \ncosts via the ORF as all other options exchanges do.\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that its proposal to amend its Fee Schedule \nis consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act \\9\\ in general, and furthers \nthe objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act \\10\\ in particular, in \nthat it is an equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other \ncharges among its members and issuers and other persons using its \nfacilities. The Exchange also believes the proposal furthers the \nobjectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act \\11\\ in that it is designed to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments \nto and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national \nmarket system, and, in general to protect investors and the public \ninterest and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between \ncustomers, issuers, brokers and dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n    \\11\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The ORF is designed to recover a material portion of the costs of \nsupervising and regulating Members' customer options business including \nperforming routine surveillances and investigations, as well as policy, \nrulemaking, interpretive, and enforcement activities. Extending the \ncurrent ORF sunset date to December 31, 2025 is reasonable because \ncontinued collection of ORF will serve to balance the Exchange's \nregulatory revenue against the anticipated regulatory costs, thereby \nensuring proper regulatory funding. Moreover, the Exchange's ORF rate \nis lower than the amount of ORF assessed on other exchanges.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See, e.g., NYSE Arca Options Fees and Charges, ORF and NYSE \nAmerican Options Fees Schedule, Section VII(A), which provide that \nORF is assessed at a rate of $0.0055 per contract for each \nrespective exchange. See also Nasdaq PHLX, Options 7 Pricing \nSchedule, Section 6(D), which provides for an ORF rate of $0.0034 \nper contract; Cboe Options Fee Schedule, which provides an ORF rate \nof $0.0017 per contract; Nasdaq Options Market, Options 7 Pricing \nSchedule, Section 5, which provides an ORF rate of $0.0016 per \ncontract; BOX Options Fee Schedule Section II(C), which provides an \nORF rate of $0.00295 per contract; MIAX Options Fee Schedule, \nSection 2(b), which provides an ORF rate of $0.0019 per contract; \nMIAX Pearl Fee Schedule, Section 2(b), which provides an ORF rate of \n$0.0018 per contract; and the MEMX Fee Schedule which provides an \nORF rate of $0.0015.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Extending the sunset date is also reasonable because doing so would \nallow the Exchange additional time to inform its approach to ORF moving \nforward while recouping a portion of its regulatory expenses via the \nORF as other options exchanges do. If the Exchange were not allowed to \ncharge an ORF during this additional time period, then after the sunset \ndate of May 31, 2025, it would be forced to pay for its regulatory \nprogram solely out of business revenues while working towards an \nalternative ORF solution, unlike every other competing exchange, each \nof which would continue to assess an ORF, including on transactions \nexecuted on the Exchange, indefinitely. This would impact the \nExchange's ability to assure adequate funding of its regulatory \nprogram.\n    Extending the ORF sunset date to December 31, 2025 is also \nequitable and not unfairly discriminatory because prior to the proposed \nsunset date, the ORF would continue to be objectively allocated to \nMembers in a manner that is consistent with the ORF imposed by the \nother seventeen (17) options exchanges. The Exchange will continue to \nmonitor the amount of revenue collected from the ORF to ensure that it, \nin combination with its other regulatory fees and fines, does not \nexceed the Exchange's total regulatory costs.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    MIAX Sapphire does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act. This proposal will not create \nan unnecessary or inappropriate intra-market burden on competition \nbecause the ORF will apply to all customer activity, and is designed to \nenable the Exchange to recover a material portion of the Exchange's \ncost related to its regulatory activities. This proposal will not \ncreate an unnecessary or inappropriate inter-market burden on \ncompetition because it will be a regulatory fee that supports \nregulation in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange is \nobligated to ensure that the amount of regulatory revenue collected \nfrom the ORF, in combination with its other regulatory fees and fines, \ndoes not exceed regulatory costs. MIAX Sapphire's ORF, is lower than, \nor comparable to, fees charged by other options exchanges for the same \nor similar services.\n    The Exchange notes that while it does not believe that its proposed \nORF will impose any burden on inter-market competition, the Exchange \nnot charging an ORF or being precluded from charging an ORF after May \n31, 2025 but prior to the proposed sunset date of December 31, 2025 \nwould, in-fact, represent a significant burden on the Exchange's \nability to assure adequate funding of its regulatory program. As noted \nabove, the Exchange is a new entrant in the highly competitive \nenvironment for equity options trading. Also, as noted above, all \nregistered options exchanges currently impose the ORF on their members, \nand such ORF fees imposed by other options\n\n[[Page 22392]]\n\nexchanges currently do and will continue to extend to executions \noccurring on the Exchange. The Exchange believes that it is likely that \na viable ORF alternative may be presented during the proposed sunset \nperiod. The Exchange believes that in order to compete with these \nexisting options exchanges, it must, in fact, impose an ORF on its \nMembers during this additional sunset period, and that the inability to \ndo so would result in an unfair competitive disadvantage to the \nExchange.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\13\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\14\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit \ncomments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange is filing a proposal to amend the MIAX Options \nExchange Fee Schedule (the ``Fee Schedule'') to amend the MIAX Options \nExchange Fee Schedule (the ``Fee Schedule'') to, among other things, \nadopt new fee categories for the Exchange's proprietary market data \nfeeds: (1) the Top of Market (``ToM'') feed, (2) the Complex Top of \nMarket feed (``cToM''), (3) the Administrative Information Subscriber \nfeed (``AIS''), and (4) the MIAX Order Feed (``MOR'') (collectively, \nthe ``market data feeds'').\n    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's \nwebsite at <a href=\"https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule-filings\">https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX's principal office, and at the \nCommission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange offers four standard proprietary market data products, \nToM, cToM, AIS, and MOR. The ToM data feed is a data feed that contains \nthe Exchange's best bid and offer, with\n\n[[Page 22393]]\n\naggregate size, and last sale information, based on order and quoting \ninterest on the Exchange.\\3\\ The ToM data feed includes data that is \nidentical to the data sent to the processor for the Options Price \nReporting Authority (``OPRA''). The data for ToM and OPRA leave the \nSystem \\4\\ at the same time, as required under Section 5.2(c)(iii)(B) \nof the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Options Price \nReporting Authority LLC (the ``OPRA Plan''), which prohibits the \ndissemination of proprietary information on any more timely basis than \nthe same information is furnished to the OPRA system for inclusion in \nOPRA's consolidated dissemination of options information. The cToM data \nfeed includes the same types of information as ToM, but for Complex \nOrders \\5\\ on the Exchange's Strategy Book.\\6\\ This information \nincludes the Exchange's best bid and offer for a complex strategy \\7\\, \nwith aggregate size, based on displayable orders in the complex \nstrategy. The cToM data feed also provides subscribers with the \nfollowing information: (i) the identification of the complex strategies \ncurrently trading on the Exchange; (ii) complex strategy last sale \ninformation; and (iii) the status of securities underlying the complex \nstrategy (e.g., halted, open, or resumed). The AIS data feed provides \nsubscribers real-time updates regarding products traded on MIAX, \ntrading status for MIAX and products traded on MIAX, and liquidity \nseeking event notifications (``administrative information'').\\8\\ The \nMOR data feed includes full order book data for orders on the Simple \nOrder Book \\9\\ and Strategy Book, and includes the following data: \nproduct ID, order price, order original volume, remaining volume open, \nand origin code.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 69007 (February 28, \n2013), 78 FR 14617 (March 6, 2013) (SR-MIAX-2013-05) (Notice of \nFiling and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To \nEstablish the MIAX Top of Market (``ToM'') Data Product).\n    \\4\\ The term ``System'' means the automated trading system used \nby the Exchange for the trading of securities.

The Exchange \namended the MOR data feed in 2016 in connection with the launch of \ncomplex orders on the Exchange, in order to include such complex \norders in MOR. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 79146 \n(October 24, 2016), 81 FR 75171(October 28, 2016) (SR-MIAX-2016-36).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 6 of the Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees, provides fees for \nthe ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feeds. Currently, the Exchange only \ncharges monthly fees to both Internal and External Distributors \n(proposed definitions below) of the ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feeds. \nSpecifically, the Exchange charges Internal Distributors a monthly fee \nof $2,000.00 for the ToM and cToM data feeds, $1,250.00 for the AIS \ndata feed, and $3,000.00 for the MOR data feed. The Exchange also \ncharges External Distributors a monthly fee of $3,000.00 for the ToM \nand cToM data feeds, $1,750.00 for the AIS data feed, and $3,500.00 for \nthe MOR data feed.\n    The Exchange now proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to, among other \nthings, adopt new fee categories for the Exchange's proprietary market \ndata feeds. The primary purpose of this proposal is to adopt per User \n(defined below) fees as well as fees for Non-Display Usage (also \ndefined below). The Exchange also proposes to add a ``Market Data \nDefinitions'' section to Section 6 of the Fee Schedule as well as \nmodify how mid-month subscriptions for Distributors are to be handled. \nThe Exchange believes that adopting the same fee structure as its \naffiliated exchanges would reduce administrative burdens on market data \nsubscribers that also currently subscribe to market data feeds from the \nExchange's affiliates. Each of these proposed changes are described \nbelow.\n* * * * *\n    The Exchange believes that exchanges, in setting fees of all types, \nshould meet very high standards of transparency to demonstrate why each \nnew fee or fee increase meets the requirements of the Act that fees be \nreasonable, equitably allocated, not unfairly discriminatory, and not \ncreate an undue burden on competition among Members \\11\\ and markets. \nThe Exchange believes this high standard is especially important when \nan exchange imposes various fees for market participants to access an \nexchange's market data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization \napproved to exercise the trading rights associated with a Trading \nPermit. Members are deemed ``members'' under the Exchange Act. See \nExchange Rule 100.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Approximately 60% of Members subscribe to one or more market data \nfeeds from the Exchange. Of those Members, approximately 37% subscribe \nto all four market data feeds, approximately 22% subscribe to three \nmarket data feeds, approximately 19% subscribe to two market data \nfeeds, and approximately 22% subscribe to only one market data feed. \nThe Exchange notes that there is no requirement that any Member or \nmarket participant subscribe to the ToM, cToM, AIS or MOR data feeds \noffered by the Exchange. Instead, a Member may choose to maintain \nsubscriptions to the ToM, cToM, AIS or MOR data feeds based on their \nown business needs and trading models.\nDefinitions\n    The Exchange proposes to include a Definitions section at the \nbeginning of Section 6, Market Data Fees, of the Fee Schedule. The \npurpose of the Definitions section is to provide market participants \ngreater clarity and transparency regarding the applicability of fees by \ndefining certain terms used in connection with market data feeds within \nthe Fee Schedule in a single location related to the Exchange's market \ndata products. The Exchange notes that it includes similar Definitions \nin its fee schedule applicable to its own equity trading platform, MIAX \nPearl Equities,\\12\\ and that each of the proposed definitions are based \non the MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule and that of other exchanges. \nThe Exchange believes that including a Definitions section for market \ndata products makes the Fee Schedule more user-friendly and \ncomprehensive.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Fees, and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 (June 12, \n2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).

Any entity that receives the Exchange data \nproduct directly from the Exchange or indirectly through another entity \nand then distributes it internally or externally to a third party.\n    <bullet> External Distributor. A Distributor that receives the \nExchange data product and then distributes that data to a third party \nor one or more Users outside the Distributor's own entity.\n    <bullet> Internal Distributor. A Distributor that receives the \nExchange data product and then distributes that data to one or more \nUsers within the Distributor's own entity.\n    [cir] The Exchange notes that it proposes to use the phrase ``own \nentity'' in the definition of Internal Distributor and External \nDistributor because a Distributor would be permitted to share data \nreceived from an exchange data product to other legal entities \naffiliated with the Distributor's entity that have been disclosed to \nthe Exchange without such distribution being considered external to a \nthird party. For instance, if a company has multiple affiliated broker-\ndealers under the same holding company, that company could have one of \nthe broker-dealers or a non-broker-dealer affiliate subscribe to an \nexchange data product and then share the data with other affiliates \nthat have a need for the data. This sharing with affiliates would not \nbe considered external distribution to a third party but instead would \nbe considered internal distribution to data recipients within the \nDistributor's own entity.\n    [cir] The Exchange also notes that the explanatory paragraphs under \nthe ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feed fee tables includes the following \nlanguage which defines the terms Distributor, Internal Distributors, \nand External Distributors:\n    MIAX will assess Market Data Fees applicable to ToM [cToM, AIS or \nMOR] on Internal and External Distributors in each month the \nDistributor is credentialed to use ToM [cToM, AIS or MOR] in the \nproduction environment. A Distributor of MIAX data is any entity that \nreceives a feed or file of data either directly from MIAX or indirectly \nthrough another entity and then distributes it either internally \n(within that entity) or externally (outside that entity). All \nDistributors are required to execute a MIAX Distributor Agreement.\n    The Exchange proposes to remove these provisions from the Fee \nSchedule because they: (i) duplicate the proposed definitions of \nDistributor, External Distributor, and External Distributor proposed \nherein with no substantive difference; and (ii) provide details that \nare included in the Exchange's market data policies that are also not \nalso provided for in the fee schedules of other options exchanges.\\13\\ \nRemoving these provisions would also harmonize the definition and fee \ndescriptions with the fee schedule applicable to MIAX Pearl \nEquities.\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options, Market Data Fees section, both available \nathttps://<a href=\"http://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/?_gl=1*19q7zz0*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjY5OTA0NzE4LjE3MzQ1MzQzODk.*_ga_5Q99WB9X71*MTczNDUzNzQ0Mi4yLjEuMTczNDUzNzQ5OC4wLjAuMA\">www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/?_gl=1*19q7zz0*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjY5OTA0NzE4LjE3MzQ1MzQzODk.*_ga_5Q99WB9X71*MTczNDUzNzQ0Mi4yLjEuMTczNDUzNzQ5OC4wLjAuMA</a>.

Any method of accessing an Exchange \ndata product that involves access or use by a machine or automated \ndevice without access or use of a display by a natural person or \npersons.\n    <bullet> Non-Professional User. A natural person or qualifying \ntrust that uses Exchange data only for personal purposes and not for \nany commercial purpose and, for a natural person who works in the \nUnited States, is not: (i) registered or qualified in any capacity with \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading \nCommission, any state securities agency, any securities exchange or \nassociation, or any commodities or futures contract market or \nassociation; (ii) engaged as an ``investment adviser'' as that term is \ndefined in Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 \n(whether or not registered or qualified under that Act); or (iii) \nemployed by a bank or other organization exempt from registration under \nfederal or state securities laws to perform functions that would \nrequire registration or qualification if such functions were performed \nfor an organization not so exempt; or, for a natural person who works \noutside of the United States, does not perform the same functions as \nwould disqualify such person as a Non-Professional User if he or she \nworked in the United States.\n    <bullet> Professional User. Any User other than a Non-Professional \nUser.\n    <bullet> User. A Professional User or Non-Professional User.\nProposed Market Data Pricing\n    As described above, the Exchange currently only charges Internal \nDistributors a monthly fee of $2,000.00 for the ToM and cToM data \nfeeds, $1,250.00 for the AIS data feed, and $3,000.00 for the MOR data \nfeed. The Exchange also only currently charges External Distributors a \nmonthly fee of $3,000.00 for the ToM and cToM data feeds, $1,750.00 for \nthe AIS data feed, and $3,500.00 for the MOR data feed. The Exchange \nnow proposes to charge the below per User fees as well as Non-Display \nUsage fees for the ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feeds, which, the \nExchange believes are generally similar to or lower than market data \nfees charged by other similarly situated options exchanges. The \nExchange does not propose to adopt any additional fee categories in \nthis proposal. Each of the below capitalized terms are defined above \nand would be included under the proposed Definitions section under \nSection 6, Market Data Fees, of the Fee Schedule.\n    1. User Fees. For the ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feeds, the \nExchange proposes to charge a monthly fee of $20.00 for each \nProfessional User and $1.00 for each Non-Professional User of each data \nfeed.\\15\\ The proposed User fees would apply to each person that has \naccess to the ToM, cToM, AIS or MOR data feeds that is provided by a \nDistributor (either Internal or External) for displayed usage. Each \nDistributor's User count would include every individual that has access \nto the data regardless of the purpose for which the individual uses the \ndata. The above Professional or Non-Professional User fee would provide \nthe same Professional or Non-Professional User access to all other MIAX \nMarket Data feeds for no additional per User charge.\\16\\ In other \nwords, a User would receive access to the ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data \nfeeds for the applicable single per User fee and not have to pay \nseparate per User fees for each data feed. As such, Distributors should \nreport the number of Users per the Exchange, and not per individual \ndata feed. This would be noted in Section 6 of the Fee Schedule under \nfootnote 1 following the fee tables for the ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data \nfeeds. Distributors of the ToM, cToM, AIS or MOR data feeds would be \nrequired to report all Professional and Non-Professional Users in \naccordance with the following:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ The Exchange does not propose to adopt an Enterprise Fee at \nthis time and may do so in the future based on feedback from market \nparticipants.\n    \\16\\ The Exchange notes that similar reporting is required by \nthe Nasdaq options markets, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq \nOptions''), Nasdaq Phlx LLC (``Nasdaq Phlx''), and Nasdaq MRX, LLC \n(``Nasdaq MRX''). See, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions\">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions</a> (providing that ``[t]he monthly \nuser fee should be reported once for Nasdaq Options, not once per \ndatafeed'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> In connection with a Distributor's distribution of the \nToM, cToM, AIS or MOR data feeds, the Distributor must count as one \nUser each unique User that\n\n[[Page 22395]]\n\nthe Distributor is entitled for access to the ToM, cToM, AIS or MOR \ndata feeds.\n    <bullet> Distributors must report each unique individual person who \nreceives access through multiple devices or multiple methods (e.g., a \nsingle User has multiple passwords and user identifications) as one \nUser.\n    <bullet> If a Distributor entitles one or more individuals to use \nthe same device, the Distributor must include only the individuals, and \nnot the device, in the count. Thus, Distributors would not be required \nto report User device counts associated with a User's display use of \nthe data feed.\n    2. Non-Display Usage Fees. The Exchange proposes to establish a \nmonthly Non-Display Usage \\17\\ fee of $1,500.00 for the ToM, cToM, AIS \nand MOR data feeds.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Non-Display Usage would include trading uses such as high \nfrequency or algorithmic trading as well as any trading in any asset \nclass, automated order or quote generation and/or order pegging, \nprice referencing for smart order routing, operations control \nprograms, investment analysis, order verification, surveillance \nprograms, risk management, compliance, and portfolio management.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> The Exchange proposes to provide a discount to those that \nsubscribe to two or more MIAX data feeds by capping the Non-Display \nUsage fee for Subscribers of two or more MIAX data feeds at $3,000.00. \nThis would be noted in Section 6 of the Fee Schedule under footnote 2 \nfollowing the fee tables for the ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feeds.\n    Lastly, the Exchange proposes to no longer pro-rate fees for \nDistributors who subscribe or terminate mid-month. The Exchange notes \nthat there were no mid-month subscriptions or terminations over the \npast twelve (12) months that would have required the monthly fee to be \npro-rated. The Exchange also notes that mid-month subscriptions and \nterminations place an increased burden on Exchange staff and systems \nthat are in place to pro-rate the monthly fee that are not justified by \nthe little to no mid-month subscriptions and terminations that occurred \nover the past year or that the Exchange anticipates going forward based \non its past experience. This portion of the proposal should also \nencourage subscribers to either begin a new subscription or terminate \nan existing subscription at the beginning or end of a month, \nrespectively. Lastly, removing these provisions would also harmonize \nthe MIAX Fee Schedule with the MIAX Pearl Equities fee schedule, which \nalso does not provide for pro-ration.\\18\\ Also, other exchanges do not \nprovide for the similar pro-ration of market data fees.\\19\\ Therefore, \nthe Exchange proposes to remove the following language providing for \npro-rated month fees for mid-month subscribers from the explanatory \nparagraphs under the ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feed fee tables:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Fees, and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 (June 12, \n2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n    \\19\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule and Cboe EDGX Options Fee \nSchedule, supra note 13. See also MEMX Options Fee Schedule and \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 101370 (October 17, 2024), 89 FR \n84638 (October 23, 2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Market Data Fees for [ToM/cToM/AIS/MOR] will be reduced for new \nDistributors for the first month during which they subscribe to [ToM/\ncToM/AIS/MOR], based on the number of trading days that have been held \nduring the month prior to the date on which they have been credentialed \nto use [ToM/cToM/AIS/MOR] in the production environment. Such new \nDistributors will be assessed a pro-rata percentage of the fees \ndescribed above, which is the percentage of the number of trading days \nremaining in the affected calendar month as of the date on which they \nhave been credentialed to use [ToM/cToM/AIS/MOR] in the production \nenvironment, divided by the total number of trading days in the \naffected calendar month.\nImplementation\n    The Exchange issued alerts publicly announcing the proposed fees on \nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 17, 2024.\\20\\ The fees subject to this \nproposal are immediately effective.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ See Fee Change Alert, MIAX Exchange Group--January 1, 2025 \nand March 1, 2025 Market Data Fee Changes (dated September 30, \n2024), available at <a href=\"https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/09/30/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2025-market-1?nav=all\">https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/09/30/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2025-market-1?nav=all</a> and Fee Change Alert, MIAX Exchange Group--Options \nMarkets--Reminder: January 1, 2025 and March 1, 2025 Market Data Fee \nChanges (dated December 17, 2024), available at <a href=\"https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/12/17/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-reminder-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2?nav=all\">https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/12/17/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-reminder-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2?nav=all</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent \nwith the provisions of Section 6(b) \\21\\ of the Act in general, and \nfurthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) \\22\\ of the Act, in \nparticular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable \nallocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its Members \nand other persons using its facilities. Additionally, the Exchange \nbelieves that the proposed fees are consistent with the objectives of \nSection 6(b)(5) \\23\\ of the Act in that they are designed to promote \njust and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and \ncoordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, \nprocessing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions \nin securities, to remove impediments to a free and open market and \nnational market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the \npublic interest, and, particularly, are not designed to permit unfair \ndiscrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f.\n    \\22\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n    \\23\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes that the ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feeds are \nentirely optional. The Exchange is not required to make the ToM, cToM, \nAIS and MOR data feeds available to any customers, nor is any customer \nrequired to purchase the ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feeds.\nThe Proposed Fees Are Reasonable and Comparable to the Fees Charged by \nOther Exchanges for Similar Data Products\n    Overall. The proposed fees are comparable to those of other options \nexchanges. Based on publicly-available information, no single exchange \nhad more than 13.65% equity options market share for all of 2024,\\24\\ \nand the Exchange compared the fees proposed herein to the fees charged \nby other options exchanges with similar market share. A more detailed \ndiscussion of the comparison follows.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ See The OCC, Options Volume by Exchange--2024, available at \n<a href=\"https://www.theocc.com/market-data/market-data-reports/volume-and-open-interest/volume-by-exchange\">https://www.theocc.com/market-data/market-data-reports/volume-and-open-interest/volume-by-exchange</a> (last visited May 5, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange assesses the market share for each of the below \nreferenced options markets utilizing total equity options contracts \ntraded in 2024, as set forth in the following charts: \\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ Market share is the percentage of volume on a particular \nexchange relative to the total volume across all exchanges, and \nindicates the amount of order flow directed to that exchange. High \nlevels of market share enhance the value of trading and ports. Total \ncontracts include both multi-list options and proprietary options \nproducts. Proprietary options products are products with \nintellectual property rights that are not multi-listed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Fees\n    The proposed per User fees for the Exchange's market data products \nare comparable to or lower than those charged by Nasdaq Options, Nasdaq \nMRX, Cboe BZX Options, and Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc.

Nasdaq Options, with a market share of \napproximately 5.45% that is comparable to the Exchange, charges higher \nor comparable Professional and Non-Professional User fees for its top \nof book and depth of book feeds than proposed by the Exchange. Further, \nlike Nasdaq Options, the Exchange proposes to charge a single per User \nfee that would provide access to all of its market data products for a \nsingle fee.\n    The Nasdaq Options Best of Nasdaq Options (``BONO'') feed is an \noptions feed that provides Nasdaq Options' best bid and offer and last \nsale information.\\26\\ The Nasdaq Options BONO feed is similar to the \nExchange's ToM data feed. The Nasdaq Options ITCH to Trade Options \n(``ITTO'') feed is an options feed that provides full order and quote \ndepth information for individual orders and quotes and last sale \ninformation.\\27\\ ITTO also provides, among other things, product \n(option series) available for trading on Nasdaq Options, the trading \nstatus of such products (i.e., whether the series is available for \nclosing transactions only), and order imbalances on opening/reopenings. \nThe ITTO feed is similar to the Exchange's MOR and AIS data feeds.\\28\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\26\\ See Nasdaq Options Rules, Options 3, Section 23(a)(2).\n    \\27\\ See Nasdaq Options Rules, Options 3, Section 23(a)(1).\n    \\28\\ The Exchange notes that no other exchange offers a market \ndata feed that provides the same scope of information as the AIS \nfeed. However, other exchanges, such as Nasdaq Options via the ITTO \nfeed, include similar information as the AIS feed. The Exchange \nnotes that some, but not all, of the messages included in the AIS \nfeed overlap with the Exchange's other data feeds. However, not all \nof the Exchange's market data subscribers separately purchase the \nAIS feed. In any event, subscribers would not necessarily pay more \nfor the AIS feed because the Exchange proposes to charge a single \nper User fee to receive all of the Exchange's data feeds. Likewise, \nNasdaq Options also charges a single per exchange User fee for which \ntheir subscribers may receive similar data as the AIS feed via \nmultiple market data feeds for a single per User price. The Exchange \nis also not comparing its cToM feed to a comparable Nasdaq Options \nfeed because the Exchange understands Nasdaq Options does not offer \nsuch a feed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Nasdaq Options charges Professional Users $42.10 per month and Non-\nProfessional Users $1.00 per month for the BONO feed and ITTO feed.\\29\\ \nThe Exchange proposes to charge less than Nasdaq Options for \nProfessional Users and the same as Nasdaq Options for Non-Professional \nUsers while also providing access to all of its market data feeds for a \nsingle per User fee. Specifically, for both the ToM and MOR data feeds, \nthe Exchange proposes to charge Professional Users $20.00 per month and \nNon-Professional Users $1.00 per month. The Exchange's proposed \nProfessional User fee is lower than Nasdaq Options and its Non-\nProfessional User fee is equal to Nasdaq Options. Despite having \nincrementally lower market share than the Exchange, Nasdaq Options \ncharges higher or comparable per User fees than proposed by the \nExchange herein.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ See Price List--U.S. Derivatives Data, available at <a href=\"https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions\">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions</a>.

Nasdaq MRX, with a market share of approximately 2.71%, \nlower than the Exchange, charges higher Professional and Non-\nProfessional User fees for its top of book and depth of book feeds than \nthe fees proposed by the Exchange.

Specifically, for the ToM, cToM, and MOR data \nfeeds, the Exchange proposes to charge Professional Users $20.00 per \nmonth and Non-Professional Users $1.00 per month. The Exchange's \nproposed Professional User fee is lower than Nasdaq MRX and its Non-\nProfessional User fee is equal to Nasdaq MRX.

Cboe BZX Options, with a market share of \napproximately 3.99%, which is lower than the Exchange's market share, \ncharges higher Professional and Non-Professional User fees for its \ndepth of book feed than the fees proposed by the Exchange. Further, \nCboe BZX Options also charges separate per User fees per data product, \nwhereas the Exchange proposes to charge a single lower per User fee \nthat would provide access to all of its market data products for a \nsingle fee.\n    The Cboe BZX Options Top feed is an options feed that provides top \nof book\n\n[[Page 22397]]\n\nquotations and execution information. The Cboe BZX Options Top feed is \nsimilar to the Exchange's ToM feed.\\35\\ The Cboe BZX Options Depth feed \nis an options feed that provides depth of book quotations and execution \ninformation. The Cboe BZX Options Depth feed is similar to the \nExchange's MOR data feed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\35\\ For the Cboe BZX Options Top Feed, Cboe BZX Option charges \nProfessional Users $5.00 per month and Non-Professional Users $0.10 \nper month. For ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feeds, the Exchange \nproposes to charge Professional Users $20.00 per month and Non-\nProfessional Users $1.00 per month. Although higher, the Exchange's \nproposed Professional and Non-Professional User fees are not \nnecessarily comparable to Cboe BZX Options Top fees because a User \nmay receive access to each of the Exchange's four data feeds for a \nsingle per User fee and, unlike Cboe BZX Options, not be required to \npay a separate per User fee for each data product and Cboe BZX \nOptions only provides two data feeds that provide only Cboe BZX \nOptions data. Cboe BZX Options also offers the Cboe One Options \nFeed, which provides information for not only Cboe BZX Options, but \nalso its three affiliated options markets, Cboe EDGX Options, Cboe, \nand Cboe C2. See Cboe BZX Options Rule 21.15 (b)(6).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe BZX Options charges Professional Users $30.00 per month and \nNon-Professional Users $1.00 per month for the Cboe BZX Options Depth \nfeed. The Exchange proposes to charge less than Cboe BZX Options and \nprovide access to all of its market data fees for single, and still \nlower, per User fee. Specifically, for ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data \nfeeds, the Exchange proposes to charge Professional Users $20.00 per \nmonth and Non-Professional Users $1.00 per month. The Exchange's \nproposed Professional User fee is lower than Cboe BZX Options and its \nNon-Professional User fee is equal to Cboe BZX Options. However, both \nof the Exchange's proposed fees can be lower than Cboe BZX Options \nbecause a User may receive access to each of the Exchange's data feeds \nfor a single per User fee and, unlike Cboe BZX Options, not be required \nto pay a separate per User fee for each data product.\\36\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\36\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe C2. Cboe C2, with a market share of approximately 3.00% that \nis lower than the Exchange, charges higher Professional and Non-\nProfessional User fees for its C2 Options Depth and C2 COB feed than \nproposed by the Exchange. Unlike Cboe C2, the Exchange proposes to \ncharge a single per User fee that would provide access to all of its \nmarket data products for a single fee.\n    The Cboe C2 Options Depth feed is an options feed that provides \ndepth of book quotations and execution information. The Cboe C2 Options \nDepth feed is similar to the Exchange's MOR data feed. The Cboe C2 COB \nfeed is an options data feed that provides information for complex \nstrategies (multi-leg trades, such as spreads, straddles and buy-\nwrites).\\37\\ The Cboe C2 COB feed is similar to the Exchange's cToM \ndatda feed.\\38\\ Cboe C2 charges all Users, both Professional Users and \nNon-Professional Users, $25.00 per month for the Cboe C2 COB feed and \n$50.00 for the Depth feed.\\39\\ The Exchange proposes to charge less \nthan Cboe C2 for Professional Users and Non-Professional Users while \nalso providing access to all of its market data feeds for a single per \nUser fee. Specifically, for the cToM data feed, the Exchange proposes \nto charge Professional Users $20.00 per month and Non-Professional \nUsers $1.00 per month. The Exchange's proposed Professional User and \nNon-Professional User fees are lower than the fees for the Cboe C2 COB \nfeed. Despite having lower market share than the Exchange, Cboe C2 \ncharges higher or comparable per User fees than proposed by the \nExchange herein.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\37\\ See <a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/market_data_services/us/options/\">https://www.cboe.com/market_data_services/us/options/</a>.\n    \\38\\ Cboe C2 also provides the Cboe C2 Top feed, which provides \ntop of book quotations and execution information. Cboe C2 Top is \nsimilar to the Exchange's ToM feed. Cboe C2 charges Professional \nUsers $5.00 per month and Non-Professional Users $0.10 per month. \nFor ToM, cToM, AIS and MOR data feeds, the Exchange proposes to \ncharge Professional Users $20.00 per month and Non-Professional \nUsers $1.00 per month. Although higher, the Exchange's proposed \nProfessional and Non-Professional User fees are not necessarily \ncomparable to Cboe C2 Top fees because a User may receive access to \neach of the Exchange's four data feeds for a single per User fee \nand, unlike Cboe C2, not be required to pay a separate per User fee \nfor each data product and Cboe C2 only provides three data feeds \nthat provide only Cboe C2 data. It is reasonable, however, to \ncompare the Exchange's data feeds to Cboe C2 data feeds with higher \nper User fees because they charge the higher fee for a single data \nproduct whereas the Exchange includes each of its data products for \na single fee. Cboe C2 also offers the Cboe One Options Feed, which \nprovides information for not only Cboe C2, but also its three \naffiliated options markets, Cboe EDGX Options, Cboe, and Cboe BZX \nOptions.\n    \\39\\ See Cboe C2 Fee Schedule, available at <a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/ctwo/\">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/ctwo/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * * * *\n    Each of the above examples of other exchanges' market data fees \nsupport the proposition that the Exchange's proposed User fees are \ncomparable to those of other exchanges and therefore reasonable.\nNon-Display Usage Fee\n    The proposed Non-Display Usage fee for the Exchange's market data \nproducts is comparable to those charged by Nasdaq Options and Nasdaq \nMRX, as summarized in below table.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           Market share                                Monthly non-display usage\n                Exchange                   [dagger] (%)      Market data products                 fee\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMIAX....................................            6.19  All.......................  $1,500.00 (per feed\n                                                                                       (capped at $3,000.00).\nNasdaq Options..........................            5.45  NOM BONO; NOM ITTO........  $10,530.00 (per exchange).\nNasdaq MRX..............................            2.71  MRX Top; MRX Depth; MRX     $7,575.00 (per exchange).\n                                                           Spread.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[dagger] See supra note 24.\n\n    A more detailed discussion of the comparison follows.\n    Nasdaq Options. Nasdaq Options, with a market share of \napproximately 5.45%, which is comparable to the Exchange's market \nshare, charges higher Non-Display Usage fees for its top of book and \ndepth of book feeds than proposed by the Exchange. Further, Nasdaq \nOptions also charges the full Non-Display Usage fees to receive all of \nits data products, whereas the Exchange proposes to cap the Non-Display \nUsage fee at $3,000.00, which would provide a discount to subscribers \nthat choose to subscribe to multiple Exchange data feeds for Non-\nDisplay Usage.\\40\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\40\\ The Exchange notes that not all options exchanges charge \nnon-display fees for options data. For example, Cboe, Cboe C2, Cboe \nEDGX Options, Cboe BZX Options, BOX, and MEMX Options do not charge \nnon-display fees. Therefore, the Exchange compared its fees to two \ncomparable exchanges, Nasdaq Options and Nasdaq MRX, which charge \nnon-display fees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As discussed above, the Nasdaq Options BONO feed is an options feed \nthat provides Nasdaq Options' best bid and offer and last sale \ninformation.\\41\\ The Nasdaq Options BONO feed is similar to the \nExchange's ToM data feed. The Nasdaq Options ITTO feed is an options \nfeed that provides full order and quote depth information for \nindividual orders and quotes and last sale information.\\42\\ Nasdaq \nOptions ITTO also provides, among other things, product (option series) \navailable for\n\n[[Page 22398]]\n\ntrading on Nasdaq Options, the trading status of such products (i.e., \nwhether the series is available for closing transactions only), and \norder imbalances on opening/reopenings.

The Exchange proposes to cap the amount \nof Non-Display Usage fees for those that subscribe to multiple \nExchange data feeds. Accordingly, even though some market data \nincluded in the AIS feed is included in the Exchange's other data \nfeeds, the Non-Display Usage fee is capped so subscribers would not \nnecessarily pay a higher rate on the Exchange than elsewhere.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Nasdaq Options charges a monthly fee of $10,530.00 for Non-Display \nUsage of the Nasdaq Options BONO feed and Nasdaq Options ITTO feed.\\44\\ \nThe Exchange proposes to charge less than Nasdaq Options while also \nproposing to cap the Non-Display Usage fee at $3,000.00, which would \nprovide a discount to subscribers that choose to subscribe to multiple \nExchange data feeds for Non-Display Usage. Specifically, for the ToM, \ncToM, AIS and MOR data feeds, the Exchange proposes to charge a monthly \nfee of $1,500.00 for Non-Display Usage and to cap the Non-Display Usage \nfee at $3,000.00 for those that wish to receive two or more of the \nExchange's data feeds for Non-Display Usage. This cap would be in lieu \nof paying the full Non-Display Usage Fee for each data product, which \nwould total $6,000.00 per month.

In addition, Nasdaq Options and Nasdaq MRX charge materially \nhigher fees for Non-Display Usage. Meanwhile, Cboe BZX Options and Cboe \nC2 would charge non-display users their applicable distribution fee, \nwhich are not capped and are either higher than, or comparable to, the \nfees proposed by the Exchange. Furthermore, the Exchange proposes to \nonly charge fees to Internal and External Distributors for the ToM, \ncToM, MOR, and AIS feeds, which, when combined with the above proposed \nfees, result in fee packages that are generally comparable to the fee \npackages charged by Nasdaq Options, Nasdaq MRX, Cboe BZX Options, and \nCboe C2 due to those exchanges charging higher or similar User and Non-\nDisplay Usage fees, as set forth above.\n    Lastly, the proposed discount to charge per User fees at the \nExchange level, and not per data feed, as well as capping the monthly \nNon-Display Usage fee for use of multiple data feeds, is reasonable and \ncause the Exchange's proposed fees to be even lower for subscribers to \nmultiple Exchange data products.\n    Pro-Rata Distribution of Fees. The Exchange believes its proposal \nto no longer pro-rate mid-month changes to subscriptions is reasonable \nbecause the Exchange had no mid-month subscriptions or terminations \nover the past twelve (12) months that would have required the monthly \nfee to be pro-rated and no other options exchanges provides for the \nsimilar pro-ration of market data fees.\\50\\ Also, removing these \nprovisions would harmonize the MIAX Fee Schedule with the MIAX Pearl \nEquities Fee Schedule, which does not provide for pro-ration of market \ndata fees.\\51\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\50\\ See Cboe BZX Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section and \nCboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, supra note 13. See also MEMX Options \nFee Schedule, Market Data Fees section and Securities Exchange Act \nRelease No. 101370 (October 17, 2024), 89 FR 84638 (October 23, \n2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n    \\51\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Definitions, and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 \n(June 12, 2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Proposed Fees are Equitably Allocated\n    Overall. The Exchange believes that its proposed fees are \nreasonable, equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory because they are \ndesigned to align fees with services provided. The Exchange believes \nthat the proposed fees for the market data feeds are allocated fairly \nand equitably among the various categories of users of the data feeds, \nand any differences among categories of users are justified and \nappropriate.\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are equitably \nallocated because they will apply uniformly to all data recipients that \nchoose to subscribe to the market data feeds. Any market participant \nthat chooses to subscribe to the market data feeds is subject to the \nsame Fee Schedule, regardless of what type of business they operate, \nand the decision to subscribe to one or more market data feeds is based \non objective differences in usage of market data feeds among different \nMembers, which are still ultimately in the control of any particular \nMember. The Exchange believes the proposed pricing of the market data \nfeeds is equitably allocated because it is based, in part, upon the \namount of information contained in each data feed, which may have \nadditional value to market participants.\n    Pro-Rata Distribution of Fees. The Exchange believes its proposal \nto no longer pro-rate mid-month changes to subscriptions is equitably \nallocated because the Exchange had no subscriber utilize pro-ration via \na mid-month subscription or termination over the past twelve (12) \nmonths, nor does it foresee a subscriber doing so in the near future. \nThe Exchange believes it is equitable to no longer pro-rate fees for \nDistributors who subscribe mid-month because other options exchanges do \nnot provide for the similar pro-ration of market data fees.\\52\\ Also, \nremoving these provisions would harmonize the MIAX Fee Schedule with \nthe MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, which does not provide for pro-\nration of market data fees.\\53\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\52\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section, supra \nnote 13. See also MEMX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees \nsection and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101370 (October 17, \n2024), 89 FR 84638 (October 23, 2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n    \\53\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Definitions, and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 \n(June 12, 2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    User Fees. The Exchange believes that the proposed fee, fee levels, \nand structure that differentiates between Professional User fees from \nNon-Professional User fees for display use are equitable. This \nstructure has long been used by other exchanges and OPRA to reduce the \nprice of data to Non-Professional Users and make it more broadly \navailable.\\54\\ Offering the market data feeds to Non-Professional Users \nat a lower cost than Professional Users results in greater equity among \ndata recipients, as Professional Users are categorized as such based on \ntheir employment and participation in financial markets, and thus, are \ncompensated to participate in the markets. While Non-Professional Users \ntoo can receive significant financial benefits through their \nparticipation in the markets, the Exchange believes it is reasonable to \ncharge more to those Users who are more directly engaged in the \nmarkets.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\54\\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59544 (March \n9, 2009), 74 FR 11162 (March 16, 2009) (SR-NYSE-2008-131) \n(establishing the $15 Non-Professional User Fee (Per User) for NYSE \nOpenBook); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20002, File No. S7-\n433 (July 22, 1983), 48 FR 34552 (July 29, 1983) (establishing Non-\nProfessional fees for CTA data); NASDAQ BX Equity 7 Pricing \nSchedule, Section 123.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Non-Display Usage Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed Non-\nDisplay Usage fees are equitably allocated because they would require \nDistributors to pay fees only for the uses they actually make of the \ndata. As noted above, non-display data can be used by data recipients \nfor a wide variety of profit-generating purposes (including trading and \norder routing) as well as purposes that do not directly generate \nrevenues (such as risk management and compliance) but nonetheless \nsubstantially reduce the recipient's costs by automating certain \nfunctions. The Exchange believes that it is equitable to charge non-\ndisplay data Distributors that use the market data feeds because all \nsuch Distributors would have the ability to use such data for as many \nnon-display uses as they wish for one low fee. As noted above, this \nstructure is comparable to that in place for the exchanges referenced \nabove and several other exchanges charge multiple non-display fees to \nthe same client to the extent they use a data feed in several different \ntrading platforms or for several types of non-display use.\\55\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\55\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, available at <a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/bzx/\">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/bzx/</a> (providing fees \nof $2,000.00 to $3,000.00 for Distribution, which includes Non-\nDisplay use); Cboe C2 Fee Schedule, available at <a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/ctwo/\">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/ctwo/</a> (providing a \nfee $2,500.00 for Distribution, which includes Non-Display use); \nNasdaq Options Fee Schedule, available at, <a href=\"https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions\">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions</a> (providing a \nfee of $10,000.00 for Non-Display Use); and the NYSE American fee \nschedule available at <a href=\"https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Market_Data_Pricing.pdf\">https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Market_Data_Pricing.pdf</a> (providing a fee of $5,000.00 for Non-\nDisplay Use).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * * * *\n    For all of the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the \nproposed fees for the market data feeds are equitably allocated.\nThe Proposed Fees Are Not Unfairly Discriminatory\n    The Exchange believes the proposed fees are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory\n\n[[Page 22400]]\n\nbecause any differences in the application of the fees are based on \nmeaningful distinctions between customers, and those meaningful \ndistinctions are not unfairly discriminatory between customers.\n    Overall. The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are not \nunfairly discriminatory because they would apply to all data recipients \nthat choose to subscribe to the same market data feed(s). Any market \nparticipant, including market data vendors, that chooses to subscribe \nto the market data feeds is subject to the same Fee Schedule, \nregardless of what type of business they operate. Market participants \nseeking lower cost options may instead choose to receive data from OPRA \nor another potentially lower cost option such as a market data vendor. \nThe Exchange notes that market participants can also choose to \nsubscribe to a combination of data feeds for redundancy purposes or to \nuse different feeds for different purposes. In sum, each market \nparticipant has the ability to choose the best business solution for \nitself. The Exchange does not believe it is unfairly discriminatory to \nbase pricing upon the amount of information contained in each data feed \nand the importance of that information to market participants. As \ndescribed above, the ToM data feed can be utilized to trade on the \nExchange but contains less information than available on the MOR data \nfeed. Thus, the Exchange believes it is not unfairly discriminatory for \nthe products to be priced as proposed, with the same fees being \nproposed for each data feed coupled with the discounts and caps \ndiscussed above.\n    Pro-Rata Distribution of Fees. The Exchange believes that the \nproposal to no longer pro-rate mid-month changes to market data \nsubscriptions is not unfairly discriminatory because there were no mid-\nmonth subscriptions or terminations over the past twelve (12) months \nthat would have required the monthly fee to be pro-rated. The Exchange \nnotes that other options exchanges do not provide for the similar pro-\nration of market data fees.\\56\\ Also, removing these provisions would \nharmonize the MIAX Fee Schedule with the MIAX Pearl Equities Fee \nSchedule, which does not provide for pro-ration.\\57\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\56\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section, supra \nnote 13. See also MEMX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees \nsection and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101370 (October 17, \n2024), 89 FR 84638 (October 23, 2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n    \\57\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Definitions and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 \n(June 12, 2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    User Fees. The Exchange believes that the proposed fee, fee levels, \nand structure that differentiates between Professional User fees from \nNon-Professional User fees for display use are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory. This structure has long been used by other exchanges \nand OPRA to reduce the price of data to Non-Professional Users and make \nit more broadly available. Offering the market data feeds to Non-\nProfessional Users with the same data as is available to Professional \nUsers, albeit at a lower cost, results in greater equity among data \nrecipients. These User fees would be charged uniformly to all \nindividuals that have access to the market data feeds based on the \ncategory of User.\n    The Exchange also believes the proposed User fees are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory, with higher fees for Professional Users than Non-\nProfessional Users, because Non-Professional Users may have less \nability to pay for such data than Professional Users as well as less \nopportunity to profit from their usage of such data.\n    Non-Display Usage Fees. The Exchange believes that the proposed \nNon-Display Usage fees are not unfairly discriminatory because they \nwould require Distributors for non-display use to pay fees depending on \ntheir use of the data. As noted above, non-display data can be used by \ndata recipients for a wide variety of profit-generating purposes as \nwell as purposes that do not directly generate revenues but nonetheless \nsubstantially reduce the recipient's costs by automating certain \nfunctions.\n* * * * *\n    For all of the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the \nproposed fees for the Exchange's market data feeds are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\\58\\ the Exchange \ndoes not believe that the proposed rule change would impose any burden \non competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of \nthe purposes of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\58\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntra-Market Competition\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed fees place certain \nmarket participants at a relative disadvantage to other market \nparticipants because, as noted above, the proposed fees are associated \nwith usage of the data feed by each market participant, which are still \nultimately in the control of any particular Member, and such fees do \nnot impose a barrier to entry to smaller participants. Accordingly, the \nproposed fees do not favor certain categories of market participants in \na manner that would impose a burden on competition; rather, the \nallocation of the proposed fees reflects the types of data consumed by \nvarious market participants and their usage thereof. The Exchange also \nbelieves that the proposed fees neither favor nor penalize one or more \ncategories of market participants in a manner that would impose an \nundue burden on competition.\n    The Exchange believes its proposal to no longer pro-rate mid-month \nchanges to market data subscriptions does not place an undue burden on \nintra-market competition because all market participants will be \nsubject to the same Fee Schedule, regardless of which point in the \nmonth they subscribe. As noted above, there were no mid-month \nsubscriptions or terminations over the past twelve (12) months that \nwould have required the monthly fee to be pro-rated. The Exchange notes \nthat other options exchanges do not provide for the similar pro-ration \nof market data fees.\\59\\ Also, removing these provisions would \nharmonize the MIAX Fee Schedule with the MIAX Pearl Equities Fee \nSchedule, which does not provide for pro-ration.\\60\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\59\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section. See \nalso MEMX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section and \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 101370 (October 17, 2024), 89 FR \n84638 (October 23, 2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n    \\60\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Definitions and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 \n(June 12, 2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInter-Market Competition\n    The Exchange does not believe the proposed fees place an undue \nburden on competition on other SROs that is not necessary or \nappropriate. In particular, market participants are not forced to \nsubscribe to either data feed, as described above. An exchange that \noverprices its market data products stands a high risk that users may \npurchase another market's market data product. These competitive \npressures ensure that no one exchange's market data fees can impose an \nunnecessary burden on competition, and the Exchange's proposed fees do \nnot do so here. Additionally, other exchanges have similar market data \nfees with comparable rates in place for their participants. Other \noptions exchanges are free to adopt comparable fee\n\n[[Page 22401]]\n\nstructures subject to the Commission's rule filing process.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.\n\nIII.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to amend the NYSE National Schedule of Fees \nand Rebates (``Fee Schedule'') to reflect the fee for orders routed \npursuant to the Retail Price Improvement Seeking routing strategy. The \nproposed change is available on the Exchange's website at <a href=\"http://www.nyse.com\">www.nyse.com</a>, \nat the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public \nReference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization \nincluded statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the \nproposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the \nproposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at \nthe places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared \nsummaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most \nsignificant parts of such statements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to reflect the fee \nfor orders routed pursuant to the Retail Price Improvement Seeking \nrouting strategy. The Exchange proposes to implement the fee change \neffective May 13, 2025.\nBackground\n    The Exchange operates in a highly competitive market. The \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has repeatedly \nexpressed its preference for competition over regulatory intervention \nin determining prices, products, and services in the securities \nmarkets. In Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance \nof market forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, \nrecognized that current regulation of the market system ``has been \nremarkably successful in promoting market competition in its broader \nforms that are most important to investors and listed companies.'' \\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (File No. S7-10-04) (Final \nRule) (``Regulation NMS'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    While Regulation NMS has enhanced competition, it has also fostered \na ``fragmented'' market structure where trading in a single stock can \noccur\n\n[[Page 22402]]\n\nacross multiple trading centers. When multiple trading centers compete \nfor order flow in the same stock, the Commission has recognized that \n``such competition can lead to the fragmentation of order flow in that \nstock.'' \\5\\ Indeed, equity trading is currently dispersed across 16 \nexchanges,\\6\\ numerous alternative trading systems,\\7\\ and broker-\ndealer internalizers and wholesalers, all competing for order flow. \nBased on publicly available information, no single exchange currently \nhas more than 20% market share.\\8\\ Therefore, no exchange possesses \nsignificant pricing power in the execution of equity order flow. More \nspecifically, the Exchange's share of executed volume of equity trades \nin Tapes A, B and C securities combined is less than 1%.\\9\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61358, 75 FR 3594, \n3597 (January 21, 2010) (File No. S7-02-10) (Concept Release on \nEquity Market Structure).\n    \\6\\ See Cboe U.S Equities Market Volume Summary, available at \n<a href=\"https://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share\">https://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share</a>. See generally \n<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/divisionsmarketregmrexchangesshtml.html\">https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/divisionsmarketregmrexchangesshtml.html</a>.\n    \\7\\ See FINRA ATS Transparency Data, available at <a href=\"https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/AtsIssueData\">https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/AtsIssueData</a>. A list of \nalternative trading systems registered with the Commission is \navailable at <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/atslist.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/atslist.htm</a>.\n    \\8\\ See Cboe Global Markets U.S. Equities Market Volume Summary, \navailable at <a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share/</a>.\n    \\9\\ See id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes that the ever-shifting market share among the \nexchanges from month to month demonstrates that market participants can \nmove order flow, or discontinue or reduce use of certain categories of \nproducts. While it is not possible to know a firm's reason for shifting \norder flow, the Exchange believes that one such reason is because of \nfee changes at any of the registered exchanges or non-exchange venues \nto which a firm routes order flow. Accordingly, competitive forces \nconstrain exchange transaction fees, and market participants can \nreadily trade on competing venues if they deem pricing levels at those \nother venues to be more favorable.\nProposed Rule Change\n    Pursuant to Commission approval, the Exchange has amended its rules \nto provide for the optional Retail Price Improvement Seeking routing \nstrategy, which is available for Type 1 Retail Orders that participate \nin the Exchange's Retail Liquidity Program.\\10\\ After checking the \nExchange Book for available shares, any remaining quantity of a Type 1 \nRetail Order designated with the Retail Price Improvement Seeking \nrouting strategy will be routed to New York Stock Exchange, LLC \n(``NYSE''). Any shares that remain unexecuted after routing will be \ncancelled. The Retail Price Improvement Seeking routing strategy is \nintended to offer any remaining quantity of Type 1 Retail Orders, after \nexecuting against interest on the Exchange Book, the opportunity to \naccess liquidity on the NYSE, which also operates a retail liquidity \nprogram. Type 1 Retail Orders routed to the NYSE with the Retail Price \nImprovement Seeking routing strategy would be able to interact with \nRetail Price Improvement Orders and other interest on the NYSE book as \na Retail Order in the NYSE retail liquidity program, thereby providing \nsuch orders with additional price improvement opportunities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102912 (April 22, \n2025), 90 FR 17655 (April 28, 2025) (SR-NYSENAT-2025-05) (Order \nApproving a Proposed Rule Change To Amend NYSE National Rules 7.37 \nand 7.44); see also Rule 7.37(b)(9)(C).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In connection with the availability of the Retail Price Improvement \nSeeking routing strategy on May 13, 2025,\\11\\ the Exchange proposes to \namend the Fee Schedule to reflect the routing fee that will apply to \norders routed pursuant to the Retail Price Improvement Seeking routing \nstrategy. In the table under Section II of the Fee Schedule, which sets \nforth routing fees applicable to all ETP Holders, the Exchange proposes \nto add text specifying that, for orders in securities at or above \n$1.00, there would be no fee for orders routed pursuant to the Retail \nPrice Improvement Seeking routing strategy (as described in Rule \n7.37(b)(9)(C)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See <a href=\"https://www.nyse.com/trader-update/history#110000948947\">https://www.nyse.com/trader-update/history#110000948947</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes that this routing functionality would provide \nretail orders with access to additional retail liquidity and price \nimprovement opportunities on another trading venue. This routing \nfunctionality is completely optional, and ETP Holders can readily \nselect from among various providers of routing services, including \nother exchanges and non-exchange venues. ETP Holders that choose not to \nutilize this routing strategy would continue to be able to trade on the \nExchange as they currently do.\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent \nwith Section 6(b) of the Act,\\12\\ in general, and furthers the \nobjectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and (5) of the Act,\\13\\ in particular, \nbecause it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, \nfees, and other charges among its members, issuers and other persons \nusing its facilities and does not unfairly discriminate between \ncustomers, issuers, brokers or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\13\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As discussed above, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive \nmarket. The Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for \ncompetition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, \nproducts, and services in the securities markets. In Regulation NMS, \nthe Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in \ndetermining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current \nregulation of the market system ``has been remarkably successful in \npromoting market competition in its broader forms that are most \nimportant to investors and listed companies.'' \\14\\ While Regulation \nNMS has enhanced competition, it has also fostered a ``fragmented'' \nmarket structure where trading in a single stock can occur across \nmultiple trading centers. When multiple trading centers compete for \norder flow in the same stock, the Commission has recognized that ``such \ncompetition can lead to the fragmentation of order flow in that \nstock.'' \\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ See supra note 4.\n    \\15\\ See supra note 5.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes that the ever-shifting market share among the \nexchanges from month to month demonstrates that market participants can \nshift order flow, or discontinue or reduce use of certain categories of \nproducts, in response to fee changes. Accordingly, changes to exchange \ntransaction fees can have a direct effect on the ability of an exchange \nto compete for order flow.\n    The Retail Price Improvement Seeking routing strategy is intended \nto provide Type 1 Retail Orders with the option to, after interacting \nwith interest on the Exchange Book, route remaining quantities to the \nNYSE to access additional retail liquidity. This routing functionality \nis provided by the Exchange on a voluntary basis, and no rule or \nregulation requires that the Exchange offer it. Nor does any rule or \nregulation require market participants to route orders in this manner. \nAs noted above, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market in \nwhich market participants can readily select between various providers \nof routing services with different product offerings and different \npricing. The Exchange believes its proposal to not charge any fee for \norders routed pursuant to the Retail Price Improvement Seeking routing \nstrategy is reasonable to encourage use\n\n[[Page 22403]]\n\nof the routing strategy and to facilitate additional trading \nopportunities for retail order at no additional cost.\n    The Exchange believes its proposal equitably allocates its fees \namong market participants. The Exchange believes that the proposal \nrepresents an equitable allocation of fees because it would apply \nuniformly to all orders routed pursuant to the Retail Price Improvement \nSeeking Strategy, in that all Type 1 Retail Orders may be optionally \ndesignated with the Retail Price Improvement Seeking routing strategy, \nand no such orders would be subject to any routing fee for utilizing \nthe functionality. Without having a view of ETP Holders' activity on \nother exchanges and off-exchange venues, the Exchange has no way of \nknowing whether this proposed rule change would serve as an incentive \nor disincentive to utilize the routing strategy. However, the Exchange \nbelieves that a number of ETP Holders would seek to utilize the routing \nfunctionality, which would facilitate access to additional price \nimprovement opportunities for retail orders on another trading venue at \nno charge.\n    The Exchange reiterates that the routing functionality offered by \nthe Exchange is completely optional and that the Exchange operates in a \nhighly competitive market in which market participants can readily \nselect between various providers of routing services with different \nproduct offerings and different pricing. The Exchange believes that the \nproposed fee for orders routed pursuant to the Retail Price Improvement \nSeeking routing strategy is a fair and equitable approach to pricing.\n    The Exchange believes that the proposal is not unfairly \ndiscriminatory because it applies on an equal basis to all orders \nrouted pursuant to the Retail Price Improvement Seeking routing \nstrategy. Moreover, this proposed rule change neither targets, nor will \nit have a disparate impact on, any particular category of market \nparticipant. The Exchange believes that this proposal does not permit \nunfair discrimination because the proposed fee described in this \nproposal would apply to all retail orders designated with the Retail \nPrice Improvement Seeking routing strategy. Accordingly, no member \norganization already operating on the Exchange would be disadvantaged \nby the proposed allocation of fees. The Exchange further believes that \nthe proposed rule change would not permit unfair discrimination because \nthe routing functionality would remain available to similarly-situated \nETP Holders on an equal basis, and each such participant would be \nsubject to the same fee for using the functionality.\n    Finally, the submission of orders to the Exchange is optional for \nETP Holders in that they could choose whether to submit orders to the \nExchange and, if they do, the extent of its activity in this regard. \nThe Exchange believes that it is subject to significant competitive \nforces, as described below in the Exchange's statement regarding the \nburden on competition.\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the proposal \nis consistent with the Act.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\\16\\ the Exchange \nbelieves that the proposed rule change would not impose any burden on \ncompetition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the \npurposes of the Act. The Exchange believes that the proposed change \nfurthers the Commission's goal in adopting Regulation NMS of fostering \nintegrated competition among orders, which promotes ``more efficient \npricing of individual stocks for all types of orders, large and \nsmall.'' \\17\\ The Exchange does not believe that the proposed fee \nchange represents a significant departure from previous pricing offered \nby the Exchange or pricing offered by the Exchange's competitors. ETP \nHolders may opt to disfavor the Exchange's pricing if they believe that \nalternatives offer them better value. Accordingly, the Exchange does \nnot believe that the proposed change will impair the ability of ETP \nHolders or competing venues to maintain their competitive standing in \nthe financial markets.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).\n    \\17\\ See supra note 4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Intramarket Competition. The Exchange believes the proposed \namendment to its Fee Schedule would not impose any burden on \ncompetition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the \npurposes of the Act. The Retail Price Improvement Seeking routing \nstrategy is available to all Type 1 Retail Orders, and all orders \nrouted pursuant to the strategy would be subject to the same proposed \nfee. This routing functionality is provided by the Exchange on a \nvoluntary basis, and no rule or regulation requires that the Exchange \noffer it. ETP Holders have the choice whether or not to use the Retail \nPrice Improvement Seeking routing strategy, and those that choose not \nto utilize it will not be impacted by the proposed rule change. The \nExchange also does not believe the proposed rule change would impact \nintramarket competition, as the proposed fee would apply equally to all \nETP Holders that choose to utilize the Retail Price Improvement Seeking \nrouting strategy, and therefore the proposed change would not impose a \ndisparate burden on competition among market participants on the \nExchange.\n    Intermarket Competition. The Exchange operates in a highly \ncompetitive market in which market participants can readily choose to \nsend their orders to other exchange and off-exchange venues if they \ndeem fee levels at those other venues to be more favorable. As noted \nabove, the Exchange's market share of intraday trading (i.e., excluding \nauctions) is currently less than 1%. In such an environment, the \nExchange must continually adjust its fees and rebates to remain \ncompetitive with other exchanges and with off-exchange venues. Because \ncompetitors are free to modify their own fees and credits in response, \nand because market participants may readily adjust their order routing \npractices, the Exchange does not believe its proposed fee change can \nimpose any burden on intermarket competition.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act,\\18\\ and Rule 19b-\n4(f)(2) thereunder \\19\\ the Exchange has designated this proposal as \nestablishing or changing a due, fee, or other charge imposed on any \nperson, whether or not the person is a member of the self-regulatory \norganization, which renders the proposed rule change effective upon \nfiling. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule \nchange, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii).\n    \\19\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to increase the monthly fee for 10 Gb \nphysical ports. The text of the proposed rule change is provided in \nExhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at \nthe Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule relating to \nphysical connectivity fees.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange initially filed the proposed fee changes on \nJuly 3, 2023 (SR-CboeEDGX-2023-045). On September 1, 2023, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2023-058. On \nSeptember 29, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a \nSuspension of and Order Instituting Proceedings to Determine whether \nto Approve or Disapprove a Proposed Rule Change to Amend its Fees \nSchedule Related to Physical Port Fees (the ``OIP'') in anticipation \nof a possible U.S. government shutdown.''). On September 29, 2023, \nthe Exchange filed the proposed fee change (SR-CboeEDGX-2023-063). \nOn October 13, 2023, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted \nSR-CboeEDGX-2023-064. On December 12, 2023, the Exchange withdrew \nthat filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2023-080. On February 12, \n2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-\n2024-014. On April 9, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and \nsubmitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-021. On June 7, 2024, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-036. On August \n29, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-\nCboeEDGX-2024-057. On October 25, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-072. On December 18, 2024, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-086. On \nFebruary 14, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted \nSR-CboeEDGX-2025-012. On March 13, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2025-023. On May 9, 2025, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, a physical port is utilized by a Member or \nnon-Member to connect to the Exchange at the data centers where the \nExchange's servers are located. The Exchange currently assesses the \nfollowing physical connectivity fees for Members and non-Members on a \nmonthly basis: $2,500 per physical port for a 1 gigabit (``Gb'') \ncircuit and $7,500 per physical port for a 10 Gb circuit. The Exchange \nproposes to increase the monthly fee for 10 Gb physical ports from \n$7,500 to $8,500 per port. The Exchange notes the proposed fee change \nbetter enables it to continue to maintain and improve its market \ntechnology and services and also notes that the proposed fee amount, \neven as amended, continues to be in line with, or even lower than, \namounts assessed by other exchanges for similar connections.\\4\\ The \nExchange also notes\n\n[[Page 22405]]\n\nthat a single 10 Gb physical port can be used to access the Systems of \nthe following affiliate exchanges: the Cboe BYX Exchange, Inc., Cboe \nBZX Exchange, Inc. (options and equities platforms), Cboe EDGA \nExchange, Inc., and Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc., (``Affiliate \nExchanges'').\\5\\ Notably, only one monthly fee currently (and will \ncontinue) to apply per 10 Gb physical port regardless of how many \naffiliated exchanges are accessed through that one port.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See e.g., The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), General \n8, Connectivity to the Exchange. Nasdaq and its affiliated exchanges \ncharge a monthly fee of $16,500 for each 10 Gb Ultra fiber \nconnection to the respective exchange. See also New York Stock \nExchange LLC, NYSE American LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc., NYSE Chicago Inc., \nNYSE National, Inc. Connectivity Fee Schedule, which provides that \n10 Gb LX LCN Circuits (which are analogous to the Exchange's 10 Gb \nphysical port) are assessed $22,000 per month, per port.\n    \\5\\ The Affiliate Exchanges are also submitting contemporaneous \nidentical rule filings.\n    \\6\\ The Exchange notes that conversely, other exchange groups \ncharge separate port fees for access to separate, but affiliated, \nexchanges. See e.g., Securities and Exchange Release No. 99822 \n(March 21, 2024), 89 FR 21337 (March 27, 2024) (SR-MIAX-2024-016).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\7\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\8\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\9\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) \\10\\ of the Act, which \nrequires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of \nreasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other \npersons using its facilities. This belief is based on various factors \nas described below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\8\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\9\\ Id.\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    First, the Exchange believes its proposal is reasonable as it \nreflects a moderate increase in physical connectivity fees for 10 Gb \nphysical ports and its offering, even as amended, continues to be more \naffordable as compared to analogous physical connectivity offerings at \ncompetitor exchanges. For example, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC \n(``Nasdaq'') and its affiliated exchanges charge a monthly fee of \n$16,500 for each 10 Gbps Ultra fiber connection and $11,000 per month \nfor each 10 Gbps fiber connection to their respective exchange.\\11\\ The \nExchange's proposed fee of $8,500 per physical port is lower than both \nof these offerings.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), General 8, \nConnectivity to the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Yet another example of higher fees charged by a competitor exchange \nis the 10Gpbs LX LCN Circuits offered by the New York Stock Exchange \nLLC and its affiliates (collectively, ``NYSE''). NYSE charges a fee of \n$22,000 per month,\\12\\ per port in contrast to the Exchange's proposed \nmonthly fee of $8,500 per month, per port. Despite the Exchange \nproposing to increase its fee for its 10 Gb physical port, it still \ncomes in at a cost significantly lower than its competitors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See New York Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE American LLC, NYSE \nArca, Inc., NYSE Chicago Inc., NYSE National, Inc. Connectivity Fee \nSchedule\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Lastly, the Exchange also points towards the equivalent offering \nfrom MIAX Saphire and its affiliated options exchanges, MIAX Options, \nMIAX Pearl and MIAX Emerald (collectively, ``MIAX Exchanges'') which is \n$13,500 per port per month.\\13\\ The Exchange reiterates that a single \nphysical port offering from the Exchange offers the ability to connect \nto the Affiliated Exchanges (equities and options) and the monthly \nprice does not change based on the number of exchanges a participant is \nconnected to. In this case, examining only the Exchange and its \nAffiliated Options Exchanges, (even though the same physical port could \nalso connect to the Exchange's affiliated equities exchanges) a \nparticipant could purchase a single physical port from the Exchange and \naccess roughly 14% of the U.S. Options Market for a cost of $8,500. In \ncontrast, if a participant desired to access all MIAX Exchanges, \nallowing access to roughly 16% of the U.S. Options Market, it would \ncost that participant $54,000 ($13,500 per port per month x 4 MIAX \nExchanges).\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See e.g., MIAX Options Fee Schedule.\n    \\14\\ See Cboe U.S. Options Market Volume Summary (May 8, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes the current fee does not properly \nreflect the quality of the service and product, as fees for 10 Gb \nphysical ports have been static in nominal terms since 2018, and \ntherefore falling in real terms due to inflation. As a general matter, \nthe Producer Price Index (``PPI'') is a family of indexes that measures \nthe average change over time in selling prices received by domestic \nproducers of goods and services. PPI measures price change from the \nperspective of the seller. This contrasts with other metrics, such as \nthe Consumer Price Index (CPI), that measure price change from the \npurchaser's perspective.\\15\\ About 10,000 PPIs for individual products \nand groups of products are tracked and released each month.\\16\\ PPIs \nare available for the output of nearly all industries in the goods-\nproducing sectors of the U.S. economy--mining, manufacturing, \nagriculture, fishing, and forestry--as well as natural gas, \nelectricity, and construction, among others. The PPI program covers \napproximately 69 percent of the service sector's output, as measured by \nrevenue reported in the 2017 Economic Census.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>.\n    \\16\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For purposes of this proposal, the relevant industry-specific PPI \nis the Data Processing, hosting and related services (``Data PPI'') and \nmore particularly the more granular service line Data Processing, \nHosting and Related Services: Hosting, Active Server Pages (ASP), and \nOther Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure Provisioning \nServices.\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Provisioning is the process of preparing, assigning, and \nactivating IT infrastructure components, such as servers, storage, \nand network connectivity, according to user requirements. It is a \ncritical part of IT operations, as it ensures that computing \nresources are available when needed and that they are set up and \nconnected to work correctly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Data PPI was introduced in January 2002 by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics (``BLS'') as part of an ongoing effort to expand Producer \nPrice Index coverage of the services sector of the U.S. economy and is \nidentified as NAICS-518210 in the North American Industry \nClassification System (``NAICS'').\\18\\ According to the BLS ``[t]he \nprimary output of NAICS 518210 is the provision of electronic data \nprocessing services. In the broadest sense, computer services companies \nhelp their customers efficiently use\n\n[[Page 22406]]\n\ntechnology. The processing services market consists of vendors who use \ntheir own computer systems--often utilizing proprietary software-- to \nprocess customers' transactions and data. Price movements for the NAICS \n518210 index are based on changes in the revenue received by companies \nthat provide data processing services and price movements for the \nservice line NAICS 518210 index are based on changes in the revenue \nreceived by companies that provide, among other things, IT \ninfrastructure provisioning services. Each month, companies provide net \ntransaction prices for a specified service. The transaction is an \nactual contract selected by probability, where the price-determining \ncharacteristics are held constant while the service is repriced. The \nprices used in index calculation are the actual prices billed for the \nselected service contract.'' \\19\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>. Among the \nindustry-specific PPIs is for North American Industry Classification \nSystem (``NAICS'') Code 518210: ``Data Processing and Related \nServices,'' NAICS index codes categorize products and services that \nare common to particular industries. According to BLS, these codes \n``provide comparability with a wide assortment of industry-based \ndata for other economic programs, including productivity, \nproduction, employment, wages, and earnings.''\n    \\19\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-services-industry-naics-518210.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-services-industry-naics-518210.htm</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The service (product) lines for which price indexes are available \nunder the Data PPI are: (1) business process management services (2) \ndata management and storage information transformation and other \nservices and (3) hosting ASP and other IT infrastructure provisioning \nservices. The most apt of these industry and product specific \ncategorizations for purposes of this present proposal to modify fees \nfor the 10 Gb physical port fee measures inflation for the provision of \ndata processing, hosting and related services as well as other \ninformation technology infrastructure provisioning services which BLS \nidentifies as identified as NAICS-5182105.\\20\\ The Exchange believes \nthat this measure of inflation is particularly appropriate because the \nExchange's connectivity services involve hosting and providing \nconnections to its customers' telecommunications and information \ntechnology equipment, as well as preparing, assigning, and activating \nIT infrastructure components, such as servers, storage, and network \nconnectivity. The Exchange also uses its ``proprietary software,'' \ni.e., its own proprietary matching engine software, to receive orders \non the Exchange's proprietary trading platform as well as to collect, \norganize, store and report customers' transactions. In other words, the \nExchange is in the business of data processing, hosting, ASP, and \nproviding other IT infrastructure provisioning services. Specifically, \nwithin this category, the Exchange points to the financial business \nprocess management services category under the umbrella of data \nprocessing.\\21\\ The financial business process management services is \ndescribed as ``providing a bundled service package that combines \ninformation-technology-intensive services with labor (manual or \nprofessional depending on the solution), machinery, and facilities to \nsupport, host and manage a financial business process for a client, \nsuch as financial transaction processing, credit card processing, \npayment services, and lending services.'' \\22\\ The Exchange's \nconnectivity service provides connections to its customers' \ntelecommunications and information technology equipment, as well as \npreparing, assigning, and activating IT infrastructure components to \nfacilitate the transmission of orders and receipt of financial \ntransactions for its customers' while connected to the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ See <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105\">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105</a>.\n    \\21\\ See <a href=\"https://voorburggroup.org/Documents/2018%20Rome/Papers/1014.pdf\">https://voorburggroup.org/Documents/2018%20Rome/Papers/1014.pdf</a>.\n    \\22\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, the Exchange believes that this specific index is best \nsuited to guide this price increase as it reflects the change in this \nspecific instance over the last seven years instead of looking at the \nunderlying components of the service. PPI has published broad guidance \nregarding price adjustments for contracts,\\23\\ and within this it noted \nthat contracting parties should choose an index or group of indexes \nthat represent the cost for providing a particular product or service, \nrather than an index for the product itself.\\24\\ While this helps a \ncontracting seller avoid a circumstance where it is unable to raise its \nprice for the product itself if the underlying components have \nincreased and the PPI for the product itself has not yet increased- \nthis is not the case here. The Exchange instead is using historical \ndata over a seven-year period as a reference point for its proposed \nincrease moving forward- underlying components that have increased over \nthe course of seven years have since (by and large) been reflected in \nthe product itself.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting-parties.htm#FOOT5\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting-parties.htm#FOOT5</a>.\n    \\24\\ ``For example, if an apparel manufacturer were contracting \nfor long-term purchases with a producer of finished fabrics, it \nwould be more advisable to tie the price adjustment clause to a PPI \nfor synthetic fibers, processed yarns and threads, or greige fabrics \n(raw fabric), rather than to a PPI for a type of finished fabric.'' \nId.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange further believes the Data PPI is an appropriate \nmeasure for purposes of the proposed rule change on the basis that it \nis a stable metric with limited volatility, unlike other consumer-side \ninflation metrics. In fact, the Data PPI has not experienced a greater \nthan 2.16% increase for any one calendar year period since Data PPI was \nintroduced into the PPI in January 2002. For example, the average \ncalendar year change from January 2002 to December 2023 was .62%, with \na cumulative increase of 15.67% over this 21-year period. The Exchange \nbelieves the Data PPI is considerably less volatile than other \ninflation metrics such as CPI, which has had individual calendar-year \nincreases of more than 6.5%, and a cumulative increase of over 73% over \nthe same period.\\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ See <a href=\"https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/\">https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As noted above, the current 10 Gb physical port fee remained \nunchanged for almost seven years, particularly since June 2018.\\26\\ \nSince its last increase almost 7 years ago however, there has been \nnotable inflation, including under the industry- and product-specific \nPPI, which as described above is a tailored measure of inflation. \nParticularly, the Hosting, ASP and other IT Infrastructure Provisioning \nServices inflation measure had a starting value of 102.2 in June 2018 \n(the month the Exchange started assessing the current fee) and an \nending value of 118.502 in January 2025, representing a 16% \nincrease.\\27\\ This indicates that companies who are also in the hosting \nASP and other IT infrastructure provisioning services have generally \nincreased prices for a specified service covered under NAICS 5182105 by \nan average of 16% during this period.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\26\\ See Securities and Exchange Release No. 83430 (June 14, \n2018), 83 FR 28697 (June 20, 2018) (SR-CboeEDGX-2018-017).\n    \\27\\ See <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105\">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes that it is reasonable to increase its \nfees to compensate for inflation because, over time, inflation has \ndegraded the value of each dollar that the Exchange collects in fees, \nsuch that the real revenue collected today is considerably less than \nthat same revenue collected in 2018. The impact of this inflationary \neffect is also independent of any change in the Exchange's costs in \nproviding its goods and services. The Exchange therefore believes that \nit is reasonable for it to offset, in part, this erosion in the value \nof the revenues it collects. Additionally, the Exchange historically \ndoes not increase fees every year notwithstanding inflation.\\28\\ Other \nexchanges have also\n\n[[Page 22407]]\n\nfiled for increases in certain fees, based in part on comparisons to \ninflation.\\29\\ Accordingly, based on the above-described percentage \nchange based on an industry- and product-specific inflationary measure, \nand in conjunction with the rationale further described above and \nbelow, the Exchange believes the proposed fee increase is reasonable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ As the Exchange historically does not increase fees every \nyear notwithstanding inflation, the Exchange believes that the more \nspecific index is appropriate to look at as it is reflective of the \ncumulative increase over the course of almost seven years. While the \nPPI has published guidance that a broader index may be more helpful \nto reference in a contract to avoid large swings on a shorter \nduration (and to which such a swing over a brief duration may \ntrigger additional obligations), the Exchange, in contrast, is \ninstead looking forward to adjust its price to reflect changes in \nthe industry over the past seven years. See supra note 20.\n    \\29\\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-100994 \n(September 10, 2024), 89 FR 75612 (September 16, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-\n2024-79).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Next, the Exchange believes significant investments into, and \nenhanced performance of, the Exchange, in the years following the last \n10 Gb physical port fee increase support the reasonableness of the \nproposed fee increase. These investments enhanced the quality of its \nservices, as measured by, among other things, increased throughput and \nfaster processing speeds. Customers have therefore greatly benefitted \nfrom these investments, while the Exchange's ability to recoup its \ninvestments has been hampered.\n    For example, the Exchange and its affiliated exchanges recently \nlaunched a multi-year initiative to improve Cboe Exchange Platform \nperformance and capacity requirements to increase competitiveness, \nsupport growth and advance a consistent world class platform. The goal \nof the project, among other things, is to provide faster and more \nconsistent order handling and matching performance for options, while \nensuring quicker processing time and supporting increasing volumes and \ncapacity needs. For example, the Exchange recently performed switch \nhardware upgrades. Particularly, the Exchange replaced existing \ncustomer access switches with newer models, which the Exchange believes \nresulted in increased determinism. The recent switch upgrades also \nincreased the Exchange's capacity to accommodate more physical ports by \nnearly 50%. Network bandwidth was also increased nearly two-fold as a \nresult of the upgrades, which among other things, can lead to reduce \nmessage queuing. The Exchange also believes these newer models result \nin less natural variance in the processing of messages. The Exchange \nnotes that it incurred costs associated with purchasing and upgrading \nto these newer models, of which the Exchange has not otherwise passed \nthrough or offset.\n    As of April 1, 2024, market participants also having the option of \nconnecting to a new data center (i.e., Secaucus NY6 Data Center \n(``NY6'')), in addition to the current data centers at NY4 and NY5. The \nExchange made NY6 available in response to customer requests in \nconnection with their need for additional space and capacity. In order \nto make this space available, the Exchange expended significant \nresources to prepare this space, and will also incur ongoing costs with \nrespect to maintaining this offering, including costs related to power, \nspace, fiber, cabinets, panels, labor and maintenance of racks. The \nExchange also incurred a large cost with respect to ensuring NY6 would \nbe latency equalized, as it is for NY4 and NY5.\n    The Exchange also has made various other improvements since the \ncurrent physical port rates were adopted in 2018. For example, the \nExchange has updated its customer portal to provide more transparency \nwith respect to firms' respective connectivity subscriptions, enabling \nthem to better monitor, evaluate and adjust their connections based on \ntheir evolving business needs. The Exchange also performs proactive \naudits on a weekly basis to ensure that all customer cross connects \ncontinue to fall within allowable tolerances for Latency Equalized \nconnections. Accordingly, the Exchange expended, and will continue to \nexpend, resources to innovate and modernize technology so that it may \nbenefit its Members and continue to compete among other options \nmarkets. The ability to continue to innovate with technology and offer \nnew products to market participants allows the Exchange to remain \ncompetitive in the options space which currently has 18 registered \noptions markets and potential new entrants. If the Exchange were not \nable to assess incrementally higher fees for its connectivity, it would \neffectively impact how the Exchange manages its technology and hamper \nthe Exchange's ability to continue to invest in and fund access \nservices in a manner that allows it to meet existing and anticipated \naccess demands of market participants. Disapproval of fee changes such \nas the proposal herein, could also have the adverse effect of \ndiscouraging an exchange from improving its operations and implementing \ninnovative technology to the benefit of market participants if it \nbelieves the Commission would later prevent that exchange from \nrecouping costs and monetizing its operational enhancements, thus \nadversely impacting competition as well as the interests of market \nparticipants and investors.\n    Finally, the proposed fee is also the same as is concurrently being \nproposed for its Affiliate Exchanges. Further, Members are able to \nutilize a single port to connect to all of its Affiliate Exchanges and \nwill only be charged one single fee (i.e., a market participant will \nonly be assessed the proposed $8,500 even if it uses that physical port \nto connect to the Exchange and another (or even all 6) of its Affiliate \nExchanges. Particularly, the Exchange believes the proposed monthly per \nport fee is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly discriminatory since \nas the Exchange has determined to not charge multiple fees for the same \nport. Indeed, the Exchange notes that several ports are in fact \npurchased and utilized across one or more of the Exchange's affiliated \nExchanges (and charged only once).\n    The Exchange also believes that the proposed fee change is not \nunfairly discriminatory because it would be assessed uniformly across \nall market participants that purchase the physical ports. The Exchange \nbelieves increasing the fee for 10 Gb physical ports and charging a \nhigher fee as compared to the 1 Gb physical port is equitable as the 1 \nGb physical port is 1/10th the size of the 10 Gb physical port and \ntherefore does not offer access to many of the products and services \noffered by the Exchange (e.g., ability to receive certain market data \nproducts). Thus, the value of the 1 Gb alternative is lower than the \nvalue of the 10 Gb alternative, when measured based on the type of \nExchange access it offers. Moreover, market participants that purchase \n10 Gb physical ports utilize the most bandwidth and therefore consume \nthe most resources from the network. The Exchange also anticipates that \nfirms that utilize 10 Gb ports will benefit the most from the \nExchange's investment in offering NY6 as the Exchange anticipates there \nwill be much higher quantities of 10 Gb physical ports connecting from \nNY6 as compared to 1 Gb ports. Indeed, the Exchange notes that 10 Gb \nphysical ports account for approximately 90% of physical ports across \nthe NY4, NY5, and NY6 data centers, and to date, 80% of new port \nconnections in NY6 are 10 Gb ports. As such, the Exchange believes the \nproposed fee change for 10 Gb physical ports is reasonably and \nappropriately allocated.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose\n\n[[Page 22408]]\n\nany burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed fee change will \nnot impact intramarket competition because it will apply to all \nsimilarly situated Members equally (i.e., all market participants that \nchoose to purchase the 10 Gb physical port). Additionally, the Exchange \ndoes not believe its proposed pricing will impose a barrier to entry to \nsmaller participants and notes that its proposed connectivity pricing \nis associated with relative usage of the various market participants. \nFor example, market participants with modest capacity needs can \ncontinue to buy the less expensive 1 Gb physical port (which cost is \nnot changing) or may choose to obtain access via a third-party re-\nseller. While pricing may be increased for the larger capacity physical \nports, such options provide far more capacity and are purchased by \nthose that consume more resources from the network. Accordingly, the \nproposed connectivity fees do not favor certain categories of market \nparticipants in a manner that would impose a burden on competition; \nrather, the allocation reflects the network resources consumed by the \nvarious size of market participants--lowest bandwidth consuming members \npay the least, and highest bandwidth consuming members pays the most.\n    The proposed fee change also does not impose a burden on \ncompetition or on other Self-Regulatory Organizations that is not \nnecessary or appropriate. As described above, the Exchange evaluated \nits proposed fee change using objective and stable metric with limited \nvolatility. Utilizing Data Processing PPI over a specified period of \ntime is a reasonable means of recouping a portion of the Exchange's \ninvestment in maintaining and enhancing the connectivity service \nidentified above. The Exchange believes utilizing Data Processing PPI, \na tailored measure of inflation, to increase certain connectivity fees \nto recoup the Exchange's investment in maintaining and enhancing its \nservices and products would not impose a burden on competition.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\30\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\31\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission will institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or \ndisapproved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).\n    \\31\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to adopt fees for \nDedicated Cores. The text of the proposed rule change is provided in \nExhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (http://markets.cboe.com/us/\n\n[[Page 22409]]\n\nequities/regulation/rule_filings/edga/), at the Exchange's Office of \nthe Secretary, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to adopt fees for \nDedicated Cores.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange initially introduced Dedicated Cores and \ncorresponding pricing on March 1, 2024 (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-008). On \nMarch 20, 2024, the Exchange refiled the proposed fees (SR-CboeEDGA-\n2024-009). The Exchange amended the Dedicated Cores fees on April 1, \n2024 (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-012). On April 12, 2024, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGA2024-014. On May 13, \n2024, the Exchange withdrew SR-CboeEDGA-2024-009. On June 3, 2024, \nthe Exchange also withdrew SR-CboeEDGA-014 and SR-CboeEDGA-2024-020. \nOn August 1, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-\nCboeEDGA-2024-032. On business date September 30, 2024, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2024-039. On November \n26, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-\nCboeEDGA-2024-048. On January 24, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2025-001. On March 13, 2025, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2025-006. On \nMay 7, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted this \nfiling.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, the Exchange recently began to allow Users \n\\4\\ to assign a Single Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') logical order entry \nport \\5\\ to a single dedicated Central Processing Unit (CPU Core) \n(``Dedicated Core''). Historically, CPU Cores had been shared by \nlogical order entry ports (i.e., multiple logical ports from multiple \nfirms may connect to a single CPU Core). Use of Dedicated Cores \nhowever, can provide reduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved \nperformance since a firm using a Dedicated Core is utilizing the full \nprocessing power of a CPU Core instead of sharing that power with other \nfirms. This offering is completely voluntary and is available to all \nUsers that wish to purchase Dedicated Cores. Users may utilize BOE \nlogical order entry ports on shared CPU Cores, either in lieu of, or in \naddition to, their use of Dedicated Core(s). As such, Users are able to \noperate across a mix of shared and dedicated CPU Cores which the \nExchange believes provides additional risk and capacity management. \nFurther, Dedicated Cores are not required nor necessary to participate \non the Exchange and as such Users may opt not to use Dedicated Cores at \nall.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ A User may be either a Member or Sponsored Participant. The \nterm ``Member'' shall mean any registered broker or dealer that has \nbeen admitted to membership in the Exchange, limited liability \ncompany or other organization which is a registered broker or dealer \npursuant to Section 15 of the Act, and which has been approved by \nthe Exchange. A Sponsored Participant may be a Member or non-Member \nof the Exchange whose direct electronic access to the Exchange is \nauthorized by a Sponsoring Member subject to certain conditions. See \nExchange Rule 11.3.\n    \\5\\ Users may currently connect to the Exchange using a logical \nport available through an application programming interface \n(``API''), such as the Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') protocol. A BOE \nlogical order entry port is used for order entry.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to assess the following monthly fees for \nUsers that wish to use Dedicated Cores and adopt a maximum limit. \nFirst, the Exchange proposes to provide up to two Dedicated Cores to \nall Users who wish to use Dedicated Cores, at no additional cost. In \nthe event that a User voluntarily chooses to use more than two \nDedicated Cores, only then would the Exchange assess the following \nfees: $650 per Dedicated Core for 3-10 Dedicated Cores; $850 per \nDedicated Core for 11-15 Dedicated Cores; and $1,050 per Dedicated Core \nfor 16 or more Dedicated Cores. The proposed fees are progressive and \nthe Exchange proposes to include the following example in the Fees \nSchedule to provide clarity as to how the fees will be applied. \nParticularly, the Exchange will provide the following example: if a \nUser were to purchase 11 Dedicated Cores, it will be charged a total of \n$6,050 per month ($0 * 2) + ($650 * 8) + ($850 * 1). The Exchange also \nproposes to make clear in the Fees Schedule that the monthly fees are \nassessed and applied in their entirety and are not prorated. The \nExchange notes the current standard fees assessed for BOE Logical \nPorts, whether used with Dedicated or shared CPU cores, will remain \napplicable and unchanged.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ The Exchange currently assesses $550 per port per month. \nPort fees will also continue to be assessed on the first two \nDedicated Cores that Users receive at no additional cost. See Cboe \nEDGA Equities Fee Schedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Since the Exchange currently has a finite amount of physical space \nin its data centers in which its servers (and therefore corresponding \nCPU Cores) are located, the Exchange also proposes to prescribe a \nmaximum limit on the number of Dedicated Cores that Users may purchase \neach month. The purpose of establishing these limits is to manage the \nallotment of Dedicated Cores in a fair manner and to prevent the \nExchange from being required to expend large amounts of limited \nresources in order to provide an unlimited number of Dedicated Cores. \nThe Exchange previously established a limit for Members of a maximum \nnumber of 60 Dedicated Cores and Sponsoring Members a limit of a \nmaximum number of 25 Dedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access \nrelationships.\\7\\ The Exchange has since been able to procure \nadditional servers with CPU Cores and also has a better understanding \nof User demand relative to its available space and available Dedicated \nCores since the initial launch of Dedicated Cores. After seeing \nincreased User demand, the Exchange proposed to increase that cap and \nprovided that Members will be limited to a maximum number of 80 \nDedicated Cores and Sponsoring Members will be limited to a maximum \nnumber of 35 Dedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access \nrelationships.\\8\\ The Exchange noted at that time that it would \ncontinue monitoring Dedicated Core interest by all Users and allotment \navailability with the goal of increasing these limits to meet Users' \nneeds if and when the demand is there and/or the Exchange is able to \naccommodate additional Dedicated Cores. Since then, the Exchange has \ndetermined that it is able to accommodate an increased cap relative to \ncurrent demand. As such, the Exchange proposed to increase the cap to \n120 Dedicated Cores for Members, effective December 1, 2024.\\9\\ \nSponsoring Members will continue to be limited to a maximum of 35 \nDedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access relationships.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100300 (June 10, \n2024), 89 FR 50653 (June 14, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-020).\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101304 (October 10, \n2024), 89 FR 83748 (October 17, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-039).\n    \\9\\ The prescribed maximum quantity of Dedicated Cores for \nMembers applies regardless of whether that Member purchases the \nDedicated Cores directly from the Exchange and/or through a Service \nBureau. In a Service Bureau relationship, a customer allows its MPID \nto be used on the ports of a technology provider, or Service Bureau. \nOne MPID may be allowed on several different Service Bureaus.\n    \\10\\ The fee tier(s) applicable to Sponsoring Members are \ndetermined on a per Sponsored Access relationship basis and not on \nthe combined total of Dedicated Cores across Sponsored Users. For \nexample, under the proposed changes, a Sponsoring Member that has \nthree Sponsored Access relationships is entitled to a total of 105 \nDedicated Cores for those 3 Sponsored Access relationships but would \nbe assessed fees separately based on the 35 Dedicated Cores for each \nSponsored User (instead of combined total of 105 Dedicated Cores). \nFor example, a Sponsoring Member with 3 Sponsored Access \nrelationships would pay $30,450 per month if each Sponsored Access \nrelationship purchased the maximum 35 Dedicated Cores. More \nspecifically, the Sponsoring Member would be provided 2 Dedicated \nCores at no additional cost for each Sponsored User under Tier 1 \n(total of 6 Dedicated Cores at no additional cost) and provided an \nadditional 8 Dedicated Cores at $650 each for each Sponsored User, 5 \nDedicated Cores at $850 each for each Sponsored User and 20 \nDedicated Cores at $1,050 each for each Sponsored User (combined \ntotal of 99 additional Dedicated Cores).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22410]]\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\11\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\12\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\13\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) \\14\\ of the Act, which \nrequires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of \nreasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other \npersons using its facilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\12\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\13\\ Id.\n    \\14\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes the proposal is reasonable because the \nExchange is offering all Users who voluntarily choose to utilize \nDedicated Cores up to two Dedicated Cores at no additional cost. \nNotably, of the Members that currently maintain Dedicated Cores, 38% \nmaintain only 1 or 2 Dedicated Cores and therefore pay no additional \nfees. The Exchange believes the proposed fees are reasonable because \nDedicated Cores provide a valuable service in that it can provide \nreduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved performance compared \nto use of a shared CPU Core since a firm using a Dedicated Core is \nutilizing the full processing power of a CPU Core. The Exchange also \nemphasizes however, that the use of Dedicated Cores is not necessary \nfor trading and as noted above, is entirely optional. Users can also \ncontinue to access the Exchange through shared CPU Cores at no \nadditional cost. Indeed, only 36% of the Exchange's Members currently \nuse Dedicated Cores and as noted above, of those 36%, 38% take only 1 \nor 2 Dedicated Cores at no additional cost. Depending on a firm's \nspecific business needs, the proposal enables Users to choose to use \nDedicated Cores in lieu of, or in addition to, shared CPU Cores (or as \nemphasized, not use Dedicated Cores at all). If a User finds little \nbenefit in having Dedicated Cores based on its business model and \ntrading strategies, or determines Dedicated Cores are not cost-\nefficient for its needs or does not provide sufficient value to the \nfirm, such User may continue its use of the shared CPU Cores, \nunchanged. The Exchange is not aware of any specific reason \n(operational or otherwise) why a firm would not partake in the use of \nthe one to two free Dedicated Cores the Exchange offers. Indeed the \nExchange does not believe that the set up a firm would undertake to use \nfree Dedicated Cores offered by the Exchange is prohibitively difficult \nor burdensome; ultimately, whether or not a firm avails itself of the \nfree Dedicated Cores is a business decision, and some firms may decide \nthat the impact that Dedicated Cores may have is simply not beneficial \nor necessary to how that firm operates. The Exchange also has no plans \nto eliminate shared CPU Cores nor to require Users to purchase \nDedicated Cores.\n    The Exchange has seen general interest in Dedicated Cores from a \nvariety of market participants, with varying size and business models. \nSuch market participants include proprietary trading firms (who tend to \nbe more latency sensitive), as well as sell-side market participants \nand buy-side market participants (who tend to be less latency \nsensitive). For background, proprietary trading firms utilize their own \ncapital to trade without taking outside money from clients. Due to the \nnature of their respective businesses, the Exchange has classified \nproprietary trading firms as latency sensitive, and other groups, such \nas buy-side hedge funds, sell-side banks and sell-side non-banks (such \nas agency brokers) as non-latency sensitive. Proprietary trading firms' \nstrategies may range from, market making, to relative value trading and \narbitrage--these all rely on profiting from general market activity \nand, generally, requires faster entry and exit into trades and \npositions making proprietary trading firms more latency sensitive than \nother market segments. Buy-side hedge funds, banks and agency brokers \nare not as latency sensitive as, generally, the strategy for hedge \nfunds is based on overall long-term positioning in the market, and \nbanks and agency brokers may profit from commissions of customer order \nflow; both are generally strategies that are not reliant on speed to \nthe same extent proprietary trading firms are. Further, Users have \nvarious reasons for obtaining Dedicated Cores. Some Users for example, \nmay be seeking to further reduce latency or increase execution \ndeterminism, whereas others may use Dedicated Cores as a general risk \nmitigation by siloing their respective activity. For example, by using \nthe Dedicated Core(s) to silo its respective activity, a firm may be \nable to mitigate risk during periods of heightened volatility as the \nfirm will not need to compete for a shared resource (i.e., the shared \ncore). Of further note, only 68% of Members that are propriety trading \nfirms (who again, generally tend to be more latency sensitive) utilize \nDedicated Cores, and of that 68%, 40% are only utilizing the 1 to 2 \nfree Dedicated Cores available to all Users. As mentioned above, some \nnon-latency sensitive firms have chosen to also adopt Dedicated Cores. \n21% of Members that are not latency sensitive utilize Dedicated Cores, \nand of that 21%, 33% are only utilizing the 1 to 2 free Dedicated Cores \navailable to all Users.\n    The lack of universal, or even widespread, adoption by all such \nusers therefore demonstrates that purchasing Dedicated Cores is not \neffectively a requirement to compete for any one type of market \nparticipant, including latency sensitive market participants. Instead, \nDedicated Cores are an optional and voluntary connectivity offering, \nwhich market participants are free to choose whether or not to utilize \nbased on whether they meet their unique business needs. Moreover, the \nExchange has received overwhelming positive feedback and support for \nDedicated Cores from the firms that have chosen to utilize these in \nfurtherance of their respective needs, with some Users even noting that \nthey have moved more of their order flow to the Exchange and its \naffiliated equities exchanges (the\n\n[[Page 22411]]\n\n``Equities Exchanges'') as they have noticed both better fills and \ngreater consistency of order execution at the Equities Exchanges. This \ndemonstrates that despite any incurred costs for Users that choose to \npurchase Dedicated Cores, it is ultimately a net win for them as they \nbenefit from better execution. The Exchange believes it also \ndemonstrates that Users find the proposed fees to be both reasonable \nand have benefited from purchasing or, are alternatively benefiting \nfrom the proposed one or two free Dedicated Cores available at no \nadditional cost. The Exchange believes this is shown by both the level \nof demand for Dedicated Cores and the feedback from market participants \nthat have used the Dedicated Cores for its unique business needs, \nincluding as described above. The Exchange also believes it's notable \nthat no negative comment letters in connection with the proposed \npricing have been received since the Exchange first filed proposed fees \nfor Dedicated Cores back on March 1, 2024. Additionally, as noted \nearlier, Users can (and many have) decide that utilizing even a free \nDedicated Core is not needed for their business. The Exchange also \nnotes it has not received any feedback for Users that raise concerns \nover the barrier to entry to use Dedicated Cores, including notably the \nfree Dedicated Cores- nor is the Exchange aware of any reason why a \nfirm would ultimately choose not to use the free Dedicated Cores, other \nthan it is not necessary for its business. Ultimately, this is a \nbusiness decision that each User must make and is best suited to \ndetermine and will ultimately depend on the priorities and strategies \nof that User's respective business needs.\n    The Exchange also notes that at least one other exchange also has a \ncomparable offering.\\15\\ The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (``Nasdaq''), \nintroduced the Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure in 2014 \\16\\ which \nallows a member firm to assign up to 30 of its OUCH ports to a \ndedicated server infrastructure for its exclusive use.\\17\\ The \nDedicated OUCH server handles only the subscribing member firm's \nmessage traffic sent through their ports on the Dedicated OUCH to \nNasdaq's system.\\18\\ Similarly, as previously described, a Dedicated \nCore only handles that subscribing firm's messaging activity. Nasdaq \nnotes that with its Dedicated OUCH offering, member firms can develop a \ntailored solution by controlling their message traffic in order to \noptimize their trading strategies.\\19\\ As described above with \nDedicated Cores, one of the benefits is greater execution determinism \nas subscribers only need to account for their order flow when using a \nDedicated Core, similar to the existing Nasdaq Dedicated OUCH offering. \nIn addition to using Dedicated Cores and Dedicated OUCH for the purpose \nof greater execution determinism, firms may also use either offering \nfor greater risk mitigation as, with either offering, the subscribing \nfirm only needs to take their specific messaging traffic into account. \nNasdaq notes as well that its Dedicated OUCH offering is wholly \noptional and therefore member firms are not compelled to subscribe and \nthat its offering is pro-competitive as it adds an additional \nconnectivity option available to Nasdaq members.\\20\\ Similar to the \nDedicated OUCH offering, the Exchange has noted that no User is \nrequired to purchase or to use the two free Dedicated Cores offered to \nall Users.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market, Equity 7 Pricing Schedule, \nSection 115(g)(3), Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure.\n    \\16\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 70693 (October 16, \n2013), 78 FR 62761 (October 22, 2013) (SR-NASDAQ-2013-131).\n    \\17\\ See supra note 15.\n    \\18\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 70036 (July 25, \n2013), 78 FR 45993 (July 30, 2013) (SR-NASDAQ-2013-097).\n    \\19\\ Id.\n    \\20\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Despite these similarities, there are some differences. \nSpecifically, with the Nasdaq OUCH offering, a member firm would need \nto purchase an entire server, of which, 30 OUCH ports could be utilized \non the Dedicated OUCH server- a participant may purchase up to four \nDedicated OUCH servers based on its needs.\\21\\ In contrast, the \nExchange's offering allows for a purchase by cores (as opposed to an \nentire server), allowing a participant to more efficiently scale its \nbusiness by purchasing only the number of cores that it needs. \nUltimately, the Exchange's offering is more akin to a service offering \nwhile the Nasdaq offering is more akin to an infrastructure offering \n(and as such, the pricing structure does differ)--both offerings better \nenable a firm to utilize the full processing power of a CPU Core.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ See https://nasdaqtrader.com/\nTrader.aspx?id=OUCH#:~:text=Each%20server%20can%20house%20up%20to%20a\n%20maximum,Nasdaq%20Market%20Sales%20at%20%2B1%20800%20846%200477.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    A Dedicated OUCH Port Infrastructure subscription is available to a \nmember firm for a fee of $5,000 per month, which is in addition to the \nstandard fees assessed for each OUCH port. A one-time installation fee \nof $5,000 is assessed to subscribers for each Dedicated OUCH Port \nServer subscription.\\22\\ In contrast, the Exchange offers 1-2 Dedicated \nCores at no cost, making this widely available to any participant who \nmay find a benefit from using this offering. Additionally, by the \nExchange not charging an installation fee upfront, participants are \nable to try the offering at no cost, by receiving up to two Dedicated \nCores at no cost to the User. The Exchange's model allows for \nwidespread participation by all who wish to use Dedicated Cores--the \nsteep initial cost of Nasdaq's model of spending, at a minimum, $10,000 \nfor the first month requires a heavy investment, which in the case of \nsmaller participants, may not be feasible. In contrast, the Exchange's \nmodel of providing up to two Dedicated Cores at no cost, allows \nparticipants to easily utilize this service if they believe it is \nhelpful for their business needs. Moreover, the Exchange's service \noffering also provides more Users with more modest CPU capacity needs a \nzero-cost option, as well as the ability to buy only as many Dedicated \nCores that they need, whereas Nasdaq's Dedicated OUCH offering requires \na User to buy all cores offered on a single server (even if a firm does \nnot have the corresponding full amount of 30 ports), with no discounted \nor fee waiver for the first two cores, as well as no ability to buy \nfewer cores than necessary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market Rulebook, Equity 7 Pricing \nSchedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Lastly, the Exchange emphasizes that order processing itself is not \naffected by the introduction of Dedicated Cores. No relevant changes \nare intended to the matching engine, which is, and remains, the main \ncomponent of the Exchange's infrastructure being responsible for the \nactual processing of orders. While Users of Dedicated Cores may notice \na latency reduction, this is an inherent byproduct of introducing \nimproved technology.\\23\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ Moreover, there has been a longstanding history of \nexchanges providing enhanced technology where the latency reduction \nthat follows is a natural result. For example, other exchanges may \noffer a variety of co-location services where subscribers of these \nservices may benefit from lower latency based on the specific \noffering they choose based on their business needs. See e.g., The \nNasdaq Stock Market General 8 Connectivity, Section 1 Co-Location \nServices (demonstrating a range of cabinet offerings).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes that the proposed Dedicated Core fees \nare equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because they continue to \nbe assessed uniformly to similarly situated Users in that all Users who \nchoose to purchase Dedicated Cores will be subject to the same proposed \ntiered fee schedule. Moreover, all Users are entitled to up to 2 \nDedicated Cores at no additional cost and as previously\n\n[[Page 22412]]\n\ndiscussed, 38% of all Members that take Dedicated Cores (including both \nlatency sensitive and non-latency sensitive Members) take only 1 or 2 \nDedicated Cores at no additional cost. The Exchange believes the \nproposed ascending fee structure is also reasonable, equitable and not \nunfairly discriminatory as it is designed so that firms that use a \nhigher allotment of the Exchange's finite number of Dedicated Cores pay \nhigher rates, rather than placing that burden on market participants \nthat have more modest needs who will have the flexibility of obtaining \nDedicated Cores at lower price points in the lower tiers. As such, the \nproposed fees do not favor certain categories of market participants in \na manner that would impose a burden on competition; rather, the \nascending fee structure reflects the (finite) resources consumed by the \nvarious needs of market participants--that is, the lowest Dedicated \nCore consuming Users pay the least, and highest Dedicated Core \nconsuming Users pay the most. The Exchange believes that such pricing \nfurther creates a lower barrier to entry for all Users, making this \nservice widely available to all who deem it helpful for their business, \nincluding those with more modest needs. Other exchanges similarly \nassess higher fees to those that consume more Exchange resources.\\24\\ \nMoreover, those consuming more Dedicated Cores do so if they find a \nbenefit in having higher quantities of Dedicated Cores based on their \nrespective business needs. The proposed tier structure is also designed \nto encourage firms to manage their needs in a fair manner and to \nprevent the Exchange from being required to expend large amounts of \nlimited resources in order to provide an additional number of Dedicated \nCores or put the Exchange in a position that it cannot accommodate \ndemand. Moreover, as discussed above and in more detail below, the \nExchange cannot currently offer an unlimited number of Dedicated Cores \ndue in part to physical space constraints in the third-party data \ncenter. The Exchange believes the proposed ascending fee structure is \ntherefore another appropriate means, in conjunction with an established \ncap, to manage this finite resource and ensure the resource is \napportioned more fairly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ See e.g., Cboe U.S. Options Fees Schedule, BZX Options, \nOptions Logical Port Fees, Ports with Bulk Quoting Capabilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes it is reasonable to limit the number of \nDedicated Cores Users can purchase because the Exchange has a finite \namount of space in its third-party data centers to accommodate CPU \ncores, including Dedicated Cores. The Exchange must also take into \naccount timing and cost considerations in procuring additional \nDedicated Cores and related hardware such as servers, switches, optics \nand cables, as well as the readiness of the Exchange's data center \nspace to accommodate additional Dedicated Cores in the Exchange's \nrespective Order Handler Cabinets.\\25\\ Moreover, procuring data center \nspace has grown to be more challenging than it was five years ago with \nthe increased demand for data center space. For example, the U.S. \ncolocation data center market has doubled in size in just four years. \nIn addition to the Exchange's rollout of Dedicated Cores, the Exchange \nis mindful of its other business areas and the need to continue to be \nmindful of its existing, external restraints in procuring additional \nspace in this area. The Exchange has, and will continue to, monitor \nmarket participant demand and space availability and endeavor to adjust \nthe limit if and when the Exchange is able to acquire additional space \nand power within the third-party data centers and/or additional CPU \nCores to accommodate additional Dedicated Cores.\\26\\ The Exchange \nmonitors its capacity and data center space and thus is in the best \nplace to determine these limits and modify them as appropriate in \nresponse to changes to this capacity and space, as well as market \ndemand. Indeed, since the launch of Dedicated Cores on February 26, \n2024, the Exchange has already increased the prescribed maximum limit \nthree times not including the increase proposed herein, as a result of \nevaluating the demand relative to Dedicated Cores availability and \nprocuring additional physical space and CPU Cores.\\27\\ The proposed \nincreased limits continue to apply uniformly to similarly situated \nmarket participants (i.e., all Members are subject to the same limit \nand all Sponsored Participants are subject to the same limit, \nrespectively). The Exchange believes it's not unfairly discriminatory \nto provide for different limits for different types of Users. For \nexample, the Exchange believes it's not unfairly discriminatory to \nprovide for an initial lower limit to be allocated for Sponsored \nParticipants because unlike Members, Sponsored Participants are able to \naccess the Exchange without paying a Membership Fee. Members also have \nmore regulatory obligations and risk that Sponsored Participants do \nnot. For example, while Sponsored Participants must agree to comply \nwith the Rules of the Exchange, it is the Sponsoring Member of that \nSponsored Participant that remains ultimately responsible for all \norders entered on or through the Exchange by that Sponsored \nParticipant. The industry also has a history of applying fees \ndifferently to Members as compared to Sponsored Participants.\\28\\ \nLastly, the Exchange believes its proposed maximum limits, and \ndistinction between Members and Sponsored Participants, is another \nappropriate means to help the Exchange manage its allotment of \nDedicated Cores and better ensure this finite resource is apportioned \nfairly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ The Exchange notes that it cannot currently convert shared \nCPU cores into Dedicated Cores.\n    \\26\\ The Exchange does not have any Users that take Dedicated \nCores at or near the maximum limits and the average number of \nDedicated Cores used for the Exchange is 11.\n    \\27\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99983 (April 17, \n2024), 89 FR 30418 (April 23, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-014); \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 100300 (June 10, 2024), 89 FR \n50653 (June 14, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-020) and Securities Exchange \nAct Release No. 100736 (August 15, 2024), 89 FR 67696 (August 21, \n2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-032).\n    \\28\\ See e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 68342 \n(December 3, 2012), 77 FR 73096 (December 7, 2012) (SR-CBOE-2012-\n114) and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 66082 (January 3, \n2012), 77 FR 1101 (January 9, 2012) (SR-C2-2011-041).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act because the proposed tiered fee \nstructure will apply equally to all similarly situated Users that \nchoose to use Dedicated Cores. As discussed above, Dedicated Cores are \noptional and Users may choose to utilize Dedicated Cores, or not, based \non their views of the additional benefits and added value provided by \nutilizing a Dedicated Core. The Exchange believes the proposed fee will \nbe assessed proportionately to the potential value or benefit received \nby Users with a greater number of Dedicated Cores and notes that Users \nmay determine at any time to cease using Dedicated Cores. As discussed, \nUsers can also continue to access the Exchange through shared CPU Cores \nat no additional cost. Finally, all Users will be entitled to two \nDedicated Cores at no additional cost.\n    Next, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change does not \nimpose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or \nappropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously \ndiscussed, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market, \nincluding competition for exchange memberships. Market Participants \nhave numerous alternative venues that they\n\n[[Page 22413]]\n\nmay participate on, including 15 other equities exchanges, as well as \noff-exchange venues, where competitive products are available for \ntrading. Indeed, participants can readily choose to submit their order \nflow to other exchange and off-exchange venues if they deem fee levels \nat those other venues to be more favorable. Further, as described \nabove, Nasdaq also already provides a similar offering.\\29\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market, Equity 7 Pricing Schedule, \nSection 115(g)(3), Dedicated Ouch Port Infrastructure.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference \nfor competition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, \nproducts, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, in \nRegulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market \nforces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized \nthat current regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably \nsuccessful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that \nare most important to investors and listed companies.'' \\30\\ The fact \nthat this market is competitive has also long been recognized by the \ncourts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. \nCircuit stated as follows: ``[n]o one disputes that competition for \norder flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. \nnational market system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the \nbroker-dealers that act as their order-routing agents, have a wide \nrange of choices of where to route orders for execution'; [and] `no \nexchange can afford to take its market share percentages for granted' \nbecause `no exchange possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in \nthe execution of order flow from broker dealers'. . . .''.\\31\\ \nAccordingly, the Exchange does not believe its proposed change imposes \nany burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005).\n    \\31\\ NetCoalition v. SEC, 615 F.3d 525, 539 (D.C.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\32\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\33\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission will institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or \ndisapproved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).\n    \\33\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.

Introduction\n\n    On January 31, 2025, NYSE Arca, Inc.

On February 10, 2025, the Exchange filed \nAmendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, which replaced and \nsuperseded the original filing in its entirety. The proposed rule \nchange, as modified by Amendment No 1, was\n\n[[Page 22414]]\n\npublished for comment in the Federal Register on February 20, 2025.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n    \\3\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102416 (Feb. 13, \n2025), 90 FR 9985 (``Notice''). Comments received on the proposed \nrule change are available at: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2025-09/srnysearca202509.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2025-09/srnysearca202509.htm</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On March 11, 2025, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\\4\\ the \nCommission designated a longer period within which to approve the \nproposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute \nproceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule \nchange.\\5\\ This order institutes proceedings under Section 19(b)(2)(B) \nof the Act \\6\\ to determine whether to approve or disapprove the \nproposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).\n    \\5\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102582, 90 FR 12371 \n(Mar. 17, 2025). The Commission designated May 21, 2025, as the date \nby which the Commission shall approve or disapprove, or institute \nproceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule \nchange, as modified by Amendment No. 1.\n    \\6\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nII. Summary of the Proposal, as Modified by Amendment No. 1\n\n    As described in more detail in the Notice,\\7\\ the Exchange proposes \nto list and trade the Shares of the Trust under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E, \nwhich governs the listing and trading of Commodity-Based Trust Shares \non the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See Notice, supra note 3.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    According to the Exchange, the investment objective of the Trust is \nfor the value of the Shares to reflect the value of the Dogecoin \n(``DOGE'') held by the Trust,\\8\\ determined by reference to the ``Index \nPrice,'' less the Trust's expenses and other liabilities.\\9\\ The \n``Index Price'' is the U.S. dollar value of a DOGE derived from the \n``Digital Asset Trading Platforms'' \\10\\ that are reflected in the \nCoinDesk Dogecoin Price Index (DCX) (``Index''), calculated at 4:00 \np.m., New York time, on each business day.\\11\\ The Trust's assets will \nconsist solely of DOGE.\\12\\ The Trust creates and redeems Shares in \ncash with authorized participants on an ongoing basis in one or more \nblocks of 10,000 Shares.\\13\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ The Exchange states that DOGE is a digital asset that is \ncreated and transmitted through the operations of the peer-to-peer \nDogecoin Network, a decentralized network of computers that operates \non cryptographic protocols. See id. at 9987.\n    \\9\\ See id. at 9986. Grayscale Operating, LLC and Grayscale \nInvestments Sponsors, LLC are the sponsors of the Trust and are \nindirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group, Inc. \nThe Exchange states that as of May 3, 2025, Grayscale Operating, LLC \nwill cease to act as sponsor of the Trust and Grayscale Investment \nSponsors, LLC will be sole sponsor of the Trust. Delaware Trust \nCompany is the trustee of the Trust, and Coinbase Custody Trust \nCompany, LLC is the custodian for the Trust's DOGE. See id. at 9985.\n    \\10\\ According to the Exchange, a ``Digital Asset Trading \nPlatform'' is an electronic marketplace where trading participants \nmay trade, buy and sell DOGE based on bid-ask trading. See id. at \n9986 n.14.\n    \\11\\ See id. at 9986 n.10. The index provider for the Trust is \nCoinDesk Indices, Inc. See id. at 9987.\n    \\12\\ See id. at 9986.\n    \\13\\ See id. at 9995-96.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIII. Proceedings To Determine Whether To Approve or Disapprove SR-\nNYSEARCA-2025-09 and Grounds for Disapproval Under Consideration\n\n    The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section \n19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \\14\\ to determine whether the proposed rule \nchange, as modified by Amendment No. 1, should be approved or \ndisapproved. Institution of proceedings is appropriate at this time in \nview of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change. \nInstitution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has \nreached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. \nRather, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to \nprovide comments on the proposed rule change.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,\\15\\ the Commission is \nproviding notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. \nThe Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional \nanalysis of the proposed rule change's consistency with Section 6(b)(5) \nof the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a \nnational securities exchange be ``designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices'' and ``to protect investors and the \npublic interest.'' \\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ Id.\n    \\16\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the \nExchange's statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth \nin the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to \nsubmit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission \nseeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the \nTrust, which would hold DOGE, is designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not \npreviously contemplated by the Commission.\n\nIV. Procedure: Request for Written Comments\n\n    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written \nsubmissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the \nissues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have \nwith the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written \nviews of interested persons concerning whether the proposal, as \nmodified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) or any \nother provision of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. \nAlthough there do not appear to be any issues relevant to approval or \ndisapproval that would be facilitated by an oral presentation of views, \ndata, and arguments, the Commission will consider, pursuant to Rule \n19b-4, any request for an opportunity to make an oral presentation.\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the Securities \nActs Amendments of 1975, Public Law 94-29 (June 4, 1975), grants the \nCommission flexibility to determine what type of proceeding--either \noral or notice and opportunity for written comments--is appropriate \nfor consideration of a particular proposal by a self-regulatory \norganization. See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Senate Comm. \non Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st \nSess. 30 (1975).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and \narguments regarding whether the proposed rule change, as modified by \nAmendment No. 1, should be approved or disapproved by June 17, 2025. \nAny person who wishes to file a rebuttal to any other person's \nsubmission must file that rebuttal by July 1, 2025.\n    Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods:\n\nElectronic Comments\n\n    <bullet> Use the Commission's internet comment form (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml\">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml</a>); or\n    <bullet> Send an email to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#146661787139777b7979717a6067546771773a737b62\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"4a383f262f67292527272f243e390a392f29642d253c\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
