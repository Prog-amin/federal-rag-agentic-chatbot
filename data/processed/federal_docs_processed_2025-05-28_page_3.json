ONRR may not conduct or sponsor, and \nyou are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless \nit displays a currently valid OMB control number. As part of ONRR's \ncontinuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burdens, ONRR is \ninviting the public and other Federal agencies to comment on new, \nproposed, revised, and continuing collections of information in \naccordance with the PRA and 5 CFR 1320.8(d)(1). This helps ONRR to \nassess the impact of its information collection requirements and \nminimize the public's reporting burden. It also helps the public \nunderstand ONRR's information collection requirements and provide the \nrequested data in the desired format.\n    ONRR is especially interested in public comments addressing the \nfollowing:\n    (1) Whether or not the collection of information is necessary for \nthe proper performance of the functions of the agency, including \nwhether or not the information will have practical utility;\n    (2) The accuracy of ONRR's estimate of the burden for this \ncollection of information, including the validity of the methodology \nand assumptions used;\n    (3) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the \ninformation to be collected; and\n    (4) How might the agency minimize the burden of the collection of \ninformation on those who are to respond, including through the use of \nappropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological \ncollection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., \npermitting electronic submission of response.\n    ONRR published a notice, with a 60-day public comment period, \nsoliciting\n\n[[Page 22112]]\n\ncomments on this collection of information in the Federal Register on \nNovember 18, 2024 (89 FR 90734). ONRR did not receive comments from \ncompanies in response to the published 60-day Federal Register notice.\n    Comments that you submit in response to this 30-day notice are a \nmatter of public record. ONRR will include or summarize each comment in \nits request to OMB to approve this ICR. Before including your address, \nphone number, email address, or other personal identifying information \nin your comment, you should be aware that your entire comment--\nincluding your personally identifying information--may be made publicly \navailable at any time. While you can ask ONRR in your comment to \nwithhold your personally identifying information from public review, \nONRR cannot guarantee that it will be able to do so.\n    Abstract: (a) General Information: The Secretary of the Interior \n(``Secretary'') is responsible for mineral resource development on \nFederal and Indian lands and the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. Laws \npertaining to Federal and Indian mineral leases are posted at <a href=\"https://onrr.gov/references/statutes\">https://onrr.gov/references/statutes</a>. Pursuant to the Federal Oil and Gas \nRoyalty Management Act of 1982 (``FOGRMA'') and other laws, the \nSecretary's responsibilities include maintaining a comprehensive \ninspection, collection, and fiscal and production accounting and \nauditing system that: (1) accurately determines mineral royalties, \ninterest, and other payments owed, (2) collects and accounts for such \namounts in a timely manner, and (3) disburses the funds collected. See \n30 U.S.C. 1701 and 1711. ONRR performs these royalty and revenue \nmanagement responsibilities for the Secretary. See Secretary's Order \nNo. 3306.\n    The information collections that ONRR covers in this ICR are found \nat 30 CFR part 1202, subparts C and J, which pertain to Indian oil and \ngas royalties; part 1206, subparts B and E, which govern the valuation \nof oil and gas produced from leases on Indian lands; and part 1207, \nwhich pertains to recordkeeping. Indian Tribes and allottees receive \nall royalties generated from their lands. Determining product valuation \nis essential to ensure that Indian Tribes and allottees receive payment \non the full value of the minerals removed from their lands.\n    (b) Information Collections: This ICR covers the paperwork \nrequirements under 30 CFR parts 1202, 1206, and 1207 as follows:\n    (1) Indian Oil--Regulations at 30 CFR part 1206, subpart B, govern \nthe valuation for royalty purposes of oil produced from Indian oil and \ngas leases (Tribal and allotted). These regulations require a lessee to \nfile form ONRR-4110, Oil Transportation Allowance Report, when its oil \ntransportation allowance includes costs incurred under non-arm's-length \nor no-contract transportation situations. ONRR and Tribal audit \npersonnel use the information collected on this form to help verify \nthat the lessee correctly reported its transportation allowance within \nregulatory allowance limitations and reported and paid the correct \namount of royalties.\n    (2) Indian Gas--Regulations at 30 CFR part 1206, subpart E, govern \nthe valuation for royalty purposes of natural gas produced from Indian \noil and gas leases (Tribal and allotted). These regulations require \nreporting on ONRR forms 4109, 4295, 4410, and 4411 as follows:\n    (a) A lessee must file form ONRR-4109, Gas Processing Allowance \nReport, when its processing allowance includes costs incurred under \nnon-arm's-length or no-contract processing situations. ONRR and Tribal \naudit personnel use the information collected on this form to verify \nthat the lessee correctly reported its processing allowance within \nregulatory allowance limitations and reported and paid the correct \namount of royalties.\n    (b) A lessee must file form ONRR-4295, Gas Transportation Allowance \nReport, when its gas transportation allowance includes costs incurred \nunder non-arm's-length or no-contract transportation situations. ONRR \nand Tribal audit personnel use the information collected on this form \nto verify that a lessee correctly reported its transportation allowance \nwithin regulatory allowance limitations and reported and paid the \ncorrect amount of royalties.\n    (c) A lessee for an Indian oil and gas lease must file form ONRR-\n4410, Accounting for Comparison [Dual Accounting] to certify when dual \naccounting is not required (part A) or to make an election for actual \ndual accounting as defined in 30 CFR 1206.176 or alternative dual \naccounting as defined in 30 CFR 1206.173 when dual accounting is \nrequired (part B).\n    (d) A lessee uses form ONRR-4411, Safety Net Report, when it sells \ngas production from an Indian oil or gas lease in an ONRR-designated \nindex zone beyond the first index pricing point. The safety net \ncalculation establishes the minimum value, for royalty purposes, of \nnatural gas production from Indian oil and gas leases. This reporting \nhelps ensure that Indian lessors receive all royalties due and aids \nONRR's compliance efforts.\n    (3) Indian Oil and Gas--Regulations at 30 CFR 1206.56(b)(2) and \n1206.177(c)(2) and (c)(3) provide that a lessee must submit form ONRR-\n4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation, as part of a \nvalid request to exceed the regulatory allowance limit of 50 percent of \nroyalty value for transportation allowances. OMB approved the form \nONRR-4393 under OMB Control Number 1012-0005, which otherwise pertains \nto Federal oil and gas leases. This form provides ONRR with the \nnecessary data to make a decision on whether to approve or deny the \nrequest.\n    The requirement to report is mandatory for form ONRR-4410 and, \nunder certain circumstances, form ONRR-4411. To obtain certain \nbenefits, a lessee must file forms ONRR-4109, ONRR-4110, ONRR-4295, and \nONRR-4393.\n    Title of Collection: Indian Oil and Gas Valuation.\n    OMB Control Number: 1012-0002.\n    Bureau Form Number: Forms ONRR-4109, ONRR-4110, ONRR-4295, ONRR-\n4393, ONRR-4410, and ONRR-4411.\n    Type of Review: Extension of a currently approved collection.\n    Respondents/Affected Public: Businesses.\n    Total Estimated Number of Annual Respondents: 146 Indian lessees.\n    Total Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 146.\n    Estimated Completion Time per Response: 8.85 hours.\n    Total Estimated Number of Annual Burden Hours: 1,299 hours.\n    Respondent's Obligation: Required to obtain or retain a benefit.\n    Frequency of Collection: Annual and on occasion.\n    Total Estimated Annual Non-Hour Burden Cost: ONRR identified no \n``non-hour cost'' burden associated with this collection of \ninformation.\n    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required \nto respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a \ncurrently valid OMB control number.\n    The authority for this action is the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.).\n\nApril Lockler,\nActing Director, Office of Natural Resources Revenue.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09266 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4335-30-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Introduction\n\n    On January 29, 2025, NYSE Arca, Inc. (``Exchange'' or ``NYSE \nArca'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 (``Act'' or ``Exchange Act'') \\1\\ and Rule 19b-4 \nthereunder,\\2\\ a proposed rule change to amend rules regarding the \nposition and exercise limits for options on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust \nand to permit Flexible Exchange Options on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. \nOn February 7, 2025, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed \nrule change. The proposed rule change, as amended, was published for \ncomment in the Federal Register on February 18, 2025.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n    \\3\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102402 (Feb. 11, \n2025), 90 FR 9765.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On March 12, 2025, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\\4\\ the \nCommission designated a longer period within which to approve the \nproposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute \nproceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule \nchange.\\5\\ The Commission has received no comments on the proposed rule \nchange, as modified by Amendment No. 1. On April 28, 2025, the Exchange \nfiled Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change (``Amendment No. \n2''). On May 6, 2025, the Exchange withdrew Amendment No. 2 and filed \nAmendment No. 3 to the proposed rule change (``Amendment No. 3''), as \ndescribed in Items II and III below, which Items have been prepared by \nthe Exchange.\\6\\ The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit \ncomments on the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 3, \nand is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the \nAct \\7\\ to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule \nchange, as modified by Amendment No. 3.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).\n    \\5\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102629, 90 FR 12630 \n(Mar. 18, 2025). The Commission designated May 19, 2025, as the date \nby which the Commission shall approve or disapprove, or institute \nproceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule \nchange.\n    \\6\\ Amendment No. 3 is available at: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2025-07/srnysearca202507-598415-1738062.pdf\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2025-07/srnysearca202507-598415-1738062.pdf</a>.\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Description of the Proposed Rule \nChange, as Modified by Amendment No. 3\n\n    The Exchange proposes to certain [sic] rules that restrict the \nposition and exercise limits for options on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust \nETF (``GBTC'') and to permit Flexible Exchange (``FLEX'') Options on \nGBTC. This Amendment No. 3 supersedes and replaces the original filing \nin its entirety.\\8\\ The proposed rule change is\n\n[[Page 22121]]\n\navailable on the Exchange's website at <a href=\"http://www.nyse.com\">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal \noffice of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ On February 7, 2025, the Exchange submitted partial \nAmendment No.1 to its proposal to make certain technical changes to \nthe Exhibit 5 (the ``original filing''). See Securities Exchange Act \nRelease No. 102629 (February 11, 2025), 90 FR 12630 (February 18, \n2025) (SR-NYSEARCA-2025-07). On April 28, 2025, the Exchange filed \nAmendment No. 2, which was withdrawn on May 6, 2025. This Amendment \nNo. 3 modifies the original filing to make clarifying changes to the \nPurpose section to reflect that the proposed position and exercise \nlimits for options on GBTC will be the same as the position and \nexercise limits for other equity options (i.e., not a fixed limit of \n25,000 contracts) and that any FLEX and non-FLEX positions in GBTC \noptions must be aggregated for purposes of calculating position and \nexercise limits for such options, which changes more closely align \nwith the rule text in the Exhibit 5. The Exchange also proposes a \ntechnical change to replace rule text references to ``the Grayscale \nBitcoin Trust BTC (BTC)'' with its ticker symbol, ``GBTC''.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend certain rules that restrict the \nposition and exercise limits for options on GBTC and to permit GBTC \noptions to trade as FLEX Equity Options (``FLEX GBTC'') as described \nherein. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to (1) amend Commentary \n.06(f) to Rule 6.8-O (Position Limits) to remove the 25,000-contract \nposition limit on GBTC options thus allowing such limits to be \nincreased; \\9\\ and (2) amend Rules 5.32-O(f)(1) (Terms of FLEX) and \n5.36-O(b) (Position Limits) to permit FLEX GBTC options and to require \nthe aggregation of any FLEX and non-FLEX positions for purposes of \ncalculating position and exercise limits for GBTC.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ As discussed herein, the removal of GBTC (and associated \n25,000-contact limit) from Commentary .06(f) means the position \nlimit for GBTC options will be determined based on trading in GBTC \nduring the most recent six-month period. See Rule 6.8-O, Commentary \n.06(a)-(e). As discussed herein, GBTC options currently qualify for \nposition (and exercise) limits of 250,000 contracts per Rule 6.8-O, \nCommentary .06(e)(i).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes that this proposal is competitive given that \nNasdaq ISE, LLC (``ISE'') recently filed a proposal to remove the \n25,000-contract position and exercise limits applicable to options on \nthe iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (``IBIT'').\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See Amendment No 2 to Proposed Rule Change to modify the \nposition and exercise limits for IBIT options to the applicable \nposition and exercise limits as determined by Options 9, Sections 13 \nand 15 (SR-ISE-2024-62), filed Mar. 26, 2025, available at <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-ise-2024-62/srise202462-593575-1721782.pdf\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-ise-2024-62/srise202462-593575-1721782.pdf</a>. \n(``ISE IBIT Proposal''). Like GBTC, IBIT is an ETF that holds \nbitcoin.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBackground\n    GBTC is an ETF that holds bitcoin and is listed on the \nExchange.\\11\\ On October 18, 2024, the Commission approved the listing \nand trading of GBTC options on NYSE American, LLC (``NYSE \nAmerican'').\\12\\ On November 22, 2024, the Exchange obtained rule \nauthority to trade GBTC options.\\13\\ The position (and exercise) \\14\\ \nlimits for GBTC options are 25,000 contracts, as set forth in Rule 6.8-\nO, Commentary .06(f), the lowest limit available in options.\\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ NYSE Arca received approval to list and trade Bitcoin-Based \nCommodity-Based Trust Shares in GBTC pursuant to NYSE Arca Rule \n8.201-E(c)(1). See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99306 \n(January 10, 2024), 89 FR 3008 (January 17, 2024) (Order Granting \nAccelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes, as Modified by \nAmendments Thereto, to list and trade options on, among other ETFs, \nGBTC) (SR-NYSEARCA-2021-90).\n    \\12\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101386 (October 18, \n2024), 89 FR 84960 (October 24, 2024) (SR-NYSEAMER-2024-49) (order \napproving rules to permit the listing and trading of GBTC options, \namong others) (the ``GBTC Options Approval Order'').\n    \\13\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101713 (November \n22, 2024), 89 FR 94839 (November 29, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-2024-101) \n(notice of immediately effective rule change to permit GBTC options \ntrading, based on the already-approved NYSE American rules) (the \n``Arca GBTC Options Notice'').\n    \\14\\ The Exchange notes that the exercise limit for GBTC options \nare based on, and are always the same as, the position limit for \nsuch options. See Rule 6.9-O (Exercise Limits).\n    \\15\\ Pursuant to Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .06(f), options on the \nfollowing ETFs--all of which, like GBTC, hold bitcoin--are also \nsubject to a 25,000-contract position and exercise limit: IBIT, the \nGrayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC (``BTC''), the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF \n(``BITB''), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (``FBTC''), and \nthe ARK 21Shares Bitcoin (``ARKB'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    FLEX Equity Options are not generally subject to position (or \nexercise) limits.\\16\\ Today, pursuant to Rule 5.32-O(f)(1), GBTC \noptions are not approved for FLEX trading.\\17\\ Therefore, the 25,000-\ncontract limit for GBTC options currently applies solely to non-FLEX \nGBTC options.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ See Rule 5.35-O(b) (subject to the exceptions enumerated in \nthe rule ``there shall be no position limits'' for FLEX Equity \nOptions).\n    \\17\\ Pursuant to Rule 5.32-O(f)(1), FLEX trading is also not \navailable for options on IBIT, BTC, BITB, FBTC, and ARKB.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Per the Commission, ``rules regarding position and exercise limits \nare intended to prevent the establishment of options positions that can \nbe used or might create incentives to manipulate or disrupt the \nunderlying market so as to benefit the options positions.'' \\18\\ For \nthis reason, the Commission requires that ``position and exercise \nlimits must be sufficient to prevent investors from disrupting the \nmarket for the underlying security by acquiring and exercising a number \nof options contracts disproportionate to the deliverable supply and \naverage trading volume of the underlying security.'' \\19\\ Based on its \nreview of the data and analysis provided by NYSE American, the \nCommission concluded that the proposed 25,000-contract position and \nexercise limits for GBTC options satisfied these objectives.\\20\\ The \nExchange adopted the already-approved 25,000-contract limit for GBTC \noptions.\\21\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See GBTC Options Approval Order, 89 FR at 84971.\n    \\19\\ See id.\n    \\20\\ See id.\n    \\21\\ See Arca GBTC Options Notice, 89 FR at 94842. See also Rule \n6.8-O, Commentary .06(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosition Limits\n    While NYSE American proposed an aggregated 25,000 contract position \n(and exercise) limit for GBTC options, it nonetheless believed that \nevidence existed to support a much higher position limit.\\22\\ \nSpecifically, in approving GBTC options trading on NYSE American, the \nCommission considered and reviewed NYSE American's analysis that the \nexercisable risk associated with a position (and exercise) limit of \n25,000 contracts represented only 0.9% of the outstanding shares of \nGBTC.\\23\\ The Commission also considered and reviewed NYSE American's \narguments that with a 25,000-contract limit, and 284,570,100 GBTC \nshares outstanding, 114 market participants would have to \nsimultaneously exercise their positions to place GBTC under stress.\\24\\ \nBased on the Commission's review of this information and analysis, the \nCommission concluded that the proposed position and exercise limits of \n25,000 contracts were designed to prevent investors from disrupting the \nmarket for the underlying security by acquiring and exercising a number \nof options contracts disproportionate to the deliverable supply and \naverage trading volume of the underlying security, and to prevent the \nestablishment of options positions that can be used or might create \nincentives to manipulate or disrupt the underlying\n\n[[Page 22122]]\n\nmarket so as to benefit the options position.\\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ See GBTC Options Approval Order, 89 FR, at 84970 (referring \nto NYSE American's argument that, as of Sept. 30, 2024, GBTC traded \n723,758,100 shares in the most recent six months of trading, which \nwould qualify GBTC for a 250,000-contract position limit per NYSE \nAmerican Rule 904, Commentary .07(a), which is identical to Arca \nRule 6.8-O Commentary .06(e)).\n    \\23\\ See id. Data represents figures from FactSet as of August \n30, 2024.\n    \\24\\ See GBTC Options Approval Order, 89 FR at 84971.\n    \\25\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    GBTC currently qualifies for a 250,000-limit on same-side contracts \npursuant to Rule 6.8-O Commentary .06(e)(i), which requires that \ntrading volume for the underlying security in the most recent six \nmonths be at least 100,000,000 shares.\\26\\ As of November 25, 2024, \nduring the most recent six-month period, trading volume for GBTC was \n550,687,400 shares. In addition, as of November 25, 2024, the market \ncapitalization for GBTC was $20,661,316,542,\\27\\ with an average daily \nvolume (``ADV'') for the preceding three months of 3,829,597 shares. \nGBTC is well above the requisite minimum of 100,000,000 shares \nnecessary to qualify for the 250,000-contract position and exercise \nlimit. Also, as of November 25, 2024, there were 19,787,762 bitcoins in \ncirculation.\\28\\ At a price of $94,830 per bitcoin,\\29\\ that equates to \na market capitalization of greater than $1.876 trillion. If an \naggregated position and exercise limit of 250,000 contracts were \nconsidered, the exercisable risk would represent 9.13% \\30\\ of GBTC \nshares outstanding. Given GBTC's liquidity, the current 25,000-contract \nposition (and exercise) limit is extremely conservative.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\26\\ See Rule 6.8-O Commentary .06(e) (providing at subparagraph \n(e) that the position limit shall be 250,000 contracts for options: \n(i) on underlying stock or Exchange-Traded Fund Share that had \ntrading volume of at least 100,000,000 shares during the most recent \nsix-month trading period; or (ii) on an underlying stock or \nExchange-Traded Fund Share that had trading volume of at least \n75,000,000 shares during the most recent six-month trading period \nand has at least 300,000,000 shares currently outstanding).\n    \\27\\ The market capitalization of GBTC was determined by \nmultiplying a settlement price ($75.42) by the number of shares \noutstanding (273,950,100). Data represents figures from FactSet as \nof November 25, 2024.\n    \\28\\ See <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin</a>.\n    \\29\\ This is the approximate price of bitcoin from 4 p.m. ET on \nNovember 25, 2024.\n    \\30\\ This percentage is arrived at with this equation: (250,000 \ncontract limit * 100 shares per option/273,950.100 shares \noutstanding).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As noted above, position and exercise limits are designed to limit \nthe number of options contracts traded on an exchange in an underlying \nsecurity that an investor, acting alone or in concert with others \ndirectly or indirectly, may control. These limits, which are described \nin Rules 6.8-O and 6.9-O, are intended to address potential \nmanipulative schemes and adverse market impacts surrounding the use of \noptions, such as disrupting the market in the security underlying the \noptions. Position and exercise limits must balance concerns regarding \nmitigating potential manipulation and the cost of inhibiting potential \nhedging activity that could be used for legitimate economic purposes.\n    To achieve this balance, the Exchange proposes to remove GBTC (and \nthe associated 25,000-contract limit) from Commentary .06(f), which \nwould enable GBTC options to trade in the same manner as options on \nother ETFs not included in this Commentary.\\31\\ Specifically, this \nproposal would result in an increased position (and exercise) limit for \nGBTC options from 25,000 to 250,000 same-side contacts, pursuant to \nCommentary .06(e)(i). In addition, like options on other ETFs not \nlisted in Commentary .06(f), position limits for GBTC options would be \nsubject to subsequent six (6) month reviews to determine future \nposition (and exercise) limits.\\32\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\31\\ See proposed Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .06(f). The Exchange \nnotes that the ETFs included in Commentary .06(f) (other than ETFs \nlike GBTC that hold bitcoin) have significantly higher position \nlimits than are authorized by Rule, which increases were subject to \nExchange rule filings.\n    \\32\\ See Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .06(e) (providing that, every \nsix months, the Exchange will review the volume and outstanding \nshare information on all underlying ETFs on which options are traded \nmonths to determine applicable position limits). See also Rule 6.9-O \n(providing that exercise limits for options on an underlying will be \nthe same as the position limits for such underlying).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In addition to determining GBTC's eligibility for a 250,000-\ncontract position (and exercise) limit per Commentary .06(e)(i), the \nExchange performed additional analyses regarding GBTC in support of \nthis proposal. First, the Exchange reviewed GBTC's data relative to the \nmarket capitalization of the entire bitcoin market in terms of exercise \nrisk and availability of deliverables. As noted above, as of November \n25, 2024, there were 19,787,762 bitcoins in circulation.\\33\\ At a price \nof $94,830 per bitcoin,\\34\\ that equates to a market capitalization of \ngreater than $1.876 trillion. If an aggregated position (and exercise) \nlimit of 250,000 contracts were considered, the exercisable risk would \nrepresent 9.13% \\35\\ of the outstanding shares outstanding of GBTC. \nSince GBTC has a creation and redemption process managed through the \nissuer (whereby bitcoin is used to create GBTC shares), the position \nlimit can be compared to the total market capitalization of the entire \nbitcoin market, and in that case, the exercisable risk for options on \nGBTC would represent less than 0.10% of all bitcoin outstanding.\\36\\ \nThe Exchange notes that if GBTC options were subject to a 250,000-\ncontract position and exercise limit (based on GBTC trading volume) and \nif all options on GBTC shares were exercised at once, this occurrence \nwould have a virtually unnoticed impact on the entire bitcoin market. \nThis analysis demonstrates that a 250,000-contract position (and \nexercise) limit for GBTC options would be appropriate given GBTC's \nliquidity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\33\\ See <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin</a>.\n    \\34\\ This is the approximate price of bitcoin from 4 p.m. ET on \nNovember 25, 2024.\n    \\35\\ This percentage is arrived at with this equation: (250,000 \ncontract limit * 100 shares per option/273,950,100 shares \noutstanding).\n    \\36\\ This number was arrived at with this calculation: ((250,000 \nlimit * 100 shares per option * $75.42 settle)/(19,787,762 BTC \noutstanding * $94,830 BTC price)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Next, the Exchange reviewed the proposed position limit by \ncomparing it to position limits for derivative products regulated by \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''). While the CFTC, \nthrough the relevant Designated Contract Markets, only regulates \noptions positions based upon delta equivalents (creating a less \nstringent standard), the Exchange examined equivalent bitcoin futures \nposition limits. In particular, the Exchange looked to the Chicago \nMercantile Exchange (``CME'') bitcoin futures contract,\\37\\ which has a \nposition limit of 2,000 futures (for the initial spot month).\\38\\ On \nOctober 22, 2024, CME bitcoin futures settled at $94,945.\\39\\ On \nOctober 22, 2024, GBTC settled at $53.64, which would equate to greater \nthan 17,700,410 shares of GBTC if the CME notional position limit was \nutilized. Since substantial portions of any distributed options \nportfolio are likely to be out of the money on expiration, an options \nposition limit equivalent to the CME position limit for bitcoin futures \n(considering that all options deltas are <=1.00) should be a bit higher \nthan the CME implied limit of 177,004.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\37\\ CME Bitcoin Futures are described in Chapter 350 of CME's \nRulebook.\n    \\38\\ See the Position Accountability and Reportable Level Table \nin the Interpretations & Special Notices Section of Chapter 5 of \nCME's Rulebook. Each CME bitcoin futures contract is valued at five \nbitcoins as defined by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (``BRR''). \nSee CME Rule 35001.\n    \\39\\ 2,000 futures at a 5-bitcoin multiplier (per the contract \nspecifications) equates to $949,450,000 (2000 contracts * 5 BTC per \ncontract * $94,945 price of November BTC future) of notional value.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Of note, unlike options contracts, CME position limits are \ncalculated on a net futures-equivalent basis by contract and include \ncontracts that aggregate into one or more base contracts according to \nan aggregation ratio(s).\\40\\ Therefore, if a portfolio includes \npositions in options on futures, CME would aggregate those\n\n[[Page 22123]]\n\npositions into the underlying futures contracts in accordance with a \ntable published by CME on a delta equivalent value for the relevant \nspot month, subsequent spot month, single month and all month position \nlimits.\\41\\ If a position exceeds position limits because of an option \nassignment, CME permits market participants to liquidate the excess \nposition within one business day without being considered in violation \nof its rules. Additionally, if at the close of trading, a position that \nincludes options exceeds position limits for futures contracts, when \nevaluated using the delta factors as of that day's close of trading but \ndoes not exceed the limits when evaluated using the previous day's \ndelta factors, then the position shall not constitute a position limit \nviolation. Considering CME's position limits on bitcoin futures, the \nExchange believes a 250,000-contract limit for GBTC options would be \nappropriate.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\40\\ See <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/market-regulation/position-limits/position-limits-aggregation-of-contracts-and-table.htm\">https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/market-regulation/position-limits/position-limits-aggregation-of-contracts-and-table.htm</a>.\n    \\41\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Finally, the Exchange analyzed a position and exercise limit of \n250,000 for GBTC against options on SPDR Gold Shares (``GLD''), which \n(like GBTC), is a commodity-backed ETF.\\42\\ The Exchange notes that GLD \nhas a float of 306.1 million shares and a position limit of 250,000 \ncontracts.\\43\\ As previously noted, position and exercise limits are \ndesigned to limit the number of options contracts traded on the \nexchange in an underlying security that an investor, acting alone or in \nconcert with others directly or indirectly, may control. A position \nlimit exercise in GLD would represent 8.17% of the float of GLD. In \ncomparison, a 250,000-contract position limit in GBTC would represent \n9.13% of the float of GBTC. . [sic] While less conservative than the \nstandard applied to options on GLD, the Exchange nonetheless believes \nthat subjecting GBTC options to a 250,000-contract position and \nexercise limit would be appropriate.\\44\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\42\\ GLD, like GBTC, holds one asset in trust.\n    \\43\\ See <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-gold-shares-gld\">https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-gold-shares-gld</a>.\n    \\44\\ See, e.g., Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .06(e) (setting forth \ntrading volume requirements to qualify for a 250,000-contract \nposition (and exercise) limit).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Based on the foregoing, the Exchange believes that it has \ndemonstrated that GBTC has more than sufficient liquidity to garner an \nincreased position and exercise limit of 250,000 same-side contracts. \nThe Exchange believes that the significant liquidity present in GBTC \nmitigates against the potential for manipulation.\n    The Exchange believes that allowing GBTC options to have increased \naggregated position and exercise limits would lead to a more liquid and \ncompetitive market environment for such options, which will benefit \ncustomers that trade these options. Further, the reporting requirement \nfor such options would remain unchanged. Thus, the Exchange will still \nrequire that each member that maintains positions in GBTC options on \nthe same side of the market, for its own account or for the account of \na customer, report certain information to the Exchange. This \ninformation includes, but would not be limited to, the options \npositions, whether such positions are hedged and, if so, a description \nof the hedge(s). Market Makers \\45\\ would continue to be exempt from \nthis reporting requirement, however, the Exchange may access Market \nMaker position information.\\46\\ Moreover, the Exchange's requirement \nthat members file reports with the Exchange for any customer who held \naggregate large long or short positions on the same side of the market \nof 200 or more option contracts of any single class for the previous \nday will remain at this level.\\47\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\45\\ Per Rule 6.32-O(a), a Market Maker is an individual who is \nregistered with the Exchange for the purpose of making transactions \nas a dealer-specialist.\n    \\46\\ The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') through the \nLarge option Position Reporting (``LOPR'') system acts as a \ncentralized service provider for OTP Holder compliance with position \nreporting requirements by collecting data from each OTP Holder or \nOTP Firm, consolidating the information, and ultimately providing \ndetailed listings of each TPH's report to the Exchange, as well as \nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (``FINRA''), acting as \nits agent pursuant to a regulatory services agreement (``RSA'').\n    \\47\\ See Rule 6.6-O. Reporting of Options Positions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also has no reason to believe that the growth in \ntrading volume in GBTC options will not continue. Rather, the Exchange \nexpects continued options volume growth in GBTC as opportunities for \ninvestors to participate in the options markets increase and evolve. \nThe Exchange believes that the current position and exercise limits in \nGBTC options are restrictive and will hamper the listed options markets \nfrom being able to compete fairly and effectively with the over-the-\ncounter (``OTC'') markets. OTC transactions occur through bilateral \nagreements, the terms of which are not publicly disclosed to the \nmarketplace. As such, OTC transactions do not contribute to the price \ndiscovery process on a public exchange or other lit markets. The \nExchange believes that without the proposed changes to position and \nexercise limits for GBTC options, market participants will find the \n25,000-contract position limit an impediment to their business and \ninvestment objectives as well as an impediment to efficient pricing. As \na result, market participants may find the less transparent OTC markets \na more attractive alternative to achieve their investment and hedging \nobjectives, leading to a retreat from the listed options markets, where \ntrades are subject to reporting requirements and daily surveillance.\n    The Exchange believes that the existing surveillance procedures and \nreporting requirements at the Exchange are capable of properly \nidentifying disruptive and/or manipulative trading activity. The \nExchange also represents that it has adequate surveillances in place to \ndetect potential manipulation, as well as reviews in place to identify \ncontinued compliance with the Exchange's listing standards. These \nprocedures monitor market activity to identify unusual activity in both \noptions and the underlying equities.\nFLEX GBTC Options\n    The Exchange also proposes to permit FLEX GBTC options and would \nrequire the aggregation of any FLEX and non-FLEX positions in GBTC for \npurposes of calculating position and exercise limits.\\48\\ Thus, for \nexample, assuming a 250,000-contract position limit for options on \nGBTC, the Exchange would restrict a market participant from holding \npositions that could result in the receipt of more than 250,000,000 \nshares (if that market participant exercised all its GBTC options).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\48\\ See proposed Rules 5.32-O(f)(1) (excluding GBTC options \nfrom prohibition against FLEX trading); and 5.35-O(b)(iii) (adopting \nrequirement that any FLEX and non-FLEX positions in GBTC be \naggregated for purposes of calculating position and exercise limits \nfor GBTC as set forth in Rules 6.8-O and 6.9-O).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The share creation and redemption process available to GBTC is \ndesigned to ensure that an ETF's price closely tracks the value of its \nunderlying asset. For example, if a market participant exercised a long \ncall position for 25,000 contracts and purchased 2,500,000 shares of \nGBTC and this purchase resulted in the value of GBTC shares to trade at \na premium to the value of the (underlying) bitcoin held by GBTC, the \nExchange believes that other market participants would attempt to \narbitrage this price difference by selling short GBTC shares while \nconcurrently purchasing bitcoin. Those market participants \n(arbitrageurs) would then deliver cash to GBTC and receive shares of \nGBTC, which would be used to close out any previously established short \nposition in GBTC. Thus, this creation and redemptions process would \nsignificantly reduce the potential risk of price dislocation between \nthe value of\n\n[[Page 22124]]\n\nGBTC shares and the value of bitcoin holdings.\n    The Exchange understands that FLEX Options on ETFs are currently \ntraded in the OTC market by a variety of market participants, e.g., \nhedge funds, proprietary trading firms, and pension funds, to name a \nfew. The Exchange believes there is room for significant growth if a \ncomparable product were introduced for trading on a regulated market. \nThe Exchange expects that users of these OTC products would be among \nthe primary users of FLEX GBTC options. The Exchange also believes that \nthe trading of FLEX GBTC options would allow these same market \nparticipants to better manage the risk associated with the volatility \nof GBTC (the underlying ETF) positions given the enhanced liquidity \nthat an exchange-traded product would bring. Additionally, the Exchange \nbelieves that FLEX GBTC options traded on the Exchange would have three \nimportant advantages over the contracts that are traded in the OTC \nmarket. First, because of greater standardization of contract terms, \nexchange-traded contracts should develop more liquidity. Second, \ncounter-party credit risk would be mitigated by the fact that the \ncontracts are issued and guaranteed by OCC. Finally, the price \ndiscovery and dissemination provided by the Exchange and its members \nwould lead to more transparent markets. The Exchange believes that its \nability to offer FLEX GBTC options would aid it in competing with the \nOTC market and at the same time expand the universe of products \navailable to interested market participants. The Exchange believes that \nan exchange-traded alternative may provide a useful risk management and \ntrading vehicle for market participants and their customers.\n    The Exchange has analyzed its capacity and represents that it and \nThe Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') have the necessary \nsystems capacity to handle the additional traffic associated with the \nlisting of FLEX GBTC options. The Exchange believes any additional \ntraffic that would be generated from the trading of FLEX GBTC options \nwould be manageable. The Exchange believes OTP Holders will not have a \ncapacity issue as a result of this proposed rule change. The Exchange \nalso represents that it does not believe this proposed rule change will \ncause fragmentation of liquidity. The Exchange will monitor the trading \nvolume associated with the additional options series listed as a result \nof this proposed rule change and the effect (if any) of these \nadditional series on market fragmentation and on the capacity of the \nExchange's automated systems.\n    The Exchange represents that the same surveillance procedures \napplicable to the Exchange's other options products listed and traded \non the Exchange, including non-FLEX GBTC options, will apply to FLEX \nGBTC options, and that it has the necessary systems capacity to support \nsuch options. FLEX options products (and their respective symbols) are \nintegrated into the Exchange's existing surveillance system \narchitecture and are thus subject to the relevant surveillance \nprocesses. The Exchange's market surveillance staff (including staff of \nFINRA who perform surveillance and investigative work on behalf of the \nExchange pursuant to a regulatory services agreement) conducts \nsurveillances with respect to GBTC (the underlying ETF) and, as \nappropriate, would review activity in GBTC when conducting \nsurveillances for market abuse or manipulation in the FLEX GBTC \noptions.\\49\\ The Exchange does not believe that allowing FLEX GBTC \noptions would render the marketplace for non-FLEX GBTC options, or \nequity options in general, more susceptible to manipulative practices.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\49\\ See GBTC Options Approval Order, 89 FR at 84966-68 \n(regarding surveillance procedures applicable to GBTC and other \nfunds that hold bitcoin).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange represents that its existing trading surveillances are \nadequate to monitor the trading in GBTC as well as any subsequent \ntrading of FLEX GBTC options on the Exchange. Additionally, the \nExchange is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') \nunder the ISG Agreement. ISG members work together to coordinate \nsurveillance and investigative information sharing in the stock, \noptions, and futures markets. In addition to the surveillance that is \nconducted by the Exchange's market surveillance staff, the Exchange \nwould also be able to obtain information regarding trading in shares of \nGBTC on other exchanges through ISG. In addition, and as referenced \nabove, the Exchange has a regulatory services agreement with FINRA, \npursuant to which FINRA conducts certain surveillances on behalf of the \nExchange. Further, pursuant to a multi-party 17d-2 joint plan, all \noptions exchanges allocate regulatory responsibilities to FINRA to \nconduct certain options-related market surveillances.\\50\\ The Exchange \nwill implement any additional surveillance procedures it deems \nnecessary to effectively monitor the trading of GBTC options.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\50\\ Section 19(g)(1) of the Act, among other things, requires \nevery SRO registered as a national securities exchange or national \nsecurities association to comply with the Act, the rules and \nregulations thereunder, and the SRO's own rules, and, absent \nreasonable justification or excuse, enforce compliance by its \nmembers and persons associated with its members. See 15 U.S.C. \n78q(d)(1) and 17 CFR 240.17d-2. Section 17(d)(1) of the Act allows \nthe Commission to relieve an SRO of certain responsibilities with \nrespect to members of the SRO who are also members of another SRO. \nSpecifically, Section 17(d)(1) allows the Commission to relieve an \nSRO of its responsibilities to: (i) receive regulatory reports from \nsuch members; (ii) examine such members for compliance with the Act \nand the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the SRO; \nor (iii) carry out other specified regulatory responsibilities with \nrespect to such members.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The proposed rule change is designed to allow investors seeking to \ntrade options on GBTC to utilize FLEX GBTC options. The Exchange \nbelieves that offering innovative products flows to the benefit of the \ninvesting public. A robust and competitive market requires that \nexchanges respond to member's evolving needs by constantly improving \ntheir offerings. Such efforts would be stymied if exchanges were \nprohibited from offering innovative products such as the proposed FLEX \nGBTC options. The Exchange believes that introducing FLEX GBTC options \nwould further broaden the base of investors that use FLEX Options (and \noptions on GBTC in general) to manage their trading and investment \nrisk, including investors that currently trade in the OTC market for \ncustomized options. The proposed rule change is also designed to \nencourage Market Makers to shift liquidity from the OTC market on the \nExchange, which, it believes, will enhance the process of price \ndiscovery conducted on the Exchange through increased order flow.\nImplementation\n    The Exchange will announce the implementation date by Trader Update \nwithin sixty (60) days of rule approval.\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section \n6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act''),\\51\\ in \ngeneral, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\\52\\ \nin particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable \nprinciples of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism \nof a free and open market and a national market system, and, in \ngeneral, to protect investors and the public interest.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\51\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\52\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22125]]\n\nPosition Limits\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change to remove the \n25,000-contract position (and exercise) limit on GBTC options thus \nallowing such options to qualify for higher aggregated limits will \nremove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open \nmarket and a national market system, and, in general, protect investors \nand the public interest as it will provide market participants with the \nability to more effectively execute their trading and hedging \nactivities. In addition, this proposed change may allow Market Makers \nto maintain their liquidity in these options in amounts commensurate \nwith the continued demand for GBTC options. Further, an increased \naggregated position (and exercise) limit on GBTC options may encourage \nother liquidity providers to continue to trade on the Exchange rather \nthan shift their volume to OTC markets, which will enhance the process \nof price discovery conducted on the Exchange through increased order \nflow. The Exchange notes that permitting a higher aggregated position \n(and exercise) limit on GBTC options would further allow institutional \ninvestors to utilize such options for prudent risk management purposes.\n    As noted herein, the Exchange analyzed several data points that \nsupport the appropriateness of an aggregated position (and exercise) \nlimit of 250,000 contracts for GBTC options based on recent trading \nvolume in GBTC. Specifically, a comparison of GBTC's market \ncapitalization to the bitcoin market in terms of exercise risk and \navailability of deliverables revealed that the exercisable risk of an \naggregated limit of 250,000 contracts represented 9.13% of GBTC shares \noutstanding. Further, since GBTC has a creation and redemption process \nmanaged through the issuer (whereby bitcoin is used to create GBTC \nshares), a 250,000-contract position (and exercise) limit as compared \nto the market capitalization of the bitcoin market indicated that the \nexercisable risk for GBTC options represented less than 0.10% of all \nbitcoin outstanding. Moreover, a comparison of a 250,000-contract \nposition limit for GBTC options to the (actual) position limits for \nequivalent bitcoin futures revealed that a 250,000-contract limit would \nbe appropriate. Finally, the Exchange compared an aggregated position \nlimit of 250,000 contracts for GBTC options against GLD, another \ncommodity-backed ETF. A position limit exercise in GLD represents 8.17% \nof the float of GLD. By comparison, a position limit exercise in GBTC \noptions (assuming a 250,000-contract limit) would represent 9.13% of \nthe GBTC float. Although a 250,000-contract position (and exercise) \nlimit on GBTC options would not be as conservative as the standard \napplied to GLD, it is comparable and therefore appropriate.\nFLEX GBTC Options\n    The Exchange believes that the proposal to permit FLEX GBTC options \nand to require aggregation of any FLEX and non-FLEX positions in GBTC \nfor purpose of calculating position and exercise limits would remove \nimpediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market for \nseveral reasons. First, the Exchange believes that offering FLEX GBTC \noptions will benefit investors by providing them with an additional, \nrelatively lower cost investing tool to gain exposure to the price of \nbitcoin and provide a hedging vehicle to meet their investment needs in \nconnection with a bitcoin-related product. Moreover, the proposal would \nbroaden the base of investors that use FLEX Options to manage their \ntrading and investment risk, including investors that currently trade \nin the OTC market for customized options. By trading a product in an \nexchange-traded environment (that is currently being used in the OTC \nmarket), the Exchange would be able to compete more effectively with \nthe OTC market. The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in \nthat it would lead to the migration of options currently trading in the \nOTC market to trading to the Exchange. Also, any migration to the \nExchange from the OTC market would result in increased market \ntransparency and enhance the process of price discovery conducted on \nthe Exchange through increased order flow. The Exchange also believes \nthat offering FLEX GBTC options may open up the market for GBTC options \nto more retail investors.\n    Additionally, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is \ndesigned to remove impediments to and to perfect the mechanism for a \nfree and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to \nprotect investors and the public interest because FLEX GBTC options are \ndesigned to create greater trading and hedging opportunities and \nflexibility. The proposed rule change should also result in enhanced \nefficiency in initiating and closing out positions and heightened \ncontra-party creditworthiness due to the role of OCC as issuer and \nguarantor of FLEX GBTC options. Further, the proposed rule change would \nresult in increased competition by permitting the Exchange to offer \nproducts that are currently used in the OTC market.\n    The Exchange believes that offering innovative products flows to \nthe benefit of the investing public. A robust and competitive market \nrequires that exchanges respond to member's evolving needs by \nconstantly improving their offerings. Such efforts would be stymied if \nexchanges were prohibited from offering innovative products such as the \nproposed FLEX GBTC options. The Exchange does not believe that allowing \nFLEX GBTC options would render the marketplace for equity options more \nsusceptible to manipulative practices.\n    Finally, the Exchange represents that it has an adequate \nsurveillance program in place to detect manipulative trading in FLEX \nGBTC options. Regarding the proposed FLEX GBTC options, the Exchange \nwould use the same surveillance procedures currently utilized for FLEX \nOptions listed on the Exchange (as well as for non-FLEX GBTC options). \nFor surveillance purposes, the Exchange would have access to \ninformation regarding trading activity in GBTC (the underlying \nETF).\\53\\ In light of surveillance measures related to both options and \nGBTC (the underlying ETF), the Exchange believes that existing \nsurveillance procedures are designed to deter and detect possible \nmanipulative behavior which might potentially arise from listing and \ntrading the proposed FLEX GBTC options.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\53\\ See GBTC Options Approval Order, 89 FR at 84966-68 \n(regarding surveillance procedures applicable to GBTC and other \nfunds that hold bitcoin).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act.\n    Position Limits. The Exchange believes that its proposal to remove \nthe 25,000-contract position and exercise limit on GBTC options, thus \nallowing such limits to increase, will not burden intra-market \ncompetition because it applies to all market participants that trade \n(or want to trade) GBTC options. The Exchange believes the proposal \nwould provide additional opportunities for market participants to \ncontinue to efficiently achieve their investment and trading objectives \nfor equity options on the Exchange. The Exchange expects that all \noption exchanges will adopt substantively similar proposals for\n\n[[Page 22126]]\n\nadopting the additional position limit tiers, such that the Exchange's \nproposal would benefit competition. For these reasons, the Exchange \ndoes not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden \non competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the \npurposes of the Act.\n    FLEX GBTC Options. The Exchange believes that the proposal to \npermit FLEX GBTC options will not impose any burden on intra-market \ncompetition as all market participants can opt to utilize this product \nor not. The proposed rule change is designed to allow investors seeking \noption exposure to bitcoin to trade FLEX GBTC options. Moreover, the \nExchange believes that the proposal to permit FLEX GBTC options would \nbroaden the base of investors that use FLEX Options to manage their \ntrading and investment risk, including investors that currently trade \nin the OTC market for customized options. The Exchange believes that \nthe proposed FLEX GBTC options will not impose any burden on inter-\nmarket competition but will instead encourage competition by increasing \nthe variety of options products available for trading on the Exchange, \nwhich products will provide a valuable tool for investors to manage \nrisk. Should this proposal be approved, competing options exchanges \nwill be free to offer products like the proposed FLEX GBTC options.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIV. Proceedings To Determine Whether To Approve or Disapprove SR-\nNYSEARCA-2025-07, as Modified by Amendment No. 3, and Grounds for \nDisapproval Under Consideration\n\n    The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section \n19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \\54\\ to determine whether the proposed rule \nchange, as modified by Amendment No. 3, should be approved or \ndisapproved.

Institution of proceedings is \nappropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised \nby the proposed rule change.

Rather, the Commission seeks and \nencourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule \nchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,\\14\\ the Commission is \nproviding notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. \nThe Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional \nanalysis of the proposed rule change's consistency with Section 6(b)(5) \nof the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a \nnational securities exchange be ``designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices'' and ``to protect investors and the \npublic interest.'' \\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ Id.\n    \\15\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the \nExchange's statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth \nin the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to \nsubmit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission \nseeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the \nTrust, which would hold SOL, is designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not \npreviously contemplated by the Commission.\n\nIV. Procedure: Request for Written Comments\n\n    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written \nsubmissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the \nissues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have \nwith the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written \nviews of interested persons concerning whether the proposal is \nconsistent with Section 6(b)(5) or any other provision of the Act, and \nthe rules and regulations thereunder.

Because the Participants designate the amendments as concerned \nsolely with the administration of the Plans, the amendments become \neffective upon filing with the Commission.\n\n4. Development and Implementation Phases\n\n    Not applicable.\n\n5. Analysis of Impact on Competition\n\n    The amendments do not impose any burden on competition because they \nsimply effectuate changes in the names of Participants. For the same \nreasons, the Participants do not believe that the amendments introduce \nterms that are unreasonably discriminatory for purposes of Section \n11A(c)(1)(D) of the Exchange Act.\n\n6. Written Understanding or Agreements Relating to Interpretation of, \nor Participation in, Plan\n\n    Not applicable.\n\n7. Approval by Sponsors in Accordance With Plan\n\n    See Item 3 above.\n\n8.

Reporting Requirements\n\n    Not applicable.\n\n3. Manner of Collecting, Processing, Sequencing, Making Available and \nDisseminating Last Sale Information\n\n    Not applicable.\n\n4.

Introduction\n\n    On January 28, 2025, Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (``BZX'' or \n``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \\1\\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\\2\\ a \nproposed rule change to list and trade shares (``Shares'') of the \nVanEck Solana Trust (``Trust'') under BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4), Commodity-\nBased Trust Shares. The proposed rule change was published for comment \nin the Federal Register on February 18, 2025.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n    \\3\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102394 (Feb. 11, \n2025), 90 FR 9746 (``Notice''). Comments received on the proposed \nrule change are available at: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2025-014/srcboebzx2025014.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2025-014/srcboebzx2025014.htm</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On March 11, 2025, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\\4\\ the \nCommission designated a longer period within which to approve the \nproposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute \nproceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule \nchange.\\5\\ This order institutes proceedings under Section 19(b)(2)(B) \nof the Act \\6\\ to determine\n\n[[Page 22131]]\n\nwhether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).\n    \\5\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102587, 90 FR 12427 \n(Mar. 17, 2025). The Commission designated May 19, 2025, as the date \nby which the Commission shall approve or disapprove, or institute \nproceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule \nchange.\n    \\6\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nII. Summary of the Proposal\n\n    As described in more detail in the Notice,\\7\\ the Exchange proposes \nto list and trade the Shares of the Trust under BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4), \nwhich governs the listing and trading of Commodity-Based Trust Shares \non the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See Notice, supra note 3.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect \nthe performance of the price of SOL \\8\\ less the expenses of the \nTrust's operations.\\9\\ In seeking to achieve its investment objective, \nthe Trust will hold SOL and will value its Shares daily based on the \nMarketVector\\TM\\ Solana Benchmark Rate (``Index'').\\10\\ The Trust's \nassets will only consist of SOL, cash, and cash equivalents.\\11\\ When \nthe Trust sells or redeems its Shares, it will do so in cash \ntransactions with authorized participants in blocks of 25,000 \nShares.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ The Exchange states that SOL is a digital asset that is \ncreated and transmitted through the operations of the peer-to-peer \nSolana Network, a decentralized network of computers that operates \non cryptographic protocols. See id. at 9747.\n    \\9\\ See id. at 9750. VanEck Digital Assets, LLC is the sponsor \nof the Trust, Delaware Trust Company is the trustee, and a third-\nparty custodian will be responsible for custody of the Trust's SOL. \nSee id. at 9746, 9750.\n    \\10\\ See id.\n    \\11\\ See id.\n    \\12\\ See id. at 9752.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIII. Proceedings To Determine Whether To Approve or Disapprove SR-\nCboeBZX-2025-014 and Grounds for Disapproval Under Consideration\n\n    The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section \n19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \\13\\ to determine whether the proposed rule \nchange should be approved or disapproved. Institution of proceedings is \nappropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised \nby the proposed rule change. Institution of proceedings does not \nindicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect \nto any of the issues involved. Rather, the Commission seeks and \nencourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule \nchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,\\14\\ the Commission is \nproviding notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. \nThe Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional \nanalysis of the proposed rule change's consistency with Section 6(b)(5) \nof the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a \nnational securities exchange be ``designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices'' and ``to protect investors and the \npublic interest.'' \\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ Id.\n    \\15\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the \nExchange's statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth \nin the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to \nsubmit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission \nseeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the \nTrust, which would hold SOL, is designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not \npreviously contemplated by the Commission.\n\nIV. Procedure: Request for Written Comments\n\n    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written \nsubmissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the \nissues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have \nwith the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written \nviews of interested persons concerning whether the proposal is \nconsistent with Section 6(b)(5) or any other provision of the Act, and \nthe rules and regulations thereunder. Although there do not appear to \nbe any issues relevant to approval or disapproval that would be \nfacilitated by an oral presentation of views, data, and arguments, the \nCommission will consider, pursuant to Rule 19b-4, any request for an \nopportunity to make an oral presentation.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the Securities \nActs Amendments of 1975, Public Law 94-29 (June 4, 1975), grants the \nCommission flexibility to determine what type of proceeding--either \noral or notice and opportunity for written comments--is appropriate \nfor consideration of a particular proposal by a self-regulatory \norganization. See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Senate Comm. \non Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st \nSess. 30 (1975).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and \narguments regarding whether the proposed rule change should be approved \nor disapproved by June 13, 2025. Any person who wishes to file a \nrebuttal to any other person's submission must file that rebuttal by \nJune 27, 2025.\n    Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods:\n\nElectronic Comments\n\n    <bullet> Use the Commission's internet comment form (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml\">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml</a>); or\n    <bullet> Send an email to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97e5e2fbf2baf4f8fafaf2f9e3e4d7e4f2f4b9f0f8e1\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"2654534a430b45494b4b434852556655434508414950\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

(``Exchange'' or ``NYSE \nArca'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 (``Act'' or ``Exchange Act'') \\1\\ and Rule 19b-4 \nthereunder,\\2\\ a proposed rule change to amend rules regarding the \nposition and exercise limits for options on the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini \nTrust and the Bitcoin Bitwise ETF and to permit Flexible Exchange \nOptions on the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust and the Bitwise Bitcoin \nETF. On February 14, 2025, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the \nproposed rule change. The proposed rule change, as amended, was \npublished for comment in the Federal Register on February 24, 2025.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n    \\3\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102441 (Feb. 18, \n2025), 90 FR 10518.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On March 12, 2025, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\\4\\ the \nCommission designated a longer period within which to approve the \nproposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute \nproceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule \nchange.\\5\\ The Commission has received no comments on the proposed rule \nchange, as modified by Amendment No. 1. On April 28, 2025, the Exchange \nfiled Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change (``Amendment No. \n2''), as described in Items II and III below, which Items have been \nprepared by the Exchange.\\6\\ The Commission is publishing this notice \nto solicit comments on the proposed rule change, as modified by \nAmendment No. 2, and is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section \n19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \\7\\ to determine whether to approve or \ndisapprove the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).\n    \\5\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102630, 90 FR 12614 \n(Mar. 18, 2025). The Commission designated May 25, 2025, as the date \nby which the Commission shall approve or disapprove, or institute \nproceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule \nchange.\n    \\6\\ Amendment No. 2 is available at: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2025-10/srnysearca202510-594695-1727482.pdf\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2025-10/srnysearca202510-594695-1727482.pdf</a>.\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Description of the Proposed Rule \nChange, as Modified by Amendment No. 2\n\n    The Exchange proposes to amend certain rules that restrict the \nposition and exercise limits for options on the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini \nTrust ETF (``BTC'') and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (``BITB'') and to \npermit Flexible Exchange (``FLEX'') Options on such funds. This \nAmendment No. 2 supersedes and replaces the original filing in its \nentirety.\\8\\ The proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's \nwebsite at <a href=\"http://www.nyse.com\">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the Exchange, and \nat the Commission's Public Reference Room.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ On February 14, 2025, the Exchange submitted partial \nAmendment No. 1 to its proposal to make certain technical changes to \nthe Exhibit 5 (the ``original filing''). See Securities Exchange Act \nRelease No. 102441 (February 18, 2025), 90 FR 10518 (February 24, \n2025) (SR-NYSEARCA-2025-10) (the ``Notice''). This Amendment No. 2 \nmodifies the original filing to make clarifying changes to the \nPurpose section to reflect that the proposed position and exercise \nlimits for options on BTC and BITB will be the same as the position \nand exercise limits for other equity options (i.e., not a fixed \nlimit of 25,000 contracts) and that any FLEX and non-FLEX positions \nin the same underlying ETF must be aggregated for purposes of \ncalculating position and exercise limits for that ETF, which changes \nmore closely align with the rule text in the Exhibit 5. The Exchange \nalso proposes a technical change to replace rule text references to \n``the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC'' and ``the Bitwise Bitcoin \nETF'' with their respective ticker symbol (i.e., BTC and BITB).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend certain rules that restrict the \nposition and exercise limits for options on BTC and BITB (each a \n``Fund'' and, collectively, the ``Funds'') and to permit options on the \nFunds to trade as FLEX Equity Options (``FLEX Fund options'') as \ndescribed herein. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to (1) amend \nCommentary .06(f) to Rule 6.8-O (Position Limits) to remove the 25,000-\ncontract position limit on BTC and BITB options thus allowing such \nlimits for each Fund to be increased; \\9\\ and (2) amend Rules 5.32-\nO(f)(1) (Terms of FLEX) and 5.36-O(b) (Position Limits) to permit FLEX \ntrading of Fund options and to require the aggregation of any FLEX and \nnon-FLEX positions in the same underlying Fund for purposes of \ncalculating position and exercise limits for such Fund.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ As discussed herein, the removal of BTC and BITB (and \nassociated 25,000-contact limits) from Commentary .06(f) means the \nposition limit for options on BTC an [sic] BITB will be determined \nbased on trading in each Fund during the most recent six-month \nperiod. See Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .06(a)-(e). As discussed herein, \nBTC and BITB currently qualify for options position (and exercise) \nlimits of 250,000 contracts per Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .06(e)(i).\n    \\10\\ The Exchange notes that it recently submitted a \nsubstantively identical filing to increase the aggregated position \nand exercise limits for, and to permit FLEX trading of options on, \nthe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (``GBTC''), which filing is \npending with the Commission. See SR-NYSEARCA-2025-07, filed Jan. 29, \n2025. Like the Funds, GBTC is currently subject to a 25,000-contract \nposition and exercise limit and is not eligible for FLEX trading. \nSee Rules 6.8-O, Commentary .06(f); and 5.32-O(f)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes that this proposal is competitive given that \nNasdaq ISE, LLC (``ISE'') recently filed a proposal to remove the \n25,000-contract position and exercise limits applicable to options on \nthe iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (``IBIT'').\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See Amendment No 2 to Proposed Rule Change to modify the \nposition and exercise limits for IBIT options to the applicable \nposition and exercise limits as determined by Options 9, Sections 13 \nand 15 (SR-ISE-2024-62), filed Mar. 26, 2025, available at <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-ise-2024-62/srise202462-593575-1721782.pdf\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-ise-2024-62/srise202462-593575-1721782.pdf</a>. \n(``ISE IBIT Proposal''). Like BTC and BITB, IBIT is an ETF that \nholds bitcoin.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBackground\n    Each Fund is an ETF that holds bitcoin and is listed on the \nExchange.\\12\\\n\n[[Page 22133]]\n\nOn October 18, 2024, the Commission approved the listing and trading of \nFund options on NYSE American, LLC (``NYSE American'').\\13\\ On November \n22, 2024, the Exchange obtained rule authority to trade options on BTC \nand BITB.\\14\\ The position (and exercise) \\15\\ limits for options on \neach Fund are 25,000 contracts, as set forth in Rule 6.8-O, Commentary \n.06(f), the lowest limit available in options.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ NYSE Arca received approval to list and trade Bitcoin-Based \nCommodity-Based Trust Shares in BTC and BITB pursuant to NYSE Arca \nRule 8.201-E(c)(1). See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 100610 \n(July 26, 2024) (order approving listing and trading of Commodity-\nBased Trust Shares of BTC, among other ETFs), 89 FR 62821 (August 1, \n2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-2023-45); 99306 (January 10, 2024), 89 FR 3008 \n(January 17, 2024) (order approving listing and trading of \nCommodity-Based Trust Shares of BITB, among other ETFs) (SR-\nNYSEARCA-2021-90).\n    \\13\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101386 (October 18, \n2024), 89 FR 84960 (October 24, 2024) (SR-NYSEAMER-2024-49) (order \napproving rules to permit the listing and trading of options on BTC \nand BITB, among others) (the ``Fund Options Approval Order'').\n    \\14\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101713 (November \n22, 2024), 89 FR 94839 (November 29, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-2024-101) \n(notice of immediately effective rule change to permit BTC and BITB \noptions trading, based on the already-approved NYSE American rules) \n(the ``Arca Fund Options Notice'').\n    \\15\\ The Exchange notes that the exercise limit for options on \neach Fund are based on, and are always the same as, the position \nlimit for such options. See Rule 6.9-O (Exercise Limits).\n    \\16\\ Pursuant to Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .06(f), options on the \nfollowing ETFs--all of which, like BTC and BITB, hold bitcoin--are \nalso subject to a 25,000-contract position and exercise limit: GBTC, \nIBIT, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (``FBTC''), and the ARK \n21Shares Bitcoin (``ARKB'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    FLEX Equity Options are not generally subject to position or \nexercise limits.\\17\\ Today, pursuant to Rule 5.32-O(f)(1), Fund options \nare not approved for FLEX trading.\\18\\ Therefore, the 25,000-contract \nlimit applicable to each Fund currently applies solely to non-FLEX Fund \noptions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ See Rule 5.35-O(b) (subject to the exceptions enumerated in \nthe rule ``there shall be no position limits'' for FLEX Equity \nOptions).\n    \\18\\ Pursuant to Rule 5.32-O(f)(1), FLEX trading is also not \navailable for options on GBTC, IBIT, FBTC, and ARKB.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Per the Commission, ``rules regarding position and exercise limits \nare intended to prevent the establishment of options positions that can \nbe used or might create incentives to manipulate or disrupt the \nunderlying market so as to benefit the options positions.'' \\19\\ For \nthis reason, the Commission requires that ``position and exercise \nlimits must be sufficient to prevent investors from disrupting the \nmarket for the underlying security by acquiring and exercising a number \nof options contracts disproportionate to the deliverable supply and \naverage trading volume of the underlying security.'' \\20\\ Based on its \nreview of the data and analysis provided by NYSE American, the \nCommission concluded that the proposed 25,000-contract position and \nexercise limits for options on BTC and BITB satisfied these \nobjectives.\\21\\ The Exchange adopted the already-approved 25,000-\ncontract limit for options on BTC and options on BITB.\\22\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ See Fund Options Approval Order, 89 FR at 84971.\n    \\20\\ See id.\n    \\21\\ See id.\n    \\22\\ See Arca Fund Options Notice, 89 FR at 94842. See also Rule \n6.8-O, Commentary .06(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosition Limits\n    While NYSE American proposed an aggregated 25,000 contract position \n(and exercise) limit for options on BTC and BITB, it nonetheless \nbelieved that evidence existed to support a much higher position \nlimit.\\23\\ Specifically, in approving Fund options trading on NYSE \nAmerican, the Commission considered and reviewed NYSE American's \nanalysis that the exercisable risk associated with a position (and \nexercise) limit of 25,000 contracts represented only 0.7% and 3.6% of \nthe outstanding shares of BTC and BITB, respectively.\\24\\ The \nCommission also considered and reviewed NYSE American's arguments that \nwith a 25,000-contract limit for each Fund: (i) the 366,950,100 BTC \nshares outstanding, meant that 147 market participants would have to \nsimultaneously exercise their same-side positions to place BTC under \nstress; and (ii) the 68,690,000 BITB shares outstanding, meant that 27 \nmarket participants would have to simultaneously exercise their same-\nside positions to place BITB under stress.\\25\\ Based on the \nCommission's review of this information and analysis, the Commission \nconcluded that the proposed position and exercise limits of 25,000 \ncontracts were designed to prevent investors from disrupting the market \nfor the underlying security by acquiring and exercising a number of \noptions contracts disproportionate to the deliverable supply and \naverage trading volume of the underlying security, and to prevent the \nestablishment of options positions that can be used or might create \nincentives to manipulate or disrupt the underlying market so as to \nbenefit the options position.\\26\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ See Fund Options Approval Order, 89 FR, at 84970 (referring \nto NYSE American's argument that, as of Sept. 30, 2024, BTC traded \n335,492,930 shares and BITB traded 263,965,870 shares in the most \nrecent six months of trading, which would qualify each Fund for a \n250,000-contract position limit per NYSE American Rule 904, \nCommentary .07(a), which is identical to Arca Rule 6.8-O Commentary \n.06(e)). The Exchange notes that, as of September 30, 2024, BTC had \nbeen trading for only two months. See id.\n    \\24\\ See id. Data represents figures from FactSet as of August \n30, 2024.\n    \\25\\ See Fund Options Approval Order, 89 FR at 84971.\n    \\26\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Currently, BTC and BITB each qualify for a 250,000-limit on same-\nside contracts pursuant to Rule 6.8-O Commentary .06(e)(i), which \nrequires that trading volume for the underlying security in the most \nrecent six months be at least 100,000,000 shares.\\27\\ As of November \n25, 2024, during the most recent six-month period, trading volume for \nBTC was 163,712,700 shares. During the same period, trading volume for \nBITB was 288,800,860 shares. In addition, as of November 25, 2024, the \nmarket capitalization for BTC was $3,496,748,882,\\28\\ with an average \ndaily volume (``ADV'') for the preceding three months of 2,036,369 \nshares. During this same period, the market capitalization of BITB was \n4,095,157,000,\\29\\ with an ADV for the three prior months of 2,480,478. \nEach Fund is well above the requisite minimum of 100,000,000 shares \nnecessary to qualify for the 250,000-contract position and exercise \nlimit. Also, as of November 25, 2024, there were 19,787,762 bitcoins in \ncirculation.\\30\\ At a price of $94,830 per bitcoin,\\31\\ that equates to \na market capitalization of greater than $1.876 trillion. If an \naggregated position and exercise limit of 250,000 contracts were \nconsidered for each Fund, the exercisable risk would represent 30.14% \n\\32\\ of BTC shares outstanding; and 31.27% \\33\\ of BITB shares \noutstanding. Given the liquidity of BTC and BITB, the current 25,000-\ncontract\n\n[[Page 22134]]\n\nposition (and exercise) limit is extremely conservative.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\27\\ See Rule 6.8-O Commentary .06(e) (providing at subparagraph \n(e) that the position limit shall be 250,000 contracts for options: \n(i) on underlying stock or Exchange-Traded Fund Share that had \ntrading volume of at least 100,000,000 shares during the most recent \nsix-month trading period; or (ii) on an underlying stock or \nExchange-Traded Fund Share that had trading volume of at least \n75,000,000 shares during the most recent six-month trading period \nand has at least 300,000,000 shares currently outstanding).\n    \\28\\ The market capitalization of BTC was determined by \nmultiplying a settlement price ($42.16) by the number of shares \noutstanding (82,939,964). Data represents figures from FactSet as of \nNovember 25, 2024.\n    \\29\\ The market capitalization of BITB was determined by \nmultiplying a settlement price ($51.70) by the number of shares \noutstanding (79,950,100). Data represents figures from FactSet as of \nNovember 25, 2024.\n    \\30\\ See <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin</a>.\n    \\31\\ This is the approximate price of bitcoin from 4 p.m. ET on \nNovember 25, 2024.\n    \\32\\ This percentage is arrived at with this equation: (250,000 \ncontract limit * 100 shares per option/82,939,964 BTC shares \noutstanding).\n    \\33\\ This percentage is arrived at with this equation: (250,000 \ncontract limit * 100 shares per option/79,950,100 BITB shares \noutstanding).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As noted above, position and exercise limits are designed to limit \nthe number of options contracts traded on an exchange in an underlying \nsecurity that an investor, acting alone or in concert with others \ndirectly or indirectly, may control. These limits, which are described \nin Rules 6.8-O and 6.9-O, are intended to address potential \nmanipulative schemes and adverse market impacts surrounding the use of \noptions, such as disrupting the market in the security underlying the \noptions. Position and exercise limits must balance concerns regarding \nmitigating potential manipulation and the cost of inhibiting potential \nhedging activity that could be used for legitimate economic purposes.\n    To achieve this balance, the Exchange proposes to remove BTC and \nBITB (and the associated 25,000-contract limits) from Commentary \n.06(f), which would enable options on BTC and BITB to trade in the same \nmanner as options on other ETFs not included in this Commentary.\\34\\ \nSpecifically, for each Fund, this proposal would result in an increased \nposition (and exercise) limit from 25,000 to 250,000 same-side \ncontracts, pursuant to Commentary .06(e)(i). In addition, like options \non other ETFs not listed in Commentary .06(f), position limits for \noptions on BTC or BITB would be subject to subsequent six (6) month \nreviews to determine future position (and exercise) limits.\\35\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\34\\ See proposed Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .06(f). The Exchange \nnotes that the ETFs included in Commentary .06(f) (other than ETFs \nlike BTC and BITB that hold bitcoin) have significantly higher \nposition limits than are authorized by Rule, which increases were \nsubject to Exchange rule filings.\n    \\35\\ See Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .06(e) (providing that, every \nsix months, the Exchange will review the volume and outstanding \nshare information on all underlying ETFs on which options are traded \nmonths to determine applicable position limits). See also Rule 6.9-O \n(providing that exercise limits for options on an underlying will be \nthe same as the position limits for such underlying).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In addition to determining each Fund's eligibility for a 250,000-\ncontract position (and exercise) limit per Commentary .06(e)(i), the \nExchange performed additional analyses regarding BTC and BITB in \nsupport of this proposal. First, the Exchange reviewed the Funds' data \nrelative to the market capitalization of the entire bitcoin market in \nterms of exercise risk and availability of deliverables. As noted \nabove, as of November 25, 2024, there were 19,787,762 bitcoins in \ncirculation.\\36\\ At a price of $94,830 per bitcoin,\\37\\ that equates to \na market capitalization of greater than $1.876 trillion. If an \naggregated position (and exercise) limit of 250,000 contracts were \nconsidered for each Fund, the exercisable risk would represent 30.14% \nof BTC shares outstanding \\38\\ and 31.27% of BITB shares \noutstanding.\\39\\ Since each Fund has a creation and redemption process \nmanaged through the issuer (whereby bitcoin is used to create shares of \nBTC or BITB, as applicable), the position (and exercise) limit can be \ncompared to the total market capitalization of the entire bitcoin \nmarket, and in that case, the exercisable risk for options on each Fund \nwould represent less than 0.06% (BTC) or 0.07% (BITB) of all bitcoin \noutstanding.\\40\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\36\\ See <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin</a>.\n    \\37\\ This is the approximate price of bitcoin from 4 p.m. ET on \nNovember 25, 2024.\n    \\38\\ This percentage is arrived at with this equation: (250,000 \ncontract limit * 100 shares per option/82,939,964 BTC shares \noutstanding).\n    \\39\\ This percentage is arrived at with this equation: (250,000 \ncontract limit * 100 shares per option/79,950,100 BITB shares \noutstanding).\n    \\40\\ For BTC, this number was arrived at with this calculation: \n((250,000 limit * 100 shares per option * $42.16 settle)/(19,787,762 \nbitcoin outstanding * $94,830 bitcoin price)); and for BITB, this \nnumber was arrived at with this calculation: ((250,000 limit * 100 \nshares per option * $51.70 settle)/(19,787,762 bitcoin outstanding * \n$94,830 bitcoin price)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes that if options on each Fund were subject to a \n250,000-contract position and exercise limit (based on underlying \ntrading volume) and if all options on each Fund were exercised at once, \nthis occurrence would have a virtually unnoticed impact on the entire \nbitcoin market. This analysis demonstrates that a 250,000-contract \nposition (and exercise) limit for options on each Fund would be \nappropriate given the liquidity of BTC and BITB.\n    Next, the Exchange reviewed the proposed position limit by \ncomparing it to position limits for derivative products regulated by \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''). While the CFTC, \nthrough the relevant Designated Contract Markets, only regulates \noptions positions based upon delta equivalents (creating a less \nstringent standard), the Exchange examined equivalent bitcoin futures \nposition limits. In particular, the Exchange looked to the Chicago \nMercantile Exchange (``CME'') bitcoin futures contract,\\41\\ which has a \nposition limit of 2,000 futures (for the initial spot month).\\42\\ On \nOctober 22, 2024, CME bitcoin futures settled at $94,945.\\43\\ On \nOctober 22, 2024, BTC settled at $29.90 and BITB settled at $36.74, \nwhich would equate to approximately 31,754,181 and 25,842,406 shares of \nBTC and BITB, respectively, if the CME notional position limit was \nutilized. Since substantial portions of any distributed options \nportfolio are likely to be out of the money on expiration, an options \nposition limit equivalent to the CME position limit for bitcoin futures \n(considering that all options deltas are <=1.00) should be a bit higher \nthan the CME implied limit of 317,541 (BTC) and 258,424 (BITB).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\41\\ CME Bitcoin Futures are described in Chapter 350 of CME's \nRulebook.\n    \\42\\ See the Position Accountability and Reportable Level Table \nin the Interpretations & Special Notices Section of Chapter 5 of \nCME's Rulebook. Each CME bitcoin futures contract is valued at five \nbitcoins as defined by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (``BRR''). \nSee CME Rule 35001.\n    \\43\\ 2,000 futures at a 5-bitcoin multiplier (per the contract \nspecifications) equates to $949,450,000 (2000 contracts * 5 BTC per \ncontract * $94,945 price of November BTC future) of notional value.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Of note, unlike options contracts, CME position limits are \ncalculated on a net futures-equivalent basis by contract and include \ncontracts that aggregate into one or more base contracts according to \nan aggregation ratio(s).\\44\\ Therefore, if a portfolio includes \npositions in options on futures, CME would aggregate those positions \ninto the underlying futures contracts in accordance with a table \npublished by CME on a delta equivalent value for the relevant spot \nmonth, subsequent spot month, single month and all month position \nlimits.\\45\\ If a position exceeds position limits because of an option \nassignment, CME permits market participants to liquidate the excess \nposition within one business day without being considered in violation \nof its rules. Additionally, if at the close of trading, a position that \nincludes options exceeds position limits for futures contracts, when \nevaluated using the delta factors as of that day's close of trading but \ndoes not exceed the limits when evaluated using the previous day's \ndelta factors, then the position shall not constitute a position limit \nviolation. Considering CME's position limits on bitcoin futures, the \nExchange believes a 250,000-contract limit for options on each Fund \nwould be appropriate.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\44\\ See <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/market-regulation/position-limits/position-limits-aggregation-of-contracts-and-table.htm\">https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/market-regulation/position-limits/position-limits-aggregation-of-contracts-and-table.htm</a>.\n    \\45\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Finally, the Exchange analyzed a position and exercise limit of \n250,000 for BTC and BITB against options on SPDR Gold Shares (``GLD''), \nwhich (like BTC and BITB), is a commodity-backed ETF.\\46\\ The Exchange \nnotes that GLD has a float of 306.1 million shares and a\n\n[[Page 22135]]\n\nposition limit of 250,000 contracts.\\47\\ As previously noted, position \nand exercise limits are designed to limit the number of options \ncontracts traded on the exchange in an underlying security that an \ninvestor, acting alone or in concert with others directly or \nindirectly, may control. A position limit exercise in GLD would \nrepresent 8.17% of the float of GLD. In comparison, a 250,000-contract \nposition limit in each of BTC and BITB, would represent 30.14% of the \nBTC float and 31.27% of the BITB float. While less conservative than \nthe standard applied to options on GLD, the Exchange nonetheless \nbelieves that subjecting options on BTC and BITB to a 250,000-contract \nposition and exercise limit would be appropriate.\\48\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\46\\ Like BTC and BITB, GLD holds one asset in trust.\n    \\47\\ See <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-gold-shares-gld\">https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-gold-shares-gld</a>.\n    \\48\\ See, e.g., Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .06(e) (setting forth \ntrading volume requirements to qualify for a 250,000-contract \nposition (and exercise) limit).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Based on the foregoing, the Exchange believes that it has \ndemonstrated that BTC and BITB each have more than sufficient liquidity \nto garner an increased position and exercise limit of 250,000 same-side \ncontracts. The Exchange believes that the significant liquidity present \nin each Fund mitigates against the potential for manipulation.\n    The Exchange believes that allowing options on each Fund to have \nincreased aggregated position and exercise limits would lead to a more \nliquid and competitive market environment for such options, which will \nbenefit customers that trade these options. Further, the reporting \nrequirement for such options would remain unchanged. Thus, the Exchange \nwill still require that each member that maintains positions in options \non BTC or BITB, on the same side of the market, for its own account or \nfor the account of a customer, report certain information to the \nExchange. This information includes, but would not be limited to, the \noptions positions, whether such positions are hedged and, if so, a \ndescription of the hedge(s). Market Makers \\49\\ would continue to be \nexempt from this reporting requirement, however, the Exchange may \naccess Market Maker position information.\\50\\ Moreover, the Exchange's \nrequirement that members file reports with the Exchange for any \ncustomer who held aggregate large long or short positions on the same \nside of the market of 200 or more option contracts of any single class \nfor the previous day will remain at this level.\\51\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\49\\ Per Rule 6.32-O(a), a Market Maker is an individual who is \nregistered with the Exchange for the purpose of making transactions \nas a dealer-specialist.\n    \\50\\ The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') through the \nLarge Option Position Reporting (``LOPR'') system acts as a \ncentralized service provider for OTP Holder compliance with position \nreporting requirements by collecting data from each OTP Holder or \nOTP Firm, consolidating the information, and ultimately providing \ndetailed listings of each TPH's report to the Exchange, as well as \nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (``FINRA''), acting as \nits agent pursuant to a regulatory services agreement (``RSA'').\n    \\51\\ See Rule 6.6-O. Reporting of Options Positions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also has no reason to believe that the growth in \ntrading volume in options on BTC and BITB will not continue. Rather, \nthe Exchange expects continued volume growth in Fund options as \nopportunities for investors to participate in the options markets \nincrease and evolve. The Exchange believes that the current position \nand exercise limits in Fund options are restrictive and will hamper the \nlisted options markets from being able to compete fairly and \neffectively with the over-the-counter (``OTC'') markets. OTC \ntransactions occur through bilateral agreements, the terms of which are \nnot publicly disclosed to the marketplace. As such, OTC transactions do \nnot contribute to the price discovery process on a public exchange or \nother lit markets. The Exchange believes that without the proposed \nchanges to position and exercise limits for options on BTC and BITB, \nmarket participants will find the 25,000-contract position limit an \nimpediment to their business and investment objectives as well as an \nimpediment to efficient pricing. As a result, market participants may \nfind the less transparent OTC markets a more attractive alternative to \nachieve their investment and hedging objectives, leading to a retreat \nfrom the listed options markets, where trades are subject to reporting \nrequirements and daily surveillance.\n    The Exchange believes that the existing surveillance procedures and \nreporting requirements at the Exchange are capable of properly \nidentifying disruptive and/or manipulative trading activity. The \nExchange also represents that it has adequate surveillances in place to \ndetect potential manipulation, as well as reviews in place to identify \ncontinued compliance with the Exchange's listing standards. These \nprocedures monitor market activity to identify unusual activity in both \noptions and the underlying equities.\nFLEX Fund Options\n    The Exchange also proposes to permit BTC and BITB to trade as \n``FLEX Fund options,'' and would require the aggregation of any FLEX \nand non-FLEX positions in the same underlying Fund for purposes of \ncalculating position and exercise limits on such Fund.\\52\\ Thus, for \nexample, assuming a 250,000-contract position limit for options on BTC, \nthe Exchange would restrict a market participant from holding positions \nthat could result in the receipt of more than 250,000,000 shares (if \nthat market participant exercised all its BTC options).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\52\\ See proposed Rules 5.32-O(f)(1) (excluding options on BTC \nand BITB from prohibition against FLEX trading); and 5.35-O(b)(iii) \n(adopting requirement that FLEX and non-FLEX positions in the same \nunderlying Fund must be aggregated for purposes of calculating \nposition and exercise limits on that Fund as set forth in Rules 6.8-\nO and 6.9-O).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The share creation and redemption process available to each Fund is \ndesigned to ensure that an ETF's price closely tracks the value of its \nunderlying asset. For example, if a market participant exercised a long \ncall position for 25,000 contracts and purchased 2,500,000 shares of \nBTC and this purchase resulted in the value of BTC shares to trade at a \npremium to the value of the (underlying) bitcoin held by BTC, the \nExchange believes that other market participants would attempt to \narbitrage this price difference by selling short BTC shares while \nconcurrently purchasing bitcoin. Those market participants \n(arbitrageurs) would then deliver cash to BTC and receive shares of \nBTC, which would be used to close out any previously established short \nposition in BTC. Thus, this creation and redemptions process would \nsignificantly reduce the potential risk of price dislocation between \nthe value of BTC shares and the value of bitcoin holdings.\n    The Exchange understands that FLEX Options on ETFs are currently \ntraded in the OTC market by a variety of market participants, e.g., \nhedge funds, proprietary trading firms, and pension funds, to name a \nfew. The Exchange believes there is room for significant growth if a \ncomparable product were introduced for trading on a regulated market. \nThe Exchange expects that users of these OTC products would be among \nthe primary users of FLEX options on BTC and BITB. The Exchange also \nbelieves that the trading of FLEX Fund options would allow these same \nmarket participants to better manage the risk associated with the \nvolatility of BTC or BITB (the underlying ETF) positions given the \nenhanced liquidity that an exchange-traded product would bring. \nAdditionally, the Exchange believes that FLEX Fund options traded on \nthe Exchange would have three important advantages over the contracts \nthat are\n\n[[Page 22136]]\n\ntraded in the OTC market. First, because of greater standardization of \ncontract terms, exchange-traded contracts should develop more \nliquidity. Second, counter-party credit risk would be mitigated by the \nfact that the contracts are issued and guaranteed by OCC. Finally, the \nprice discovery and dissemination provided by the Exchange and its \nmembers would lead to more transparent markets. The Exchange believes \nthat its ability to offer FLEX Fund options would aid it in competing \nwith the OTC market and at the same time expand the universe of \nproducts available to interested market participants. The Exchange \nbelieves that an exchange-traded alternative may provide a useful risk \nmanagement and trading vehicle for market participants and their \ncustomers.\n    The Exchange has analyzed its capacity and represents that it and \nThe Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') have the necessary \nsystems capacity to handle the additional traffic associated with the \nlisting of FLEX Fund options. The Exchange believes any additional \ntraffic that would be generated from the trading of FLEX Fund options \nwould be manageable. The Exchange believes OTP Holders will not have a \ncapacity issue as a result of this proposed rule change. The Exchange \nalso represents that it does not believe this proposed rule change will \ncause fragmentation of liquidity. The Exchange will monitor the trading \nvolume associated with the additional options series listed as a result \nof this proposed rule change and the effect (if any) of these \nadditional series on market fragmentation and on the capacity of the \nExchange's automated systems.\n    The Exchange represents that the same surveillance procedures \napplicable to the Exchange's other options products listed and traded \non the Exchange, including non-FLEX Fund options, will apply to FLEX \nFund options, and that it has the necessary systems capacity to support \nsuch options. FLEX options products (and their respective symbols) are \nintegrated into the Exchange's existing surveillance system \narchitecture and are thus subject to the relevant surveillance \nprocesses. The Exchange's market surveillance staff (including staff of \nFINRA who perform surveillance and investigative work on behalf of the \nExchange pursuant to a regulatory services agreement) conducts \nsurveillances with respect to BTC and BITB (the underlying ETFs) and, \nas appropriate, would review activity in BTC and BITB when conducting \nsurveillances for market abuse or manipulation in the FLEX options on \neach Fund.\\53\\ The Exchange does not believe that allowing FLEX Fund \noptions would render the marketplace for non-FLEX Fund options, or \nequity options in general, more susceptible to manipulative practices.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\53\\ See Fund Options Approval Order, 89 FR at 84966-68 \n(regarding surveillance procedures applicable to BTC, BITB, and \nother funds that hold bitcoin).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange represents that its existing trading surveillances are \nadequate to monitor the trading in BTC and BITB as well as any \nsubsequent trading of FLEX Fund options on the Exchange. Additionally, \nthe Exchange is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group \n(``ISG'') under the ISG Agreement. ISG members work together to \ncoordinate surveillance and investigative information sharing in the \nstock, options, and futures markets. In addition to the surveillance \nthat is conducted by the Exchange's market surveillance staff, the \nExchange would also be able to obtain information regarding trading in \nshares of BTC and BITB on other exchanges through ISG. In addition, and \nas referenced above, the Exchange has a regulatory services agreement \nwith FINRA, pursuant to which FINRA conducts certain surveillances on \nbehalf of the Exchange. Further, pursuant to a multi-party 17d-2 joint \nplan, all options exchanges allocate regulatory responsibilities to \nFINRA to conduct certain options-related market surveillances.\\54\\ The \nExchange will implement any additional surveillance procedures it deems \nnecessary to effectively monitor the trading of BTC and BITB options.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\54\\ Section 19(g)(1) of the Act, among other things, requires \nevery SRO registered as a national securities exchange or national \nsecurities association to comply with the Act, the rules and \nregulations thereunder, and the SRO's own rules, and, absent \nreasonable justification or excuse, enforce compliance by its \nmembers and persons associated with its members. See 15 U.S.C. \n78q(d)(1) and 17 CFR 240.17d-2. Section 17(d)(1) of the Act allows \nthe Commission to relieve an SRO of certain responsibilities with \nrespect to members of the SRO who are also members of another SRO. \nSpecifically, Section 17(d)(1) allows the Commission to relieve an \nSRO of its responsibilities to: (i) receive regulatory reports from \nsuch members; (ii) examine such members for compliance with the Act \nand the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the SRO; \nor (iii) carry out other specified regulatory responsibilities with \nrespect to such members.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The proposed rule change is designed to allow investors seeking to \ntrade options on each Fund to utilize FLEX Fund options. The Exchange \nbelieves that offering innovative products flows to the benefit of the \ninvesting public. A robust and competitive market requires that \nexchanges respond to members' evolving needs by constantly improving \ntheir offerings. Such efforts would be stymied if exchanges were \nprohibited from offering innovative products such as the proposed FLEX \nFund options. The Exchange believes that introducing FLEX Fund options \nwould further broaden the base of investors that use FLEX Options (and \noptions on BTC or BITB, in general) to manage their trading and \ninvestment risk, including investors that currently trade in the OTC \nmarket for customized options. The proposed rule change is also \ndesigned to encourage Market Makers to shift liquidity from the OTC \nmarket on the Exchange, which, it believes, will enhance the process of \nprice discovery conducted on the Exchange through increased order flow.\nImplementation\n    The Exchange will announce the implementation date by Trader Update \nwithin sixty (60) days of rule approval.\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section \n6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act''),\\55\\ in \ngeneral, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\\56\\ \nin particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable \nprinciples of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism \nof a free and open market and a national market system, and, in \ngeneral, to protect investors and the public interest.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\55\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\56\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosition Limits\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change to remove the \n25,000-contract position (and exercise) limit on BTC and BITB options \nthus allowing such options to qualify for higher aggregated limits will \nremove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open \nmarket and a national market system, and, in general, protect investors \nand the public interest as it will provide market participants with the \nability to more effectively execute their trading and hedging \nactivities. In addition, this proposed change may allow Market Makers \nto maintain their liquidity in these options in amounts commensurate \nwith the continued demand for BTC and BITB options. Further, an \nincreased aggregated position (and exercise) limit on BTC and BITB \noptions may encourage other liquidity providers to continue to trade on \nthe Exchange rather than shift their volume to OTC markets, which will \nenhance the process of price\n\n[[Page 22137]]\n\ndiscovery conducted on the Exchange through increased order flow. The \nExchange notes that permitting a higher aggregated position (and \nexercise) limit on BTC and BITB options would further allow \ninstitutional investors to utilize such options for prudent risk \nmanagement purposes.\n    As noted herein, the Exchange analyzed several data points that \nsupport the appropriateness of an aggregated position (and exercise) \nlimit of 250,000 contracts for BTC and BITB options based on recent \ntrading volume in each Fund. Specifically, a comparison of each Fund's \nmarket capitalization to the bitcoin market in terms of exercise risk \nand availability of deliverables revealed that the exercisable risk of \nan aggregated limit of 250,000 contracts represented 30.14% and 31.27% \nof BTC and BITB shares outstanding. Further, since each Fund has a \ncreation and redemption process managed through the issuer (whereby \nbitcoin is used to create BTC or BITB shares, as applicable), a \n250,000-contract position (and exercise) limit as compared to the \nmarket capitalization of the bitcoin market indicated that the \nexercisable risk for options on each Fund represented less than 0.06% \n(BTC) or 0.07% (BITB) of all bitcoin outstanding.\n    Moreover, a comparison of a 250,000-contract position limit for \noptions on each Fund to the (actual) position limits for equivalent \nbitcoin futures revealed that a 250,000-contract limit for each Fund \nwould be appropriate. Finally, the Exchange compared an aggregated \nposition limit of 250,000 contracts for each Fund against GLD, another \ncommodity-backed ETF. A position limit exercise in GLD represents 8.17% \nof the float of GLD. By comparison, a position limit exercise in each \nFund (assuming a 250,000-contract limit would represent 30.14% (BTC) \nand 31.27% (BITB) of that Fund's float. Although a 250,000-contract \nposition (and exercise) limit on BTC and BITB options would not be as \nconservative as the standard applied to GLD, it is comparable and \ntherefore appropriate.\nFLEX Fund Options\n    The Exchange believes that the proposal to permit FLEX Fund options \nand to require aggregation of any FLEX and non-FLEX positions in the \nsame underlying Fund for purpose of calculating position and exercise \nlimits would remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free \nand open market for several reasons. First, the Exchange believes that \noffering FLEX Fund options will benefit investors by providing them \nwith an additional, relatively lower cost investing tool to gain \nexposure to the price of bitcoin and provide a hedging vehicle to meet \ntheir investment needs in connection with a bitcoin-related product. \nMoreover, the proposal would broaden the base of investors that use \nFLEX Options to manage their trading and investment risk, including \ninvestors that currently trade in the OTC market for customized \noptions. By trading a product in an exchange-traded environment (that \nis currently being used in the OTC market), the Exchange would be able \nto compete more effectively with the OTC market. The Exchange believes \nthe proposed rule change is designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices in that it would lead to the migration \nof options currently trading in the OTC market to trading to the \nExchange. Also, any migration to the Exchange from the OTC market would \nresult in increased market transparency and enhance the process of \nprice discovery conducted on the Exchange through increased order flow. \nThe Exchange also believes that offering FLEX Fund options may open up \nthe market for options on these Funds to more retail investors.\n    Additionally, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is \ndesigned to remove impediments to and to perfect the mechanism for a \nfree and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to \nprotect investors and the public interest because FLEX Fund options are \ndesigned to create greater trading and hedging opportunities and \nflexibility. The proposed rule change should also result in enhanced \nefficiency in initiating and closing out positions and heightened \ncontra-party creditworthiness due to the role of OCC as issuer and \nguarantor of FLEX Fund options. Further, the proposed rule change would \nresult in increased competition by permitting the Exchange to offer \nproducts that are currently used in the OTC market.\n    The Exchange believes that offering innovative products flows to \nthe benefit of the investing public. A robust and competitive market \nrequires that exchanges respond to member's evolving needs by \nconstantly improving their offerings. Such efforts would be stymied if \nexchanges were prohibited from offering innovative products such as the \nproposed FLEX Fund options. The Exchange does not believe that allowing \nFLEX Fund options would render the marketplace for equity options more \nsusceptible to manipulative practices.\n    Finally, the Exchange represents that it has an adequate \nsurveillance program in place to detect manipulative trading in FLEX \nFund options. Regarding the proposed FLEX Fund options, the Exchange \nwould use the same surveillance procedures currently utilized for FLEX \nOptions listed on the Exchange (as well as for non-FLEX Fund options). \nFor surveillance purposes, the Exchange would have access to \ninformation regarding trading activity in BTC and BITB (the underlying \nETFs).\\57\\ In light of surveillance measures related to both options \ntrading on each Fund the underlying Funds, the Exchange believes that \nexisting surveillance procedures are designed to deter and detect \npossible manipulative behavior which might potentially arise from \nlisting and trading the proposed FLEX Fund options.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\57\\ See Fund Options Approval Order, 89 FR at 84966-68 \n(regarding surveillance procedures applicable to BTC, BITB, and \nother funds that hold bitcoin).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act.\n    Position Limits. The Exchange believes that its proposal to remove \nthe 25,000-contract position and exercise limit on BTC and BITB \noptions, thus allowing such limits for each Fund to increase, will not \nburden intra-market competition because it applies to all market \nparticipants that trade (or want to trade) BTC and BITB options. The \nExchange believes the proposal would provide additional opportunities \nfor market participants to continue to efficiently achieve their \ninvestment and trading objectives for equity options on the Exchange. \nThe Exchange expects that all option exchanges will adopt substantively \nsimilar proposals for adopting the additional position limit tiers, \nsuch that the Exchange's proposal would benefit competition. For these \nreasons, the Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change \nwill impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act.\n    FLEX Fund Options. The Exchange believes that the proposal to \npermit FLEX Fund options will not impose any burden on intra-market \ncompetition as all market participants can opt to utilize this product \nor not. The proposed rule change is designed to allow investors seeking \noption exposure to bitcoin to trade FLEX Fund options. Moreover, the \nExchange believes that the proposal to permit FLEX Fund options would\n\n[[Page 22138]]\n\nbroaden the base of investors that use FLEX Options to manage their \ntrading and investment risk, including investors that currently trade \nin the OTC market for customized options. The Exchange believes that \nthe proposed FLEX Fund options will not impose any burden on inter-\nmarket competition but will instead encourage competition by increasing \nthe variety of options products available for trading on the Exchange, \nwhich products will provide a valuable tool for investors to manage \nrisk. Should this proposal be approved, competing options exchanges \nwill be free to offer products like the proposed FLEX Fund options.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIV.

Statutory and Regulatory Provisions\n\n    The legislative framework generally referred to as the BSA consists \nof the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970,\\1\\ as \namended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of \n2001 (USA PATRIOT Act),\\2\\ and other legislation, including the Anti-\nMoney Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act).\\3\\ The BSA is codified at 12 \nU.S.C. 1829b, and 1951-1960; 31 U.S.C. 5311-5314, and 5316-5336, \nincluding notes thereto; with implementing regulations at 31 CFR \nchapter X.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Title II of Public Law 91-508, 84 Stat. 1118 (Oct. 26, \n1970).\n    \\2\\ Public Law 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (Oct. 26, 2001).\n    \\3\\ The AML Act was enacted as Division F, sections 6001-6511, \nof the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2021, Public Law 116-283, 134 Stat. 3388 (Jan. \n1, 2021).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The BSA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to, \ninter alia, require financial institutions to keep records and file \nreports that are determined to have a high degree of usefulness in \ncriminal, tax, or regulatory matters, risk assessments or proceedings, \nor in intelligence or counter-intelligence activities, including \nanalysis, to protect against terrorism, and to implement anti-money \nlaundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) programs and \ncompliance procedures.\\4\\ The Secretary has delegated to the Director \nof FinCEN (Director) the authority to administer the BSA.\\5\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See 31 U.S.C. 5311(1)-(2).\n    \\5\\ Treasury Order 180-01 (Reaffirmed Jan. 14, 2020); see also \n31 U.S.C. 310(b)(2)(I) (providing that the Director of FinCEN shall \n``[a]dminister the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of \nthis title, chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91-508, and section \n21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to the extent delegated \nsuch authority by the Secretary.'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Secretary is authorized to require any ``resident or citizen of \nthe United States or a person in, and doing business in, the United \nStates, to keep records, file reports, or keep records and file \nreports, when the resident, citizen, or person makes a transaction or \nmaintains a relation for any person with a foreign financial agency.'' \n\\6\\ The term ``foreign financial agency'' \\7\\ (FFA) applies to an \naction outside the United States of a ``financial agency,'' which the \nstatute defines as ``a person acting for a person . . . as a financial \ninstitution, bailee, depository trustee, or agent, or acting in a \nsimilar way related to money, credit, securities, gold, a transaction \nin money, credit, securities or gold, or a service provided with \nrespect to money, securities, futures, precious metals, stones and \njewels, or value that substitutes for currency.'' \\8\\ The Secretary is \nalso authorized to prescribe exemptions to the reporting requirement \nand to prescribe other matters the Secretary considers necessary to \ncarry out 31 U.S.C. 5314.\\9\\ The regulations implementing these \nauthorities to require reports of transactions with FFAs are found at \n31 CFR 1010.360.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ 31 U.S.C. 5314(a).\n    \\7\\ 31 U.S.C. 5312(b)(2).\n    \\8\\ See 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(1) as amended by 6102 (d)(1)(A) of the \nAML Act.

If the regulation \nis not published in the Federal Register, then any financial \ninstitution subject to the regulation must be named and personally \nserved or otherwise given actual notice in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \n553(b). If a financial institution is given notice of a reporting \nrequirement by means other than publication in the Federal Register, \nthe Secretary may prohibit disclosure of the existence or provisions \nof that reporting requirement to the designated FFA(s) and to any \nother party.

However, the Secretary may authorize a designated \nfinancial institution to report in a different manner if the \ninstitution demonstrates to the Secretary that the form of the required \nreport is unnecessarily burdensome on the institution as prescribed; \nthat a report in a different form will provide all the information the \nSecretary deems necessary; and that submission of the information in a \ndifferent manner will not unduly hinder the effective administration of \n31 CFR chapter X.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ See 31 CFR 1010.360(d).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to 31 CFR 1010.360(e), the Secretary: (i) in issuing FFA \nRegulations must consider the need to avoid impeding or controlling the \nexport or import of monetary instruments and the need to avoid \nburdening unreasonably a person making a transaction with a designated \nFFA; (ii) must not issue an FFA Regulation for the purpose of obtaining \nindividually identifiable account information concerning a customer, as \ndefined by the Right to Financial Privacy Act,\\21\\ where that customer \nis already the subject of an ongoing investigation for possible \nviolation of the BSA, or is known by the Secretary to be the subject of \nan investigation for possible violation of any other Federal law; and \n(iii) may issue an FFA Regulation requiring a financial institution to \nreport transactions completed prior to the date it received notice of \nthe reporting requirement. However, with respect to completed \ntransactions, a financial institution may be required to provide \ninformation only from records required to be maintained pursuant to the \nrequirements of 31 CFR chapter X, or any other provision of state or \nFederal law, or otherwise maintained in the regular course of \nbusiness.\\22\\ All records that are required to be retained by chapter X \nshall be retained for a period of five years, including those records \nrequired to be created under 31 CFR 1010.360.\\23\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ 12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.\n    \\22\\ See 31 CFR 1010.360(e)(1) through (3).\n    \\23\\ 31 CFR 1010.430(d).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nII.

The Board of Governors of the\n  Federal Reserve System Master Account and Services Database contains\n  data on financial institutions that utilize Federal Reserve Bank\n  financial services, including those with no FFR. FinCEN used this data\n  to identify 395 banks and credit unions with no FFR that are utilizing\n  Federal Reserve Bank financial services.\n\\d\\ See 31 CFR 1010.100(t)(2).\n\\e\\ This estimate is based on Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\n  data on active broker-dealers which listed 3,306 active broker-dealers\n  registered with the SEC as of Apr. 29, 2025.

The topline value for all\n  MSBs represents the average number of uniquely identifiable registered\n  MSBs with indicia of ongoing operations as of the three year-ends 2022-\n  2024, and primarily includes only principal MSBs required to register\n  with FinCEN. FinCEN believes that the reporting and recordkeeping\n  obligations this regulation imposes on MSBs will fall overwhelmingly\n  on principals rather than their agents, but FinCEN is interested in\n  any comments the public may have on this position. FinCEN has\n  estimated that the number of agent MSBs is approximately 229,161 and\n  invites public comment on this figure as well. See FinCEN, Agency\n  Information Collection Activities; Proposed Renewal; Comment Request;\n  Renewal Without Change of Regulations Requiring Records To Be Made and\n  Retained by Financial Institutions, Banks, and Providers and Sellers\n  of Prepaid Access, 89 FR 65971 (Aug. 13, 2024).\n\\h\\ See 31 CFR 1010.100(ff)(1).\ni This value represents the number of uniquely identifiable registered\n  MSBs with indicia of ongoing operations as of year-end 2024 that self-\n  identified as either ``Currency Dealer or Exchanger'' (FinCEN Form\n  107, Code 407) or ``Dealer in Foreign Exchange'' (FinCEN Form 107,\n  Code 415).

To the extent\n  that additional data can better inform this estimate, public comment\n  including provision of such data is invited.\n\\bb\\ See 31 CFR 1010.100(t)(8-9).\n\\cc\\ The number of futures commissions merchants as of May 2025 was\n  obtained from data available at NFA Membership and Registration,\n  available at <a href=\"https://www.nfa.futures.org/registration-membership/membership-and-directories.html\">https://www.nfa.futures.org/registration-membership/membership-and-directories.html</a>. This estimate may include some\n  entities registered in both categories, but FinCEN believes this\n  figure to be small. According to the Commodity Futures Trading\n  Commission (CFTC), as of Mar. 31, 2025, there are 63 registered\n  futures commissions merchants. See CFTC, Financial Data For CFMs,\n  available at <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/financialfcmdata/index.htm\">https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/financialfcmdata/index.htm</a>.\n\\dd\\ See 31 CFR 1010.100(t)(10).\n\\ee\\ According to the SEC, as of the fourth quarter of 2024, in 2024\n  there were 2,764 open-end registered investment companies that report\n  on Form N-CEN. (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/form-ncen-data-sets\">https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/form-ncen-data-sets</a>).\n\n    While the entities in Table 1 are subject to FFA Regulations as \ndescribed above, FinCEN typically issues FFA Regulations to a \nsignificantly smaller subset of the eligible population. From 2022 to \n2025, FinCEN generally issued FFA Regulations to banks and broker-\ndealers as defined in Table 1. Among these, FinCEN required reports \nfrom an average of 15 unique institutions per year. FinCEN has applied \nhistorical data on FFA Regulations to estimate the number of \nrespondents per year. The estimated number of expected respondents per \nyear is based on the average number of respondents per FFA Regulation \nissued over the three-year period from 2022 to 2025 multiplied by the \naverage number of FFA Regulations issued per year over the same period.\n    Estimated Number of Expected Respondents: 40 domestic financial \ninstitutions, annually on average.\\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ Because the same respondent may be subject to reporting \nrequirements under more than one issued regulation in the same \ncalendar year, the estimated number of expected respondents may \nexceed the number of unique entities to whom reporting and \nrecordkeeping burdens would accrue. See infra discussion below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    FinCEN is revising its estimate of expected respondents upward to \nreflect an increase in the quantity of FFA Regulations issued and an \nincrease in the average number of financial institutions directed to \nrespond to each such FFA Regulation since the most recent previous OMB \ncontrol number renewal. In the three calendar-year period between 2019 \nand 2022, FinCEN issued four FFA Regulations to an average of nine \ncovered financial institutions per regulation.\\26\\ During the analogous \nthree-year period between 2022 and 2025, FinCEN issued 11 FFA \nRegulations (about four per year) to an average of ten covered \nfinancial institutions per regulation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\26\\ See FinCEN, ``Agency Information Collection Activities; \nProposed Renewal; Comment Request; Renewal Without Change of Reports \nof Transactions With Foreign Financial Agencies'', 87 FR 1479 (Jan. \n11, 2022), n. 10 and 11.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Estimated Total Annual Responses: 40 responses.\\27\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\27\\ The estimated number of annual responses is based on the \nexpectation that each newly issued regulation would engender one \nresponse per respondent, consisting of three reports (one initial \nand two subsequent), and is based on the average number of \nregulations issued per calendar year over the most recent three \nyears multiplied by the average number of respondents per regulation \nissued during the same period. See discussion below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    FinCEN is also revising the structure of its burden estimates to \nenhance comparability and tractability across the activities a covered \nfinancial institution is expected to undertake in compliance with 31 \nCFR 1010.360. The downward revision in the estimated total annual \nresponses in this renewal (40), as compared to the most recent previous \nestimate (84), does not reflect an expected decrease in responses, but \nrather a change in what a `response' is intended to represent.\n    In formulating its estimates of reporting and recordkeeping burdens \nfor this OMB control renewal, FinCEN anticipates that each FFA \nRegulation will require information from one or more respondents who \nwould consequently incur incremental reporting and recordkeeping \nobligations unique to the regulation. Each respondent would be required \nto provide FinCEN with a response in the form of a report, or reports, \nwith respect to each of the FFAs identified in the regulation. In prior \nrenewals, FinCEN has referred to, and treated each of the reports \nprovided to comply with an issued regulation as an individual response, \nand because the number of reports and the time-period covered by each \nreport required has historically varied by regulation issued, this made \nthe exercise of mapping respondents to responses to per-response burden \nfor purposes of cost estimations less tractable and less likely to \nmeaningfully represent the manner in which respondents view and \noperationalize their compliance activities. While the historical \nanalysis below retains individual reports as the fundamental unit of \nanalysis, for purposes of estimating PRA burdens, FinCEN is employing a \nstandardized model that treats the sum total of reports a respondent \nprovides to FinCEN as one response, composed of three notional reports, \none that captures a more extensive, costly ``initial report,'' and \nrepresents all follow-on reporting as two ``subsequent reports'' of \nshorter length and lower associated costs (i.e., ``subsequent reports'' \nafter the initial report).\n    In calendar years 2022-2024, FinCEN issued a total of 11 FFA \nRegulations--approximately four per year. The FFA Regulations required \nthat financial institutions respond with information on one to 308 FFAs \nper request, with an average of 50 FFAs per regulation.\n    Four annual FFA Regulations multiplied by 50 FFAs per regulations \nequals 200 FFAs per year per respondent. During this period, there was \none FFA Regulation that included 308 FFAs, which is significantly \nlarger than the number of FFAs per regulation when compared to other \nFFA Regulations issued during the same period. Excluding that instance, \nthe average number of FFAs per regulation was approximately 25 (24.4). \nFinCEN believes that instance to be an outlier. However, to maintain a \nconservative estimate, FinCEN has retained the higher figure of 50 FFAs \nper regulation.\n    Although FFA Regulations require about 200 reports per respondent \nper year, each response requires multiple reports that are sent at \ndifferent times. The initial report will include transactions that \noccurred over a specified ``look-back'' period. Each subsequent report \nwill include transactions that have occurred since the initial report \n(if it is the first subsequent report) or since the most recent prior \nreport (if it is not the first subsequent report). In general, initial \nreports are more burdensome because they typically require more data \nand initial research. Across the 11 FFA Regulations issued during the \nthree-year period from 2022-2025, seven have been completed,\\28\\ and \nthe resulting reports contained an average of approximately ten million \ntotal rows of data, with the initial report containing an average of \napproximately 60 percent of this volume.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ Several FFA Regulations from 2024 and 2025 are still \nongoing.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22161]]\n\n    During the three-year period from 2022 to 2025, the average look-\nback period per request was 737 days, which is approximately 24 months. \nFinCEN assesses that this is representative of the duration of the \nlook-back period in future requests.\\29\\ FinCEN estimates that the \ninitial report, requiring a look-back over an average two-year period, \nwill take approximately 16 hours (two business days) for initial \nresearch, approval by management, and reporting (i.e. transmission), \nwhich includes setting up a template for subsequent reporting.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ This range can vary, particularly when ``renewing'' an FFA \nRegulation. In such cases, FinCEN asks respondents to ``look-back'' \nover a shorter period, generally one to three months to the last \ncollection on the associated FFAs. In such cases, initial reporting \nburden will be smaller. FinCEN applies a conservative estimate for \nthe purposes of estimating burden here, assuming FFAs that are the \nsubject of a regulation are initial FFA Regulations with no \nimmediate precedent.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Over the same period, the number of subsequent reporting periods \nper FFA Regulation ranged from seven to 14, with an average of ten. The \nsubsequent reports were always required over a period of 180 days. \nHowever, beginning in 2025 and for future FFA Regulations, FinCEN \nintends to require a smaller number of subsequent reporting periods, \nwith as few as two per regulation, as appropriate. This approach will \nresult in an average number of three reports per regulation under this \nframework: the initial report (including look-back), and two subsequent \nreports. FinCEN estimates that each subsequent report (an expected \naverage of two in total) will take approximately two hours (one hour \nfor data gathering and one hour for approval and reporting).\n    Estimated Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden: 40,500 hours, as set \nout in Table 2, below.\n    FinCEN considers the primary burden to be associated with the \npreparation of required reports, which it anticipates may potentially \ninvolve multiple stages of processing and review by respondents and/or \ntheir need to access multiple data systems, depending on the scope or \ncomplexity of the regulation or the nature of a given FFA.\n    Generally, the information required to be reported pursuant to an \nFFA Regulation is basic information that a domestic financial \ninstitution must already maintain to comply with current BSA \nrecordkeeping requirements. For example, a domestic financial \ninstitution sending or receiving transmittal orders (funds transfers) \nwith a designated FFA would have access to the information required to \nbe reported. The information required to be reported pursuant to an FFA \nRegulation falls into one or more of the following categories: (i) \nchecks or drafts; (ii) transmittal orders; (iii) loans; (iv) commercial \npaper; (v) stocks; (vi) bonds; and (vii) certificates of deposit. \nAlthough FFA Regulations may concern any of these types of \ntransactions, in general, over the past three years, FinCEN has only \npromulgated regulations associated with funds transfers. As noted \nabove, FinCEN will specify the form and method for reporting and \ntypically provides a reporting schedule to each specified financial \ninstitution. If a specified financial institution does not have any \nreportable transactions, that information must be reported to FinCEN.\n    FinCEN also requires that filers maintain records of data reported \npursuant to FFA Regulations. The FFA information is typically reported \nby uploading a comma-separated value file spreadsheet through FinCEN's \nSecure Information Sharing System, which allows the filer to save an \nelectronic version of the report and satisfy the recordkeeping \nrequirement. FinCEN estimates that the recordkeeping requirement will \ntake five minutes on average.\n    Table 2 provides a summary of the total expected annual burden \nhours for all FFA Regulations.\n\n                     Table 2--Burden Associated With Each Portion of the Annual PRA Estimate\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Expected\n                                                  number of     Expected     Expected     Average       Total\n                    Activity                         FFA       number of    frequency      burden       annual\n                                                 regulations   respondent      per       hours per      burden\n                                                    issued                  respondent   provision      hours\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFiling initial report(s) \\a\\ of certain                    4           10            1          800       32,000\n transactions with designated FFAs \\b\\.........\nFiling subsequent reports of certain                                                 2          100        8,000\n transactions with designated FFAs.............\nComplying with recordkeeping requirements that                                       3        \\d\\ 4          500\n apply to reports \\c\\..........................\n                                                ----------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total......................................  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........       40,500\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\a\\ The burden calculations in this table contemplate that the average number of FFAs per regulation issued is\n  50, each of which would require its own report, and would thereby incur the following burden hours per report:\n  16 (initial report), 2 (subsequent reports), and 1/12 (recordkeeping).\n\\b\\ The filing of an initial report includes the applicable look-back period and includes the burden associated\n  with operationalizing the reporting format specified by FinCEN.\n\\c\\ Records associated with the reports produced in response to regulations issued pursuant to 31 CFR 1010.360\n  are subject to the requirements in 31 CFR 1010.430.\n\\d\\ Rounded to the nearest whole number (four) from approximately 4.2 (50 x 1/12 = ~ 4.167).\n\n    In the previous renewal of this OMB control number, FinCEN revised \nits estimate of burden in response to comments received,\\30\\ which \ndescribed a range of required response times for FFA Regulations of \nvarying complexity.\\31\\ In that renewal, FinCEN proposed three \ncategories of FFA Regulation: simple regulations (25% of total request, \ntaking seven hours total per response on average), typical regulations \n(50% of total requests, taking 100 hours total per response on \naverage), and complex regulations (25% of total requests, taking 360 \nhours per response on average). The weighted average response time for \nthese regulation categories is 141.75 hours in total. Between 2019 and \n2021 (the period before the comment letter was submitted), FinCEN FFA \nRegulations sought information on an average of seven FFAs per \nregulation. As discussed above, FinCEN has also historically\n\n[[Page 22162]]\n\nrequired seven subsequent reports before the recent change (where going \nforward, FinCEN expects to only require two subsequent reports in most \nFFA Regulations). Using this methodology in combination with the \nrevised time estimates laid out in Table 2, the initial report for the \npast period (2022-2025) would be estimated to require 112 hours (16 \nhours per 7 FFAs, conducted one time) and the subsequent reports are \nestimated to take 98 hours (two hours per 7 FFAs, conducted seven times \non average), for a total of 210 hours on average per FFA Regulation. \nHowever, because subsequent reports were more frequent during this \nperiod, and therefore involved smaller data files, the corresponding \nsubsequent report time for this period would be closer to one hour per \nFFA (instead of two hours per FFA). Applying this equivalence results \nin a total estimated average time of 161 hours per FFA Regulation \nduring 2022-2025, which is a close approximation of the weighted \naverage time per FFA Regulation from the previous renewal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ See FinCEN, ``Agency Information Collection Activities; \nProposed Renewal; Comment Request; Renewal Without Change of Reports \nof Transactions With Foreign Financial Agencies,'' 87 FR 1479 (Jan. \n11, 2022). See also the information collection request documents, \nincluding the supporting statement for the 2022 renewal at <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=202203-1506-001\">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=202203-1506-001</a>.\n    \\31\\ See the public comment in response to the 2022 renewal at \n<a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=202203-1506-001\">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=202203-1506-001</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Using the figures from Table 2, the average total time per request \nanticipated by this renewal is 1,000 hours (an initial report taking 16 \nhours per FFA for 50 FFAs on average, plus two subsequent reports \ntaking two hours per FFA for 50 FFAs on average). This increase is \nlargely the result of the previous period (2022-2025) including several \nhighly complex requests involving significantly more FFAs than were \nincluded in prior years' FFA Regulations. As discussed above, during \nthis period there was an FFA Regulation that included 308 FFAs. \nExcluding that instance, the average number of FFAs per FFA Regulation \nwas approximately 25 (24.4). While this previous period may therefore \nbe exceptional, and therefore of limited predictive value for future \nexpectations, FinCEN is not removing outliers from its estimates to \ntake a more conservative approach to assessing the burden of issuing \nregulations. Using the figure of 25 FFAs per regulation results in an \nexpected average total time per regulation of 500 hours, which is \napproximately equivalent to the upper end of the typical range \ndescribed by the commenter for the 2019-2021 period.\n    Estimated Total Annual Recordkeeping Cost: The estimated total \nannual PRA cost is $4,860,000, as set out in Table 3.\n    To estimate the costs associated with the annual PRA burden hours, \nFinCEN is utilizing a fully loaded composite hourly wage rate of \n$120.07, or rounded to the nearest dollar, $120.00.\\32\\ The total \nestimated cost of the annual PRA burden is reflected in Table 3 below:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ The wage rate applied here is a general composite hourly \nwage ($85.55), scaled by a private-sector benefits factor of 1.42 \n($120.07 = $85.55 x 1.42), that incorporates the mean wage data \nprovided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) associated with the \nsix occupational codes (11-1010: Chief Executives; 11-3021: Computer \nand Information Systems Managers; 11-3031: Financial Managers; 13-\n1041: Compliance Officers; 23-1010: Lawyers and Judicial Law Clerks; \n43-3099: Financial Clerks, All Other) for each of the nine groupings \nof NAICS industry codes that FinCEN determined are most directly \ncomparable to its eleven categories of covered financial \ninstitutions as delineated in 31 CFR parts 1020-1030. See BLS, \nOccupational Employment and Wage Statistics Tables, ``May 2023--\nNational industry-specific and by ownership,'' available at <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm</a>. The benefit factor is 1 plus the \nbenefit/wages ratio. As of June 2023, Total Benefits = 29.4 and \nWages and Salaries = 70.6 (29.4/70.6= 0.42) based on the BLS' \nPrivate Industry Workers Series data. See BLS, News Release, \n``Employer Costs for Employee Compensation--June 2023,'' available \nat <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_09122023.pdf\">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_09122023.pdf</a>. \nBecause many employers provide non-wage benefits (e.g., insurance, \npaid leave), the private sector benefit is applied to reflect the \ntotal cost to the employer.\n\n                               Table 3--Estimated Total Cost of Annual PRA Burden\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          Activity \\a\\                             Burden hours      Wage rate      Total cost\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFiling initial reports of certain transactions with designated            32,000            $120      $3,840,000\n FFAs...........................................................\nFiling subsequent reports of certain transactions with                     8,000                         960,000\n designated FFAs................................................\nComplying with the recordkeeping requirements in 31 CFR 1010.430             500                          60,000\n                                                                 -----------------------------------------------\n    Total annual cost...........................................  ..............  ..............       4,860,000\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\a\\ See respective activities in Table 2.\n\n    Under the PRA, FinCEN as a Federal agency may not conduct or \nsponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of \ninformation unless the collection of information displays a valid OMB \ncontrol number.

All \ncomments will become a matter of public record.\n    General Request for Comments--Comments are invited on: (1) whether \nthe collection of information is necessary for the proper performance \nof the functions of the agency, including whether the information shall \nhave practical utility; (2) the accuracy of FinCEN's estimates of the \nburden of the collection of information; (3) ways to enhance the \nquality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; (4) \nways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on \nrespondents, including through the use of automated collection \ntechniques or other forms of information technology; and (5) estimates \nof capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and \npurchase of services to provide information.\n    Additional Requests for Comment--In connection with a variety of \ninitiatives FinCEN is undertaking to implement the AML Act, FinCEN \nintends to conduct, in the future, additional assessments of the PRA \nburden associated with BSA requirements. To assist with those \nactivities, FinCEN is also requesting comments in response to the \nfollowing additional questions:\n    (1) As noted above, FinCEN data indicates that initial reporting \nvolume requires significantly more research and templating than the \nsubsequent reports. FinCEN estimated 16 hours for initial reports and \ntwo hours each for subsequent reports. Does this distribution of \nexpected burden hours reflect how responses to FFA Regulations are \nexecuted? If not, how long does it take a firm on average to provide an \ninitial report and each subsequent report? Are there any factors that \naffect this time burden that would improve FinCEN's estimates of burden \nor costs?\n    (2) FinCEN's burden analysis recognizes that there may be \ntechnology costs associated with reporting and storing transaction \ndata. Are these incremental costs readily quantifiable? If so, how much \nare they expected to vary by respondent? Do they differ in\n\n[[Page 22163]]\n\nrelative or absolute value for smaller respondents?\n\nAndrea M.

OMB previously approved the \ncollection of information under control number 3041-0029. OMB's most \nrecent extension of approval will expire on May 31, 2025. On February \n27, 2025, CPSC published a notice in the Federal Register to announce \nthe agency's intention to seek extension of approval of the collection \nof information. The Commission received four comments.

CPSC conducts continuing studies \nand investigations of deaths, injuries, diseases, other health \nimpairments, and economic losses resulting from incidents involving \nconsumer products. CPSC obtains information about product-related \ndeaths, injuries, and illnesses from a variety of sources, including \nnews outlets, death certificates, consumer complaints, and medical \nfacilities. In addition, CPSC operates the National Electronic Injury \nSurveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on consumer product-related \ninjuries treated in hospital emergency departments in the United \nStates. CPSC also uses the NEISS system to collect information on \nchildhood poisonings in accordance with the Poison Prevention Packaging \nAct of 1970.\n    From these sources, the CPSC selects cases of interest for further \ninvestigation by contacting individuals who witnessed or were injured \nin incidents involving consumer products. These investigations are \nconducted on-site (face-to-face), by telephone, or by the internet. \nThis information is also collected by contacting state and local \nofficials, including police, coroners and fire investigators, and \nothers with knowledge of the incident.\n    CPSC uses the information from this collection to support \ndevelopment and improvement of voluntary standards; proceedings for the \ndevelopment of mandatory standards and regulations; information and \neducation campaigns; and administrative and judicial proceedings for \nenforcement of the statutes, standards, and regulations administered by \nthe agency. The information collected informs the\n\n[[Page 22067]]\n\nagency in its efforts to remove unsafe products from channels of \ndistribution and consumers' homes, and it provides information to the \npublic about the safety of consumer products.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Through Interagency Agreements, the CPSC also has used and \ncan use the NEISS system to collect information on injuries for the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (NEISS All Injury \nProgram (NEISS-AIP)). In addition to the standard data variables \nthat have been collected and can be collected on all NEISS injuries, \nthe NEISS-AIP collects additional variables on several studies for \nCDC (Firearm-Related Injuries, Adverse Drug Events, Assaults, and \nSelf- Inflicted Violence) and one study on non-crash motor vehicle-\nrelated injuries for the National Highway and Transportation Safety \nAdministration (NHTSA).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Estimated Number of Respondents: CPSC estimates a total number of \n3,110 respondents, annually. CPSC estimates 160 respondents to NEISS, \nwhich includes hospitals that directly report information to NEISS and \nhospitals that allow access to a CPSC contractor who collects the data \nfor NEISS. CPSC estimates 2,950 individual respondents expected to be \ninterviewed by CPSC for further investigations of reported cases.\n    Estimated Time per Response: All NEISS data are reported \nelectronically and NEISS coders directly submit data to CPSC through \nthe internet on a CPSC-developed application called WebNEISS. The NEISS \ncoders review an estimated 4.5 million emergency department charts \nannually. Each chart review requires approximately 30 seconds to review \nand determine if the record is reportable. On average, the 1.15 million \nreportable records take 2 minutes each to enter into WebNEISS. Records \nthat qualify for a special study take an additional 90 seconds to 2 \nminutes to code. Collecting emergency department records for review, \ncorrecting error messages, and other tasks takes between 2.5 and 6 \nhours weekly. Respondents also spend about 8-36 hours per year \nparticipating in related activities (training, evaluations, and \ncommunicating with other hospital staff). The average burden per \nrespondent is 720 hours. However, the total burden hours on each \nrespondent varies, due to differences in the sizes of the hospitals \n(e.g., small rural hospitals versus large metropolitan hospitals). The \nsmallest hospital will report an estimated 250 cases with a burden of \nabout 150 hours, while the largest hospital will report an estimated \n65,000 cases with a burden of about 4,500 hours.\n    Information for follow-up investigations from NEISS and other \nsources is collected through traditional face-to-face, telephone, or \ninternet-based interviews with consumers, witnesses, and other \nknowledgeable parties, such as fire, police, and healthcare \nprofessionals. On average, an on-site interview takes about 4.5 hours. \nCPSC staff also complete about 750 in-depth investigations (IDIs) by \ntelephone through the use of a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview \n(CATI) or self-administered Computer Assisted Internet Interviews \n(CAII) questionnaires. Each CATI or CAII IDI requires about 20 minutes \nto complete. CPSC estimates 13,523 annual burden hours on these \nrespondents: 13,275 hours for face-to-face interviews and 248 hours for \nin-depth telephone or internet interviews.\n    Total Estimated Annual Burden: Table 1 summarizes the burden of the \ncollection. The total estimated annualized burden to respondents is \n128,523 hours (115,248 for NEISS respondents and 13,523 for \nindividuals).\n\n                                         Table 1--Average Annual Burden\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                    Burden per\n                                    Respondents      Frequency       Responses       response      Total burden\n                                                                                     (minutes)        (hours)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNEISS...........................             160           7,188       1,150,000             6.0         115,000\nOther Respondents...............           2,950               1           2,950           275.0          13,523\n                                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total.......................           3,110             371       1,152,950             6.7         128,523\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Total Estimated Annual Cost to Respondents: The total costs to \nNEISS respondents are estimated at approximately $6.9 million. NEISS \nrespondents enter into contracts with CPSC and are compensated for \nthese costs. The average cost per respondent is estimated to be about \n$43,000. The average cost per burden hour is estimated to be $60 per \nhour (including wages and overhead). However, the actual cost to each \nrespondent varies due to the type of respondent (hospital versus CPSC \ncontractor), size of hospital, and regional differences in wages and \noverhead. Therefore, the actual annual cost for any given respondent \nmay vary between $3,000 at a small rural hospital, and $550,000 at the \nlargest metropolitan hospital.\n    CPSC estimates the value of the time required for reporting by \nother respondents to be $46.84 an hour, the average cost for employee \ncompensation for civilian workers (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, \n``Employer Costs for Employee Compensation,'' September 2024: <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_12172024.pdf\">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_12172024.pdf</a>). At this \nvaluation, the estimated annual cost to the public is about $633,417 \n(13,523 burden hours x $46.84 per hour = $633,417.32).\n    Response to Public Comments: The Commission received four public \ncomments. Three commenters, two anonymous and one from ASTM \nInternational Committee F15 on Consumer Products, expressed support for \nthe renewal of information collection, with one anonymous commenter \nsuggesting that the Commission utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to \nenhance information gathering and analysis. With the implementation of \nWebNEISS in 2024, CPSC integrated AI into the NEISS data collection to \nidentify potential misentries based on logical inconsistencies. CPSC \nstaff continue to explore, test, implement, and utilize advanced AI in \nall phases of the NEISS data collection, processing, and dissemination.\n    The remaining commenter is Best Practice Quality LLC, which states \nit is a consulting firm. It recommended expanding the data fields to \ninclude product identifiers, usage context, and product condition to \nimprove the quality and utility of NEISS data. It encouraged CPSC to \nprovide prompts to hospital personnel to capture details about product \ninvolvement. It also encouraged the use of modern technologies to \nreduce reporting burden while providing accuracy. In addition, it \nencouraged collaboration with stakeholders to refine the data taxonomy \nand align NEISS inputs with evolving product safety standards.\n\n[[Page 22068]]\n\n    NEISS is a voluntary program that relies on existing medical \nrecords information collected by hospital emergency departments using \ntheir existing infrastructure. Doctors, nurses, and intake personnel \nnote what occurred that led to the injury, which often includes the \nmention of a consumer product, however, they rarely capture product \nbrand names and models in their work as such information is rarely \nrelevant to patient care. The narratives will sometimes describe \nwhether a product was new or used, and the way the product was \ninvolved, to provide usage context. CPSC makes efforts to encourage \nmedical staff at NEISS hospitals to include consumer product \ninformation in their records documentation, but the staff in the \nhospital departments ultimately decide what will go into the medical \nrecord which exists primarily for the hospital and its patients.\n    CPSC does not include brands or models in the data it shares \npublicly with ASTM due to restrictions in section 6(b) of the Consumer \nProduct Safety Act. 15 U.S.C. 2055(b). With regard to the use of modern \ntechnologies, as mentioned above, CPSC uses AI-assisted logic in the \nuse of its internet-enabled application to collect data.\n    Making changes to data taxonomy is done judiciously, as one of the \nfunctions of NEISS is to be able to detect changes over time to \ndetermine whether safety advances and interventions have been \nsuccessful and to what degree. Agency staff meets regularly to discuss \ncoding practices, including adding or altering product codes to account \nfor changes in the products associated with injuries. Staff assigned to \nvoluntary standards work have contributed to these deliberations, which \nhas led to changes as needed.\n\nAlberta E. Mills,\nSecretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09251 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6355-01-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

The regulations subpart D are obsolete and unnecessary because \nThe Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 eliminated mandatory \ngrading of types of tobacco eligible for price support programs and a \nreferendum of eligible producers voted in favor of terminating the \ndesignations for tobacco auction markets in June of 2005.\n\nDATES: The final rule is effective July 21, 2025.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Angie Snyder, Deputy Administrator, \nUSDA-AMS-Cotton and Tobacco Program, 3275 Appling Road, Memphis, TN \n38133; Telephone: (901) 384-3000; Email: <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6e0f0009070b401d00170a0b1c2e1b1d0a0f40090118\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"a1c0cfc6c8c48fd2cfd8c5c4d3e1d4d2c5c08fc6ced7\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of \n2004 (sec. 611(b), Pub. L. 108-357, 118 Stat. 1522; Oct. 22, 2004) \neliminated the price support and quota system for tobacco produced in \nthe United States and eliminates mandatory grading of types of tobacco \neligible for price support programs. Under the Tobacco Inspection Act \n(ch. 623, sec. 9, 49 Stat. 733; Aug. 23, 1935), mandatory Federal \ngrading of any tobacco sold at auction on a designated market would \ncontinue only if growers supported the designation of existing tobacco \nauctions markets for the purpose of mandatory grading.\n    Under the Tobacco Inspection Act (7 U.S.C. 511d), the Secretary is \nauthorized to designate those auction markets where tobacco is bought \nand sold thereon at auction. Once tobacco markets are designated by the \nSecretary, no tobacco may be offered for sale at auction on such market \nuntil it has been inspected and certified by an authorized \nrepresentative of the Secretary. It also provides that, before any \nmarket is designated, the Secretary is required to determine by \nreferendum the desire of tobacco growers who sold tobacco at auction on \nsuch market during the preceding marketing season.\n    A referendum (70 FR 20724; April 21, 2005), requested by the \nNational Advisory Committee for Tobacco Inspection Services, was \nconducted May 9 through 13, 2005, to determine if tobacco producers \nfavored termination of designations for the auction markets, thus \neliminating the requirement for mandatory Federal inspection. The \nreferendum results, announced on June 15, 2005, showed 57 percent of \nthe producers of flue-cured tobacco, burley tobacco, Kentucky-Tennessee \nfire cured tobacco, Virginia fire-cured tobacco, Virginia sun-cured \ntobacco, and dark air-cured tobacco voted in favor of terminating the \nmarket designations. A vote by a simple majority of eligible producers \nwas necessary to terminate the designations for auction markets \neffective for the 2005 and subsequent marketing seasons.\n    Given that designated tobacco markets that require mandatory \ngrading have not been active since June of 2005, there are no known \ncosts or benefits associated with USDA's regulations governing \nmandatory tobacco inspection/grading, which are contained in part 29 of \ntitle 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Currently, subpart D of 7 \nCFR part 29 includes a policy statement and a list of 188 tobacco \nmarkets designated for purposes of mandatory grading.\n    Upon reviewing these regulations, USDA has determined that subpart \nD of 7 CFR part 29 should be rescinded for the reasons stated above. To \nthe extent there is any uncertainty about the costs and benefits of \nthese regulations, it is the policy of USDA to err on the side of \nderegulation and focus resources on fairly and rationally enforcing a \ndiscrete and manageable number of regulations. USDA has determined that \nthere is no reliance interest in the regulations to be removed. \nMoreover, regardless of the lawfulness, USDA has no interest in \nmaintaining a regulation that is unnecessary for the reasons stated \nabove. The regulations in subpart D of 7 CFR part 29 are not a \npriority.\n\nList of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 29\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Advisory committees, \nGovernment publications, Imports, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements, Tobacco.\n\n    For the reasons set forth in the preamble, AMS amends 7 CFR part 29 \nas follows:\n\nPART 29--TOBACCO INSPECTION\n\n0\n1.

This \nregulatory action is needed because of changes occurring in the \nNational Airspace System. These changes are designed to provide for the \nsafe and efficient use of the navigable airspace under instrument \nconditions in the affected areas.\n\nDATES: Effective Date: 0901 UTC, June 12, 2025.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Romana B. Wolf, Manager, Flight \nProcedures and Airspace Group, Flight Technologies and Procedures \nDivision, Office of Safety Standards, Flight Standards Service, \nAviation Safety, Federal Aviation Administration. Mailing Address: FAA \nMike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Flight Procedures and Airspace \nGroup, 6500 South MacArthur Blvd., STB Annex, Bldg. 26, Room 217, \nOklahoma City, OK 73099. Telephone (405) 954-1139.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This amendment to part 95 of the Federal \nAviation Regulations (14 CFR part 95) amends, suspends, or revokes IFR \naltitudes governing the operation of all aircraft in flight over a \nspecified route or any portion of that route, as well as the changeover \npoints (COPs) for Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes as \nprescribed in part 95.\n\nThe Rule\n\n    The specified IFR altitudes, when used in conjunction with the \nprescribed changeover points for those routes, ensure navigation aid \ncoverage that is adequate for safe flight operations and free of \nfrequency interference. The reasons and circumstances that create the \nneed for this amendment involve matters of flight safety and \noperational efficiency in the National Airspace System, are related to \npublished aeronautical charts that are essential to the user and \nprovide for the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace. In \naddition, those various reasons or circumstances require making this \namendment effective before the next scheduled charting and publication \ndate of the flight information to assure its timely availability to the \nuser. The effective date of this amendment reflects those \nconsiderations. In view of the close and immediate relationship between \nthese regulatory changes and safety in air commerce, I find that notice \nand public procedure before adopting this amendment are impracticable \nand contrary to the public interest and that good cause exists for \nmaking the amendment effective in less than 30 days.\n\nConclusion\n\n    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an \nestablished body of technical regulations for which frequent and \nroutine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. \nIt, therefore--(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under \nExecutive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT \nRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); \nand (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the \nanticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA \ncertifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 95\n\n    Airspace, Navigation (air).\n\n    Issued in Washington, DC, on May 9, 2025.\nRomana B.

    "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain cut-to-length carbon-quality steel plate products (CTL plate) from the Republic of Korea (Korea). The period of review (POR) is February 1, 2023, through January 31, 2024. Commerce preliminarily finds that the producers/exporters subject to this administrative review did not make sales of subject merchandise at prices below normal value during the POR. We are rescinding this administrative review, in part, with respect to four companies. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.",

In this administrative review, we instead \nrequest that interested parties provide at the beginning of their \nbriefs a public executive summary for each issue raised in their \nbriefs.\\15\\ Further, we request that interested parties limit their \npublic executive summary of each issue to no more than 450 words, not \nincluding citations. We intend to use the public executive summaries as \nthe basis of the comment summaries included in the issues and decision \nmemorandum that will accompany the final results of this administrative \nreview.

Commerce intends to issue these rescission \ninstructions to CBP after the date of publication of this notice in the \nFederal Register.\n    The final results of this administrative review shall be the basis \nfor the assessment of antidumping duties on entries of merchandise \ncovered by the final results of this review and for future deposits of \nestimated duties, where applicable.\\22\\ We intend to issue assessment \ninstructions regarding the individually examined respondents to CBP no \nearlier than 35 days after the date of publication of the final results \nof this review in the Federal Register. If a timely summons is filed at \nthe U.S. Court of International Trade, the assessment instructions will \ndirect CBP not to liquidate relevant entries until the time for parties \nto file a request for a statutory injunction has expired (i.e., within \n90 days of publication).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ See section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCash Deposit Requirements\n\n    The following cash deposit requirements will be effective upon \npublication in the Federal Register of the notice of the final results \nof this administrative review for all shipments of subject merchandise \nentered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the \ndate of publication as provided by section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act: (1) \nthe cash deposit rate for the individually examined respondents listed \nabove will be that established in the final results of this \nadministrative review, except if the rate is less than 0.50 percent \nand, therefore, de minimis within the meaning of 19 CFR 351.106(c)(1), \nin which case the cash deposit rate will be zero; (2) for merchandise \nexported by companies not covered in this review but covered in a prior \nsegment of this proceeding, the cash deposit rate will continue to be \nthe company-specific rate published in the completed segment for the \nmost recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this \nreview, a prior review, or the investigation but the producer is, then \nthe cash deposit rate will be the rate established in the most recently \ncompleted segment for the producer of the merchandise; (4) the cash \ndeposit rate for all other producers or exporters will continue to be \n0.98 percent, the all-others rate established in the investigation.\\23\\ \nThese cash deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect \nuntil further notice.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ See, e.g., Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon-Quality Steel Plate \nProducts from the Republic of Korea: Final Results of Antidumping \nDuty Administrative Review; 2020-2021, 87 FR 40489, 40490 (July 7, \n2022).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotification to Importers\n\n    This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their \nresponsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate \nregarding the reimbursement of antidumping and/or countervailing duties \nprior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this POR. Failure \nto comply with this requirement could result in Commerce's presumption \nthat reimbursement of antidumping and/or countervailing duties occurred \nand the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties, and/or an \nincrease in the amount of antidumping duties by the amount of \ncountervailing duties.\n\nNotification to Interested Parties\n\n    Commerce is issuing and publishing these preliminary results in \naccordance with sections 751(a)(1) and 777(i)(1) of the Act, 19 CFR \n351.213 and 19 CFR 351.221(b)(4).\n\n    Dated: May 16, 2025.\nScot Fullerton,\nActing Deputy Assistant Secretary for Antidumping and Countervailing \nDuty Operations.\n\nAppendix\n\nList of Topics Discussed in the Preliminary Decision Memorandum\n\nI.

For each of the subsidy programs found \ncountervailable, Commerce preliminarily determines that there is a \nsubsidy, i.e., a financial contribution by an ``authority'' that gives \nrise to a benefit to the recipient, and that the subsidy is \nspecific.\\6\\ For a full description of the methodology underlying our \npreliminary determination, see the Preliminary Decision Memorandum.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ See sections 771(5)(B) and (D) of the Act regarding \nfinancial contribution; section 771(5)(E) of the Act regarding \nbenefit; and section 771(5A) of the Act regarding specificity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Commerce notes that, in making these findings, it relied on facts \navailable and, because Commerce finds that necessary information was \nmissing from the record and because respondents did not act to the best \nof their ability to respond to Commerce's requests for information, it \ndrew an adverse inference (AFA) where appropriate in selecting from \namong the facts otherwise available.\\7\\ For further information, see \nthe ``Use of Facts Available and Adverse Inferences'' section in the \nPreliminary Decision Memorandum.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See sections 776(a) and (b) of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll-Others Rate\n\n    Sections 703(d) and 705(c)(5)(A) of the Act provide that in the \npreliminary determination, Commerce shall determine an estimated all-\nothers rate for companies not individually examined. This rate shall be \nan amount equal to the weighted average of the estimated subsidy rates \nestablished for those companies individually examined, excluding any \nzero and de minimis rates and any rates based entirely under section \n776 of the Act.\n    Pursuant to section 705(c)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act, if the individual \nestimated countervailable subsidy rates established for all exporters \nand producers individually examined are zero, de minimis, or determined \nbased entirely on facts otherwise available, Commerce may use any \nreasonable method to establish the estimated subsidy rate for all other \nproducers or exporters. In this investigation, Commerce has \npreliminarily determined the estimated subsidy rate for the \nindividually examined respondents under section 776 of the Act. This is \nthe only rate available in this proceeding for deriving the all-others \nrate. Consequently, pursuant to sections 703(d) and 705(c)(5)(A)(ii) of \nthe Act, Commerce established the all-others rate by applying the \ncountervailable subsidy rate assigned to the non-responsive companies \nlisted below.\n\nPreliminary Determination\n\n    Commerce preliminarily determines that the following estimated \ncountervailable subsidy rates exist:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Subsidy rate\n                                                            (percent ad\n                         Company                             valorem)\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQingdao SISA Abrasives Co., Ltd.........................        * 165.05\nShandong Imerys Mount Tai Co., Ltd......................        * 165.05\nFutong Industry Co., Ltd................................        * 165.05\nGuangzhou Qianyang Metals & Machine.....................        * 165.05\nKumthai Abrasives Co., Ltd..............................        * 165.05\nLuoyang Runbao Super Abrasives Co.......................        * 165.05\nMore Superhard Products Co., Ltd........................        * 165.05\nQingdao Roy Grinding Material Co........................        * 165.05\nReckel Advanced Materials Co., Ltd......................        * 165.05\nZhengshou Haixu Abrasives Co............................        * 165.05\nAll Others..............................................          165.05\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Rate is based on facts available with adverse inferences.\n\nSuspension of Liquidation\n\n    In accordance with section 703(d)(2) of the Act, Commerce will \ndirect U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to suspend liquidation \nof entries of subject merchandise as described in the scope of the \ninvestigation section entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for \nconsumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the \nFederal Register. Further, pursuant to 19 CFR 703(d)(1)(B) of the Act \nand 19 CFR 351.205(d), Commerce will instruct CBP to require a cash \ndeposit equal to the rates indicated above.\n\nDisclosure\n\n    Normally, Commerce discloses to interested parties the calculations \nperformed in connection with a preliminary determination within five \ndays of its public announcement or, if there is no public announcement, \nwithin five days of the date of publication of the notice of \npreliminary determination in the Federal Register, in accordance with \n19 CFR 351.224(b). However, because Commerce preliminarily applied \ntotal AFA to the individually examined companies, Qingdao SISA \nAbrasives Co., Ltd. and Shandong Imerys Mount Tai Co., Ltd., in this \ninvestigation in accordance with section 776 of the Act, there are no \ncalculations to disclose.\n\n[[Page 21895]]\n\nVerification\n\n    Because the mandatory respondents in this investigation did not \nparticipate in this investigation and the Government of China did not \nprovide requested information, Commerce preliminarily determines each \nof these parties has been uncooperative; thus, verification will not be \nconducted.\n\nPublic Comment\n\n    All interested parties will have the opportunity to submit scope \ncase and rebuttal briefs on the preliminary decision regarding the \nscope of the LTFV and CVD investigations. The deadlines to submit scope \ncase and rebuttal briefs will be provided in the preliminary scope \ndecision memorandum accompanying the preliminary determination of the \nLTFV investigation. For all scope case and rebuttal briefs, parties \nmust file identical documents simultaneously on the records of the \nongoing LTFV and CVD investigations. No new factual information or \nbusiness proprietary information may be included in either scope case \nor rebuttal briefs.\n    Case briefs or other written comments on non-scope issues may be \nsubmitted to the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Compliance no \nlater than 20 days after the date of publication of the preliminary \ndetermination.

In this investigation, we instead request \nthat interested parties provide at the beginning of their briefs a \npublic, executive summary for each issue raised in their briefs.\\10\\ \nFurther, we request that interested parties limit their executive \nsummary of each issue to no more than 450 words, not including \ncitations. We intend to use the public executive summaries as the basis \nof the comment summaries included in the issues and decision memorandum \nthat will accompany the final determination in this investigation. We \nrequest that interested parties include footnotes for relevant \ncitations in the public executive summary of each issue. Note that \nCommerce has amended certain of its requirements pertaining to the \nservice of documents in 19 CFR 351.303(f).\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ We use the term ``issue'' here to describe an argument that \nCommerce would normally address in a comment of the Issues and \nDecision Memorandum.\n    \\11\\ See APO and Service Final Rule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.310(c), interested parties who wish to \nrequest a hearing, limited to issues raised in the case and rebuttal \nbriefs, must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for \nEnforcement and Compliance, U.S. Department of Commerce within 30 days \nafter the date of publication of this notice.

If a request for a hearing is \nmade, Commerce intends to hold the hearing at a time and date to be \ndetermined. Parties should confirm by telephone the date, time, and \nlocation of the hearing two days before the scheduled date.\n\nFinal Determination\n\n    Section 705(a)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.210(b)(1) provide that \nCommerce intends to issue the final determination within 75 days after \nthe date of its preliminary determination.\n\nU.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification\n\n    In accordance with section 703(f) of the Act, Commerce will notify \nthe ITC of its determination. If the final determination is \naffirmative, the ITC will determine, before the later of 120 days after \nthe date of this preliminary determination or 45 days after the final \ndetermination, whether imports of ceramic abrasive grains from China \nare materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. \nindustry.\n\nNotification to Interested Parties\n\n    This determination is issued and published pursuant to sections \n703(f) and 777(i) of the Act, and 19 CFR 351.205(c).\n\n    Dated: May 16, 2025.\nScot Fullerton,\nActing Deputy Assistant Secretary for Antidumping and Countervailing \nDuty Operations.\n\nAppendix I\n\nScope of the Investigation\n\n    The merchandise covered by this investigation is sol gel \nalumina-based ceramic abrasive grains which are comprised of minimum \n94% aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and may contain other compounds, \nincluding, but not limited to, titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, \ncalcium oxide, sodium superoxide, ferric oxide, magnesium oxide, di-\naluminum magnesium tetroxide, lanthanum oxide, lanthanum magnesium \noxide, zirconium dioxide, or zirconium carbonate. Grain sizes of sol \ngel alumina-based ceramic abrasive grains range from 0.85 mm to \n0.0395 mm (which corresponds to American National Standards \nInstitute (ANSI) grit sizes from 20 to 280).\n    Shapes include but are not limited to angular, sharp, extra \nsharp, blocky, splintery, round stripped, triangular or shaped like \nextruded rods or stars.\n    Ceramic abrasive grains have unique crystalline structures that \nimpart certain advanced properties, such as their extreme hardness \nand strength ranging between 16 and 22 gigapascals by the Vickers \nDiamond Indent Method, high melting point (2050 [deg]C), and a \nsingle- or multi-phase microstructure, which may contain multiple \nphases, having crystalline sizes ranging from 0.05 to 30 [mu]m. \nThese ceramic abrasive grains include but are not limited to blue, \nwhite, white-translucent, or off-white opaque colors.\n    Sol gel alumina-based ceramic abrasive grains are covered by the \nscope of this investigation, whether or not incorporated into \ndownstream articles, including but not limited to, abrasive papers, \ngrinding wheels, grinding cylinders, and grinding discs.

The Issues and \nDecision Memorandum is a public document and is on file electronically \nvia Enforcement and Compliance's Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \nCentralized Electronic Service System (ACCESS). ACCESS is available to \nregistered users at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>.

The final \nresults of this administrative review shall be the basis for the \nassessment of antidumping duties on entries of merchandise covered by \nthe final results of this\n\n[[Page 21897]]\n\nreview and for future deposits of estimated duties, where \napplicable.\\8\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ In these final results, Commerce applied the assessment rate \ncalculation method adopted in Antidumping Proceedings: Calculation \nof the Weighted-Average Dumping Margin and Assessment Rate in \nCertain Antidumping Duty Proceedings; Final Modification, 77 FR 8101 \n(February 14, 2012).\n    \\8\\ See section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For entries of subject merchandise during the POR produced by \neither of the individually examined respondents for which they did not \nknow that the merchandise it sold to the intermediary (e.g., a \nreseller, trading company, or exporter) was destined for the United \nStates, we will instruct CBP to liquidate unreviewed entries at the \nall-others rate if there is no rate for the intermediate company(ies) \ninvolved in the transaction.\\9\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ For a full discussion of this practice, see Antidumping and \nCountervailing Duty Proceedings: Assessment of Antidumping Duties, \n68 FR 23954 (May 6, 2003).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Commerce intends to issue assessment instructions to CBP no earlier \nthan 35 days after the date of publication of the final results of this \nreview in the Federal Register. If a timely summons is filed at the \nU.S. Court of International Trade, the assessment instructions will \ndirect CBP not to liquidate relevant entries until the time for parties \nto file a request for a statutory injunction has expired, i.e., within \n90 days of publication.\n\nCash Deposit Requirements\n\n    Upon publication of this notice in the Federal Register, the \nfollowing cash deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments \nof the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for \nconsumption on or after the date of publication as provided by section \n751(a)(2)(C) of the Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for companies \nsubject to this review will be equal to the company-specific weighted-\naverage dumping margins established in the final results of the review; \n(2) for merchandise exported by a company not covered in this review \nbut covered in a prior completed segment of this proceeding, the cash \ndeposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published in \nthe completed segment for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter \nis not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the \ninvestigation, but the producer has been covered in a prior completed \nsegment of this proceeding, then the cash deposit rate will be the rate \nestablished in the completed segment for the most recent period for the \nproducer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all \nother producers or exporters will continue to be 1.95 percent, the all-\nothers rate established in the investigation, adjusted for the export-\nsubsidy rate in the companion countervailing duty investigation.\\10\\ \nThese cash deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect \nuntil further notice.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See Order, 86 FR at 62792.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotification to Importers\n\n    This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their \nresponsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate \nregarding the reimbursement of antidumping and/or countervailing duties \nprior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this POR. Failure \nto comply with this requirement could result in Commerce's presumption \nthat reimbursement of antidumping and/or countervailing duties occurred \nand the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.\n\nAdministrative Protective Order (APO)\n\n    This notice also serves as a final reminder to parties subject to \nan APO of their responsibility concerning the return or destruction of \nproprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR \n351.305(a)(3), which continues to govern business proprietary \ninformation in this segment of the proceeding. Timely written \nnotification of the return or destruction of APO materials or \nconversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to \ncomply with the regulations and terms of an APO is a violation subject \nto sanction.\n\nNotification to Interested Parties\n\n    Commerce is issuing and publishing this notice in accordance with \nsections 751(a)(1) and 777(i)(1) of the Act, and 19 CFR 351.221(b)(5).\n\n    Dated: May 16, 2025.\nScot Fullerton,\nActing Deputy Assistant Secretary for Antidumping and Countervailing \nDuty Operations.\n\nAppendix\n\nList of Topics Discussed in the Issues and Decision Memorandum\n\nI.

For a complete description of the \nscope of these orders, see the appendix to this notice.\n\nAD Orders\n\n    Based on the above-referenced affirmative final determinations, in \naccordance with sections 735(c)(2) and 736 of the Act, Commerce is \nissuing these AD orders. Moreover, because the ITC determined that U.S. \nimports of DOTP from Malaysia, Poland, Taiwan, and T[uuml]rkiye are \nmaterially injuring a U.S. industry, unliquidated entries of such \nmerchandise from Malaysia, Poland, Taiwan, and T[uuml]rkiye, entered or \nwithdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as described below, are \nsubject to the assessment of antidumping duties.\n    Therefore, in accordance with section 736(a)(1) of the Act, \nCommerce will direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to \nassess, upon further instruction by Commerce, antidumping duties equal \nto the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the \nexport price or constructed export price of the merchandise on all \nrelevant entries of DOTP from Malaysia, Poland, Taiwan, and \nT[uuml]rkiye. With the exception of entries occurring after expiration \nof the provisional measures period, but before publication of the ITC's \nfinal affirmative injury determination, as further described below, \nantidumping duties will be assessed on unliquidated U.S. entries of \nDOTP from Malaysia, Poland, Taiwan, and T[uuml]rkiye entered, or \nwithdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after November 5, 2024, \nthe date of publication of the Preliminary Determinations.\\3\\ Because \nCommerce made final affirmative determinations of sales at LTFV of DOTP \nfrom each of the above-referenced countries, Commerce directed CBP to \ncontinue suspension of liquidation of DOTP from Malaysia, Poland, \nTaiwan, and T[uuml]rkiye entered or withdrawn from warehouse for \nconsumption, on or after March 28, 2025, the date of publication of the \nFinal Determination.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See Dioctyl Terephthalate from Malaysia: Preliminary \nAffirmative Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, \nPostponement of Final Determination, and Extension of Provisional \nMeasures, 89 FR 87848 (November 5, 2024) (DOTP from Malaysia \nPreliminary Determination); Dioctyl Terephthalate from Poland: \nPreliminary Affirmative Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair \nValue, Postponement of Final Determination, and Extension of \nProvisional Measures, 89 FR 87844 (November 5, 2025) (DOTP from \nPoland Preliminary Determination); Dioctyl Terephthalate from \nTaiwan: Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Sales at Less Than \nFair Value, Postponement of Final Determination, and Extension of \nProvisional Measures, 89 FR 87846 (November 5, 2024) (DOTP from \nTaiwan Preliminary Determination); and Dioctyl Terephthalate From \nthe Republic of T[uuml]rkiye: Preliminary Affirmative Determination \nof Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Postponement of Final \nDetermination, and Extension of Provisional Measures, 89 FR 87855 \n(November 5, 2024) (DOTP from T[uuml]rkiye Preliminary \nDetermination) (collectively, Preliminary Determinations).\n    \\4\\ See DOTP from Malaysia Final Determination, DOTP from Poland \nFinal Determination, DOTP from Taiwan Final Determination, and DOTP \nfrom T[uuml]rkiye Final Determination.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nContinuation of Suspension of Liquidation and Cash Deposits\n\n    Except as noted in the ``Provisional Measures'' section of this \nnotice below, in accordance with section 736 of the Act, Commerce will \ninstruct CBP to continue to suspend liquidation of all relevant entries \nof DOTP from Malaysia, Poland, Taiwan, and T[uuml]rkiye. These \ninstructions suspending liquidation will remain in effect until further \nnotice.\n    Commerce will also instruct CBP to require cash deposits at a rate \nequal to the estimated weighted-average dumping margins listed in the \ntable below. Accordingly, effective on the date of publication in the \nFederal Register of the notice of the ITC's affirmative final injury \ndetermination, CBP will require, at the same time as importers would \nnormally deposit estimated duties on subject merchandise, a cash \ndeposit equal to the weighted-average dumping margins listed in the \ntable below. The all-others rate applies to all producers or exporters \nnot specifically listed, as appropriate.\n\nEstimated Weighted-Average Dumping Margins\n\n    The estimated weighted-average dumping margins, as published in \nCommerce's Final Determinations, are as follows:\n\n                                Malaysia\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Weighted-\n                                                                average\n                      Producer/exporter                         dumping\n                                                                margin\n                                                               (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPC Chemicals (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd............................        7.50\nAll Others..................................................        7.50\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                                 Poland\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Weighted-\n                                                                average\n                      Producer/exporter                         dumping\n                                                                margin\n                                                               (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGrupa Azoty Zaklady Azotowy.................................      *57.88\nAll Others..................................................       57.88\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Rate based on facts otherwise available with adverse inferences.\n\n\n                                 Taiwan\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Weighted-\n                                                                average\n                      Producer/exporter                         dumping\n                                                                margin\n                                                               (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNan Ya Plastics Corp........................................       18.73\nOxyde Chemicals Singapore Pte.

Each annual inquiry service list will be \nmaintained in ACCESS, under each case number, and under a specific \nsegment type called ``AISL-Annual Inquiry Service List.'' \\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ This segment will be combined with the ACCESS Segment \nSpecific Information (SSI) field which will display the month in \nwhich the notice of the order or suspended investigation was \npublished in the Federal Register, also known as the anniversary \nmonth. For example, for an order under case number A-000-000 that \nwas published in the Federal Register in January, the relevant \nsegment and SSI combination will appear in ACCESS as ``AISL-January \nAnniversary.'' Note that there will be only one annual inquiry \nservice list segment per case number, and the anniversary month will \nbe pre-populated in ACCESS.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested parties who wish to be added to the annual inquiry \nservice list for an order must submit an entry of appearance in the \nannual inquiry service list segment in ACCESS for the order within 30 \ndays after the date of publication of the order in the Federal \nRegister. For ease of administration, Commerce requests that a law firm \nwith more than one attorney representing an interested party in an \norder designate a lead attorney to be included on the annual inquiry \nservice list. Commerce will finalize the annual inquiry service list \nwithin five business days thereafter. As mentioned in the Procedural \nGuidance,\\13\\ the new annual inquiry service list will be in place \nuntil the following year, when the Opportunity Notice for the \nanniversary month of the order is published in the Federal Register.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See Procedural Guidance, 86 FR at 53206.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Commerce may update an annual inquiry service list at any time, as \nneeded, based on interested parties' amendments to their entries of \nappearance to remove, or otherwise modify, their list of members and \nrepresentatives, or to update contact information. Changes or \nannouncements pertaining to these procedures will be posted to the \nACCESS website at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>.\n\nSpecial Instructions for Petitioners and Foreign Governments\n\n    In the Final Rule, Commerce stated that, ``after an initial request \nand placement on the annual inquiry service list, both petitioners and \nforeign governments will automatically be placed on the annual inquiry \nservice list in the years that follow.'' \\14\\ Accordingly, as stated \nabove, the petitioners and foreign governments should submit their \ninitial entry of appearance after publication of this notice in the \nFederal Register in order to appear in the first annual inquiry service \nlist. Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.225(n)(3), the petitioners and foreign \ngovernments will not need to resubmit their entries of appearance each \nyear to continue to be included on the annual inquiry service list. \nHowever, the petitioners and foreign governments are responsible for \nmaking amendments to their entries of appearance during the annual \nupdate to the annual inquiry service list in accordance with the \nprocedures described above.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ See Final Rule, 86 FR 52335.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotification to Interested Parties\n\n    This notice constitutes the AD orders with respect to DOTP from \nMalaysia, Poland, Taiwan, and T[uuml]rkiye, pursuant to section 736(a) \nof the Act. Interested parties can find a list of AD orders currently \nin effect at <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/data-visualization/adcvd-proceedings\">https://www.trade.gov/data-visualization/adcvd-proceedings</a>.\n    These AD orders are published in accordance with section 736(a) of \nthe Act and 19 CFR 351.211(b).\n\n    Dated: May 16, 2025.\nScot Fullerton,\nActing Deputy Assistant Secretary for Antidumping and Countervailing \nDuty Operations.\n\nAppendix\n\nScope of the Orders\n\n    The merchandise covered by the orders is dioctyl terephthalate \n(DOTP), regardless of form. DOTP that has been blended with other \nproducts is included within this scope when such blends include \nconstituent parts that have not been chemically reacted with each \nother to produce a different product. For such blends, only the DOTP \ncomponent of the mixture is covered by the scope of these orders.\n    DOTP that is otherwise subject to the orders is not excluded \nwhen commingled with DOTP from sources not subject to this \ninvestigation. Commingled refers to the mixing of subject and non-\nsubject DOTP.\n\n[[Page 21900]]\n\nOnly the subject component of such commingled products is covered by \nthe scope of these orders.\n    DOTP has the general chemical formulation of \nC<INF>6</INF>H<INF>4</INF> \n(C<INF>8</INF>H<INF>17</INF>COO)<INF>2</INF> and a chemical name of \n``bis (2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate'' and has a Chemical Abstract \nService (CAS) registry number of 6422-86-2.

(ACA), both with respect to the calculation of \nconstructed value (CV) profit.\\2\\ On April 21, 2025, the American Honey \nProducers Association and the Sioux Honey Association (collectively, \nthe domestic interested parties), submitted comments in response to the \nministerial error allegations filed by ACA.\\3\\ Commerce is amending the \nFinal Results to correct these ministerial errors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See Raw Honey from Argentina: Final Results of Antidumping \nDuty Administrative Review; 2021-2023, 90 FR 15549 (April 14, 2025) \n(Final Results), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum \n(IDM).\n    \\2\\ See ACA's Letter, ``Ministerial Error Comments,'' dated \nApril 15, 2025 (ACA's Ministerial Error Allegation).\n    \\3\\ See Domestic Interested Parties' Letter, ``Petitioners' \nResponse to ACA's Ministerial Error Allegations,'' dated April 21, \n2025 (DIPs' Response to ACA's Ministerial Error Allegation).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLegal Framework\n\n    Section 751(h) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), \ndefines a ``ministerial error'' as including ``errors in addition, \nsubtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical errors resulting \nfrom inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other \nunintentional error which the administering authority considers \nministerial.'' \\4\\ With respect to final results of administrative \nreviews, 19 CFR 351.224(e) provides that Commerce ``will analyze any \ncomments received and, if appropriate, correct any . . . ministerial \nerror by amending the final results of review . . .''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See 19 CFR 351.224(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMinisterial Errors\n\n    Commerce reviewed the record, and we agree that the errors alleged \nby ACA constitute ministerial errors within the meaning of section \n751(h) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.224(f).\\5\\ Specifically, we find that \nwe made inadvertent errors related to the calculation of CV profit.\\6\\ \nPursuant to 19 CFR 351.224(e), Commerce is amending the Final Results \nto reflect the correction of the ministerial errors, as described in \nthe Ministerial Error Memorandum.\\7\\ Based on the corrections, ACA's \nfinal weighted-average dumping margin changed from 15.06 percent to \n6.19 percent. As a result, we are also revising the weighted-average \ndumping margin assigned to the non-individually examined companies, \nutilizing the same methodology used in the Final Results,\\8\\ from 4.70 \npercent to 2.61 percent. The amended weighted-average dumping margins \nare listed in the ``Amended Final Results of Review'' section below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See Memorandum, ``Analysis of Ministerial Error \nAllegations,'' dated concurrently with this Federal Register notice, \nand hereby adopted by, this notice (Ministerial Error Memorandum).\n    \\6\\ See ACA's Ministerial Error Allegation at 2-6.\n    \\7\\ See Ministerial Error Memorandum.\n    \\8\\ See Final Results, 90 FR at 15549.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For a complete discussion of the ministerial error allegation, as \nwell as Commerce's analysis, see the Ministerial Error Memorandum. The \nMinisterial Error Memorandum is on file electronically via ACCESS. \nACCESS is available to registered users at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov\">https://access.trade.gov</a>.\n\nAmended Final Results of Review\n\n    As a result of correcting these ministerial errors described above, \nCommerce determines that the following estimated weighted-average \ndumping margins exist for the period November 23, 2021, through May 31, \n2023:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ See Appendix for a list of these companies.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Weighted-\n                                                                average\n                    Producer or exporter                        dumping\n                                                                margin\n                                                               (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAsociaci[oacute]n de Cooperativas Argentinas C.L............        6.19\nReview Specific Rate for Non-Examined Companies \\9\\.........        2.61\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclosure\n\n    Commerce intends to disclose under administrative protective order \nthe calculations performed in connection with these amended final \nresults of review to interested parties within five days after public \nannouncement of the amended final results or, if there is no public \nannouncement, within five days of the date of publication of the notice \nof amended final results in the Federal Register, in accordance with 19 \nCFR 351.224(b).\n\nAssessment Rates\n\n    Pursuant to section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act and 19 CFR \n351.212(b)(1), Commerce will determine, and U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection (CBP) shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate \nentries of subject merchandise in accordance with the amended final \nresults of this review. The amended final results of this review shall \nbe the basis for the assessment of antidumping duties on entries of \nmerchandise covered by the amended final results of this review and for \nfuture deposits of estimated duties, where applicable.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For ACA, Commerce intends to calculate importer-specific AD \nassessment rates on the basis of the ratio of the total amount of \ndumping calculated for each importer's examined\n\n[[Page 21901]]\n\nsales to the total entered value of those sales. Pursuant to 19 CFR \n351.212(b)(1), ACA has not reported actual entered value for all of its \nU.S. sales; in such instances, we calculated importer-specific per-unit \nduty assessment rates by aggregating the importer's amount of dumping \ncalculated for the examined sales and dividing this amount by the total \nquantity of those sales. To consider whether the per-unit importer-\nspecific assessment rate is de minimis, we estimated the entered value \nfor each U.S. sale and calculated an estimated ad valorem importer-\nspecific assessment rate as the importer's aggregated amount of dumping \ndivided by the estimated entry value of those sales. Where either a \nrespondent's weighted-average dumping margin is zero or de minimis, or \nan importer-specific (estimated) ad valorem assessment rate is zero or \nde minimis, we intend to instruct CBP to liquidate appropriate entries \nwithout regard to antidumping duties.\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See 19 CFR 351.106(c)(2); see also Antidumping Proceeding: \nCalculation of the Weighted-Average Dumping Margin and Assessment \nRate in Certain Antidumping Proceedings; Final Modification, 77 FR \n8101, 8103 (February 14, 2012).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For entries of subject merchandise during the POR produced by an \nindividually examined respondent for which it did not know its \nmerchandise was destined for the United States, we intend to instruct \nCBP to liquidate such entries at the all-others rate (i.e., 16.92 \npercent) \\12\\ if there is no rate for the intermediate company(ies) \ninvolved in the transaction.\\13\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See Raw Honey from Argentina: Final Determination of Sales \nat Less Than Fair Value and Final Affirmative Determination of \nCritical Circumstances, 87 FR 22179, 22181 (April 14, 2022) (Final \nDetermination).\n    \\13\\ See Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings: \nAssessment of Antidumping Duties, 68 FR 23954 (May 6, 2003).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For the companies that were not selected for individual \nexamination, we will instruct CBP to assess antidumping duties at the \nassessment rate equal to the weighted-average dumping margin for the \nnon-examined companies in the amended final results of review.\n    Commerce intends to issue assessment instructions to CBP no earlier \nthan 35 days after the date of publication of the amended final results \nof this review in the Federal Register. If a timely summons is filed at \nthe U.S. Court of International Trade, the assessment instructions will \ndirect CBP not to liquidate relevant entries until the time for parties \nto file a request for statutory injunction has expired (i.e., within 90 \ndays of publication).\n\nCash Deposit Requirements\n\n    Upon publication of this notice in the Federal Register, the \nfollowing cash deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments \nof the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for \nconsumption on or after the publication date of the final results of \nthis administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(2)(C) of the \nAct: (1) the cash deposit rate for subject merchandise exported by one \nof the companies listed above will be equal to the weighted-average \ndumping margin established in the amended final results of this review, \nexcept if the rate is de minimis (i.e., less than 0.50 percent), in \nwhich case the cash deposit rate will be zero; (2) for an exporter of \nsubject merchandise previously reviewed or investigated but not covered \nby this review, the cash deposit rate will continue to be equal to the \ncompany-specific rate published for the most recently-completed segment \nof this proceeding; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this \nreview, a prior review, or the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) \ninvestigation, but the producer is, the cash deposit rate will continue \nto be equal to the rate established for the most recently-completed \nsegment of this proceeding for the producer of the merchandise; and (4) \nthe cash deposit rate for all other producers and exporters will \ncontinue to be 16.92 percent, the all-others rate established in the \nLTFV Final Determination.\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ See Final Determination, 87 FR at 22181.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    These cash deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in \neffect until further notice.\n\nNotification to Importers\n\n    This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their \nresponsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f) to file a certificate regarding \nthe reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the \nrelevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this \nrequirement could result in Commerce's presumption that reimbursement \nof antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double \nantidumping duties.\n\nAdministrative Protective Order (APO)\n\n    This notice also serves as a final reminder to parties subject to \nan APO of their responsibility concerning the return or destruction of \nproprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR \n351.305(a)(3), which continues to govern business proprietary \ninformation in this segment of the proceeding. Timely written \nnotification of the return or destruction of APO materials, or \nconversion to judicial protective order, is hereby requested. Failure \nto comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a \nsanctionable violation.\n\nNotification to Interested Parties\n\n    We are issuing and publishing these amended final results of \nadministrative review in accordance with sections 751(a)(1) and \n777(i)(1) of the Act and 19 351.221(b)(4).\n\n    Dated: May 16, 2025.\nScot Fullerton,\nActing Deputy Assistant Secretary for Antidumping and Countervailing \nDuty Operations.\n\nAppendix\n\nNon-Examined Companies Receiving a Review-Specific Weighted-Average \nDumping Margin\n\n1.

By qualitative feedback, we \nmean information that provides useful insights on perceptions and \nopinions but are not statistical surveys that yield quantitative \nresults that can be generalized to the population of study. This \nfeedback will provide insights into customer or stakeholder \nperceptions, experiences, expectations, provide an early warning of \nissues with service, or focus attention on areas where communication, \ntraining or changes in operations might improve delivery of products or \nservices. These collections will allow for ongoing, collaborative, and \nactionable communications between the Agency and its customers and \nstakeholders. It will also allow feedback to contribute directly to the \nimprovement of program management.\n    The solicitation of feedback will target areas such as: Timeliness, \nappropriateness, accuracy of information, courtesy, efficiency of \nservice delivery, and resolution of issues with service delivery. \nResponses will be assessed to plan and inform efforts to improve or \nmaintain the quality of service offered to the public. If this \ninformation is not collected, vital feedback from customers and \nstakeholders on the Agency's services will be unavailable.\n    The Agency will only submit a collection for approval under this \ngeneric clearance if it meets the following conditions:\n    <bullet> The collections are voluntary;\n    <bullet> The collections are low-burden for respondents (based on \nconsiderations of total burden hours, total number of respondents, or \nburden-hours per respondent) and are low-cost for both the respondents \nand the Federal Government;\n    <bullet> The collections are noncontroversial and do not raise \nissues of concern to other Federal agencies;\n    <bullet> Any collection is targeted to the solicitation of opinions \nfrom respondents who have experience with the program or may have \nexperience with the program in the near future;\n    <bullet> Personally identifiable information is collected only to \nthe extent necessary and is not retained;\n    <bullet> Information gathered will be used only internally for \ngeneral service improvement and program management purposes and is not \nintended for release outside of the agency;\n    <bullet> Information gathered will not be used for the purpose of \nsubstantially informing influential policy decisions; and\n    <bullet> Information gathered will yield qualitative information; \nthe collections will not be designed or expected to yield statistically \nreliable results or used as though the results are generalizable to the \npopulation of study.\n    Feedback collected under this generic clearance provides useful \ninformation, but it does not yield data that can be generalized to the \noverall population. This type of generic clearance for qualitative \ninformation will not be used for quantitative information collections \nthat are designed to yield reliably actionable results, such as \nmonitoring trends over time or documenting program performance. Such \ndata uses require more rigorous designs that address: The target \npopulation to which generalizations will be made, the sampling frame, \nthe sample design (including stratification and clustering), the \nprecision requirements or power calculations that justify the proposed \nsample size, the expected response rate, methods for assessing \npotential nonresponse bias, the protocols for data collection, and any \ntesting procedures that were or will be undertaken prior to fielding \nthe study. Depending on the degree of influence the results are likely \nto have, such collections may still be eligible for submission for \nother generic mechanisms that are designed to yield quantitative \nresults.\n    As a general matter, information collections will not result in any \nnew system of records containing privacy information and will not ask \nquestions of a sensitive nature, such as sexual behavior and attitudes, \nreligious beliefs, and other matters that are commonly considered \nprivate.\n    Affected Public: Individuals or households; Businesses or other \nfor-profits; Not-for-profit institutions; Farms; Federal Government; \nState, Local, or Tribal Governments.\n    Frequency: On occasion.\n    Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary.\n    OMB Desk Officer: Ms. Jasmeet Seehra.\n    DOD Clearance Officer: Mr. Reginald Lucas.\n\n    Dated: May 16, 2025.\nStephanie J.

Since 2012, to inform \nits public interest determination, DOE has commissioned multiple \nstudies to help assess the various facets of the public interest that \nare affected by U.S. LNG exports, including how different levels of LNG \nexports could impact the U.S. economy, environmental and climate \nconsiderations, and energy security and international considerations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 717b. The authority to regulate the imports and \nexports of natural gas, including LNG, under section 3 of the NGA \nhas been delegated to the Assistant Secretary for FECM in \nRedelegation Order No. S4-DEL-FE1-2023, issued on April 10, 2023.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On December 20, 2024, DOE published a Notice of Availability of the \n2024 LNG Export Study and Request for Comments, opening a 60-day \ncomment period.\\2\\ As stated in the notice, the purpose of the 2024 LNG \nExport Study is to provide an update to DOE's prior analyses and \nunderstanding of how varying levels of U.S. LNG exports impact and \ninform DOE's statutory public interest determination in each of the \nabove-listed non-FTA application proceedings and future non-FTA export \nproceedings.\\3\\ DOE invited comments on the Study and how it may inform \nDOE's public interest analysis. On February 5, 2025, DOE issued a \nnotice extending the comment period through March 20, 2025.\\4\\ In \ntotal, the comment period was open for a period of 90 days.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ 89 FR 104132 (Dec. 20, 2024).\n    \\3\\ 89 FR 104133.\n    \\4\\ 90 FR 9018 (Feb. 5, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    DOE received over 100,000 comments on the 2024 LNG Export Study \nfrom a variety of sources, including participants in the natural gas \nindustry, industrial users, environmental organizations, think-tanks, \nacademics, and individuals. DOE has evaluated and responded to all \nrelevant substantive issues raised in the public comments submitted in \nresponse to the Study. As previously stated, DOE does not intend to \nrevise the Study in response to the comments received. Instead, both \nthe 2024 LNG Export Study, and the comments will inform DOE's \ndetermination of the public interest in each of the above listed non-\nFTA export application proceedings and future non-FTA proceedings. \nDOE's response to comments and other Study materials are available \nelectronically on DOE/FECM's website at: <a href=\"https://fossil.energy.gov/app/docketindex/docket/index/30\">https://fossil.energy.gov/app/docketindex/docket/index/30</a>.\n\nSigning Authority\n\n    This document of the Department of Energy was signed on May 19, \n2025, by Tala Goudarzi, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of \nFossil Energy and Carbon Management, pursuant to delegated authority \nfrom the Secretary of Energy. That document with the original signature \nand date is maintained by DOE. For administrative purposes only, and in \ncompliance with requirements of the Office of the Federal Register, the \nundersigned DOE Federal Register Liaison Officer has been authorized to \nsign and submit the document in electronic format for publication, as \nan official document of the Department of Energy.

The project also includes a 213-foot-long \nretaining wall lined with sheet piling on the east riverbank downstream \nof the tailrace and a 255-foot-long retaining wall lined with sheet \npiling on the west riverbank downstream of the tailrace.\n\n[[Page 21917]]\n\n    The generators are connected to the regional electric grid by a \n4.16-kilovolt (kV) generator lead line, 525-foot-long 4.16-kV \ntransmission line, 4.16/41.6-kV step-up transformer, and 50-foot-long \ntransmission line.\n    Project recreation facilities include: (1) French Landing Park with \na hand-carry boat impoundment access site on the northern shoreline of \nthe impoundment, pavilion with picnic tables, two paved parking areas \nthat can accommodate a total of 19 vehicles, boardwalk with a fishing \nplatform, and restroom; (2) an approximately 1,150 foot-long portage \nroute that extends from an impoundment take-out site on the southern \nshoreline of the impoundment to a put-in site on the southern bank of \nthe Huron River; and (3) a tailrace fishing access site immediately \ndownstream of the powerhouse on the southern bank of the tailrace.\n    The current license requires the licensee to operate the project in \na run-of-river mode, such that outflow from the project approximates \ninflow. The minimum and maximum hydraulic capacities of the powerhouse \nare 255 and 880 cfs, respectively. The average annual generation of the \nproject was 6,919 megawatt-hours from 2011 to 2024. The current license \nalso requires environmental measures for water quality, fish, and \ncultural resources.\n    The applicants propose to modify the current project boundary as \nfollows, which would decrease the acreage enclosed by the project \nboundary from 1,327 to 1,279.9 acres: (1) revise the project boundary \naround the impoundment to follow a contour elevation of 652 feet \nNGVD29, instead of 655 feet NGVD29 under the current license, which \nwould remove a net total of 48.8 acres from the project boundary; (2) \nadd 2.4 acres of land underlying project recreation facilities; (3) add \n0.5 acre of land associated with the right embankment; and (4) remove \n1.2 acres of land associated with a non-project substation.\n    The applicants propose to: (1) continue operating the project in a \nrun-of-river mode; (2) develop an operation compliance monitoring plan, \ninvasive species management plan, and recreation management plan; (3) \ncontinue to maintain the project recreation facilities; and (4) enhance \nthe portage route trail and stairs to the put-in site.\n    l.

The Commission bases the \nindex system, found at 18 CFR 342.3, on the annual change in the \nProducer Price Index for Finished Goods (PPI-FG), plus zero-point seven \neight percent (PPI-FG + 0.78%). The Commission determined in the \nDecember 2020 Order \\1\\ and in the Order Reinstating Index \\2\\ that \nPPI-FG + 0.78% is the appropriate oil pricing index factor for \npipelines to use for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Five-Year Rev. of the Oil Pipeline Index, 173 FERC ] 61,245 \n(2020) (December 2020 Order).\n    \\2\\ Revisions to Oil Pipeline Regulations Pursuant to the Energy \nPol'y Act of 1992, 188 FERC ] 61,173 (2024) (Order Reinstating \nIndex).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The regulations provide that the Commission will publish annually \nan index figure reflecting the final change in the PPI-FG after the \nBureau of Labor Statistics publishes the final PPI-FG in May of each \ncalendar year.

The \nmodification of the system of records will be applicable on June 23, \n2025, unless FLRA OIG receives comments and determines that changes to \nthe system of records notice is necessary.\n\nADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by docket number OIG-\n2025-0001 by one of the following methods:\n    <bullet> Federal eRulemaking Portal: <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>. \nFollow the instructions for submitting comments.\n    <bullet> Email: <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c73757b715d55507c5a504e5d125b534a\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"ade2e4eae0ccc4c1edcbc1dfcc83cac2db\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n    <bullet> Fax: (202) 208-4535.\n    <bullet> Mail: Federal Labor Relations Authority, Office of \nInspector General, 1400 K Street NW, Floor 3, Washington, DC 20424.\n    <bullet> Instructions: All submissions received must include the \nagency name and docket number. All comments received will be posted \nwithout change to <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>, including any personal \ninformation provided.\n    <bullet> Docket: For access to the docket or to read background \ndocuments or comments received, go to <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Matthew Bolstad, (771) 444-5712, \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#66292f212b070f0a26000a140748010910\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"36797f717b575f5a76505a445718515940\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In this proposed modification to the system \nof records, FLRA OIG makes the following substantive changes:\n    FLRA OIG is modifying the security classification from \n``Unclassified'' to ``Sensitive but Unclassified and/or Controlled \nUnclassified Information'' to more accurately reflect the sensitive \nnature of the records. FLRA OIG is making the purpose of the system \nmore specific, from a general statement about investigative activities \nunder the Inspector General Act of 1978, to specifically describing \nthose investigative activities. FLRA OIG is revising the categories of \nindividuals covered by the system to define investigative ``subjects.'' \nFLRA OIG is also adding and defining two new categories of individuals \ncovered by the system: ``complainants'' and ``others.'' FLRA OIG is \nadding a category of records in the system to explicitly include \ncomplaints received by FLRA OIG. While this type of record was already \nincluded within the general investigative records category, a separate \ncategory for complaints will ensure the inclusion in the system is \nclear. FLRA OIG is replacing the text in the Record Source Categories \nsection with a reference to the Categories of Individuals Covered by \nthe System section and noting that the system contains investigatory \nmaterial for which sources need not be reported.\n    FLRA OIG is amending the following routine uses: a. by adding \nTribal to the list of governmental entities to which disclosure may be \nmade, and adding a violation or potential violation of a contract to \nthe basis for disclosure (1); c. by reorganizing and revising the \ncontent for clarity and adding other government-related actions for \nwhich disclosure may be made; f. by revising and reorganizing part (1) \nfor clarity and making part (2) a separate and new routine use, m.; and \ng. by substituting disclosure to a ``Member of Congress'' in place of \n``congressional office.''\n    FLRA OIG is deleting existing routine use m. for being unduly \nbroad.\n    FLRA OIG is adding the following new routine uses: m. will replace \nexisting routine use f., part (2), providing for disclosure to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice for the purpose of obtaining its advice; n. \ndisclosure to agencies and organizations in order to obtain information \nrelevant to specified FLRA OIG decisions and actions; o. disclosure to \na public authority for use in computer matching for program integrity \nand law enforcement purposes; p. disclosure to officials responsible \nfor assessing FLRA OIG operations; q. disclosure to complainants and/or \nvictims regarding progress of investigation; r. disclosure to former \nFLRA OIG employees for assistance in official matters; s. disclosure to \nthe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) for its \nresponsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act; and t. \ndisclosure to NARA for records management inspection requirements.\n    FLRA OIG is also amending the Policies and Practices for Retrieval \nof Records section to provide for retrieval by the name of complainant \nor unique control number assigned to each complaint. FLRA OIG is \nreplacing the content in the Record Access Procedures and Contesting \nRecord Procedures section with reference to the Notification Procedures \nsection. Finally, FLRA OIG is revising the Notification Procedures \nsection to identify the exemptions applicable to the system and provide \nthe FLRA OIG address for inquiries.\n    In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), FLRA OIG has provided a report \non this system of records to the Office of Management and Budget, the \nCommittee on Oversight and Accountability of the House of \nRepresentatives, and the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs of the Senate, on the proposed modified system of \nrecords.\n\n    Dated: May 19, 2025.\nDana A.

Introduction\n\n    The Commission intends to broadly examine whether the laws, \nregulations, and practices of foreign governments, or the competitive \nmethods employed by owners, operators, agents, or masters of foreign-\nflagged vessels, might violate statutes administered by the Commission, \nincluding 46 U.S.C. Chapter 421, such as by creating unfavorable \nshipping conditions in the foreign trade of the United States. The \nCommission notes that it has consistently held that its statutory \nauthorities not only protect United States flagged shipping, but that \nforeign governmental actions that are detrimental to third-flag \ncarriers can also create conditions unfavorable to shipping in the \nUnited States foreign trade within the meaning of Chapter 421. Petition \nof Ace Line, 19 S.R.R. 481, 482 (FMC 1979).\n    The Commission is now soliciting comments to assist in its \ninvestigation.\n\nII. Summary of Investigation\n\n    The Commission's statutory authority includes the mandate to \nmonitor and evaluate conditions that affect shipping in the foreign \ntrade of the United States. 46 U.S.C. 42101(a).\n    The Commission is concerned about the conditions created by the \nwide and uneven range of foreign vessel flagging laws, regulations, and \npractices. Many foreign nations take great care in creating standards \nfor vessels flagged by their registries. These standards ensure the \nefficient and reliable transit of goods throughout the ocean shipping \nsupply chain. Other foreign countries, however, have engaged in a \n``race to the bottom''--a situation where countries compete by lowering \nstandards and easing compliance requirements to gain a potential \ncompetitive edge. By offering to register and flag vessels with little \nor no oversight or regulation, countries may compete against one \nanother to gain revenue from the associated fees and to minimize the \nexpenses associated with inspecting vessels and ensuring compliance \nwith appropriate maintenance and safety requirements. In doing so, \nthese nations compete to lower the cost of registering and flagging \nvessels beyond a point where they can ensure the efficiency, \nreliability, and safety of the vessels used in the ocean shipping \nsupply chain. The use of these flags of convenience endangers the ocean \nshipping supply chain.\n    The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has issued policy \nrecommendations and adopted resolutions to address flags of convenience \nand fraudulent registries. However, the IMO's approach has not brought \nabout meaningful change nor deterrence to what is clearly a growing \nglobal problem. Moreover, if the IMO were to develop a policy solution \nto address these issues, member and cooperating countries would still \nbe required to domestically enact such regulations, leaving room for \nsome countries to choose their level of compliance. Patchwork policies \nand uneven compliance have proven ineffective in ensuring the \nreliability and efficiency of ocean shipping. Naming and shaming \ncountries suspected of flagging or operating shadow fleets or using \nflags of convenience does not prevent such practices and often leads to \nfurther concealment of illicit activities. Additionally, the lack of \nstandardized definitions for terms like flag of convenience, open \nregistry, fraudulent registry and shadow/dark fleet makes problems more \ndifficult to identify, and successfully regulate, on a global scale. \nVarying and unclear definitions of those terms lead to inconsistent \ninterpretations and result in fragmented policies that do not serve as \nan effective deterrent to vessel owners or operators who exploit lax \nrules or engage in deceptive practices. A lack of clarity and \nconsistency when different organizations classify various countries' \nregistries leads to confusing and conflicting results. As the IMO lacks \nthe authority to enforce vessel registry standards or penalize non-\ncompliant nations, its efforts are unlikely to serve as an effective \ndeterrent or bring about meaningful change to curb abuses. A \ncomprehensive and enforceable approach is needed.\n    For these reasons, the Commission is hereby initiating a \nnonadjudicatory investigation to assess vessel flagging laws, \nregulations, and practices and identify ``best practices'' that \ncontribute to responsible and safe operations of vessels as a critical \ncomponent of a reliable and efficient ocean shipping system in the U.S. \nforeign trade. As part of the investigation, the Commission will also \nassess and identify practices that allow or contribute to unsafe \nconditions which endanger and imperil the reliability and efficiency of \nocean shipping.\n    At this initial stage of the investigation, the Commission's \nefforts are concentrated on encouraging comments on worldwide vessel \nflagging practices from all interested stakeholders.\n\nIII. Global Flagging Practices\n\nA. Responsible Flagging Practices\n\n    Ships flying the flags of countries engaged in responsible flagging \npractices operate under strict regulatory compliance and follow robust \nmaritime laws drafted consistent with\n\n[[Page 21927]]\n\ninternational standards like the IMO's Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), \nthe International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships \n(MARPOL), and Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for \nSeafarers (STCW), among others, which provide for regular inspections \nand certifications. Operators of these vessels incur higher operational \ncosts in complying with stricter regulations, higher wages for crews, \nand more comprehensive, regular maintenance and safety measures. They \nalso comply with more stringent safety protocols and environmental \nregulations, offering better protection for the crew and the \nenvironment. Ownership and management are often transparent, tied to \nthe country of registration, with clear accountability and oversight \nunder national laws. Crews benefit from better labor standards, \nincluding fair wages and safer working conditions, mandated by the \nflagging country's labor laws. These restrictions and protections are \ntypically much more robust than those of countries offering flags of \nconvenience. Vessels flagged under responsible laws are far more likely \nto adhere to international maritime conventions adopted to ensure \nvessel safety, protect the crew, and reduce pollution. Because they \nfollow sound practices, vessels operated under these flags are much \nmore likely to be perceived as reliable and trustworthy due to their \ncommitment to higher operational, safety, and ethical standards.\n\nB. Unfavorable Flagging Practices\n\n    Ships registered under so called flags of convenience (FOC) operate \nunder lax regulatory oversight, leading to lower safety, environmental, \nand labor standards. These ship owners may pay substandard wages that \nattract inexperienced crews who lack specialized training in operating \nthe vessel or following strict safety protocols. Since FOC ships have \nno real commitment to the flagging country, or in some cases to any \ncountry, they are beyond the reach of any single national seafarers' \ntrade union. This results in poor working conditions, less experienced \nmariners, and fewer labor protections for multinational crews, which \ncontribute to unsafe conditions onboard a vessel. Additionally, FOC \nvessels exploit lower operational costs through reduced taxes, cheaper \nlabor, and irregular maintenance or safety measures. Many FOC vessels \nalso fail to fully comply with international maritime conventions like \nSTCW, SOLAS, or MARPOL, and may avoid regular inspections or \ncertifications. In some instances, vessels deactivate their Automatic \nIdentification Systems (AIS) to hide their location or use fraudulent \nIMO numbers to disguise illicit activities.\\1\\ A report by a leading \nmaritime artificial intelligence company, Windward, indicates a major \nchange in how vessels experiencing GPS jamming appear on tracking maps. \nThe average distance vessels jump when their AIS is jammed grew from \n600km in Q4 2024 to 6,300km in Q1 2025. The report concluded, ``This \ndistance completely disrupts trade and safety measures at sea, making \nit nearly impossible to track vessels within any realistic or relevant \ngeographical vicinity''.\\2\\ \\3\\ Disabling a ship's AIS massively \nincreases the chance of colliding with another vessel on the open sea. \nThe ownership and management flexibility provided by FOC registries \nallow shipowners to avoid national regulations, including stricter \nsafety, working conditions, and tax laws. This lack of accountability \nposes significant reputational risks for FOC vessels, which are often \nassociated with poor environmental records, substandard safety \npractices, and worker exploitation. Furthermore, flag-hopping or the \nuse of false flags exacerbates these issues by undermining regulatory \noversight,\\4\\ enabling the circumvention of laws, and creating \ninconsistencies in enforcing environmental standards, ultimately \njeopardizing both crew welfare and maritime safety.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Lloyd's List describes a vessel spoofing AIS location data \nto enable delivery of sanctioned oil and ship-to -ship transfers off \nthe coast of Singapore.

In 2019, the \nIMO Assembly urged governments to send the names of their ship \nregistration authorities and field offices, along with contact details, \nto the IMO Secretary-General to update the Global Integrated Shipping \nInformation System (GISIS) \\5\\ module. France and the Netherlands \nreported that as of January 15, 2025, only 62 member states responded \nwith this information.\\6\\ Based on this lack of responsiveness, France \nadvocated for ``an effective, concerted, and global approach.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ GISIS is an online system created by the IMO to share and \nmanage important maritime information globally. It collects and \nprovides key shipping information, such as ship details, ownership, \nand safety data, helping countries, companies, and organizations \nstay updated on regulations and track important maritime \ninformation.\n    \\6\\ Declan Bush, IMO Wonders How to Start Its Fight Against \nFlagging Fraud, International Maritime Organization (Mar. 25, 2025), \n<a href=\"https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1152982/IMO-wonders-how-to-start-itsfight-against-flagging-fraud/\">https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1152982/IMO-wonders-how-to-start-itsfight-against-flagging-fraud/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The ``shadow fleet'' refers to a group of ships that operate \noutside the regular or official frameworks of the global maritime \nindustry, often engaging in illegal or illicit activities such as \nsmuggling, sanction evasion, or transporting prohibited goods, \nsometimes without proper documentation to avoid international \nscrutiny.\\2\\ Shadow fleets are a direct response to international or \nunilateral economic sanctions. The ownership and operational details of \nshadow fleet ships are often concealed or disguised, using false \ndocumentation or shell companies to obscure the true identity of the \nowner.\\7\\ These vessels operate in secrecy, occasionally turning off \ntheir AIS or using fraudulent IMO numbers to avoid detection. Shadow \nfleet ships may also be unregistered, operating in international waters \nwhere oversight is minimal, which complicates enforcement efforts and \nregulatory compliance. By exploiting regulatory loopholes, they avoid \ntaxes, bypass labor and environmental laws, and engage in unregulated \nshipping practices. In some cases, shadow fleets have been linked to \norganized crime and serious egregious offenses like human trafficking \nand arms smuggling. Shadow fleet vessels may tend to operate outside \nthe constraints of international law to facilitate activities like \nillegal fishing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ Russia's 'Shadow Fleet': Bringing the Threat to Light, \nEuropean Parliament (Nov. 2024), <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2024/766242/EPRS_BRI\">https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2024/766242/EPRS_BRI</a>(2024)766242_EN.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC. Risks to U.S. Foreign Commerce\n\n    The Commission's purposes include ensuring an efficient and \neconomical ocean commerce transportation system and promoting the \nexport of United States goods through a competitive and efficient \nsystem. This global race to the bottom could dramatically undermine the \nefficiency and reliability of the\n\n[[Page 21928]]\n\ninternational ocean shipping supply chain.\n    Recent domestic incidents linked to flags of convenience highlight \nthe urgent need to address these issues. A March 2025 National \nTransportation Safety Board report \\8\\ underscores how flags of \nconvenience have been associated with serious safety risks, such as \nbridge collapses and near-misses. One example is the MV Dali, which \nlost power and caused the March 2024 collapse of the Francis Scott Key \nBridge in Baltimore, Maryland. This vessel was registered in the \nMarshall Islands \\9\\ and flagged in Singapore, with the Marshall \nIslands flag being one of the most commonly used flags of convenience. \nLess than two weeks later, another large containership, the APL \nQingdao, lost power and narrowly avoided colliding with New York City's \nVerrazzano Bridge.\\10\\ The vessel had been flagged in Malta since \n2021,\\11\\ considered a flag of convenience by some organizations. The \ncrash of the MV Dali into the Francis Scott Key Bridge highlights not \nonly the fragility of domestic and international supply chains, but \nalso the dangers posed to critical infrastructure by international \nocean shipping vessels operating under flags of convenience. One \nmalfunctioning vessel can incapacitate a port for weeks, or longer, and \nforce the rerouting of global streams of commerce, a risk that \nincreases exponentially when flagging nations eschew oversight and \nowners and operators ignore best practices. Responsible ship owners and \noperators that use registries and flags of responsible foreign nations \nbear these negative externalities through elevated costs created by \nirresponsible foreign nations and parties that cut all costs associated \nwith flagging to an unacceptable minimum.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ Safeguarding Bridges from Vessel Strikes: Need for \nVulnerability Assessment and Risk Reduction Strategies, National \nTransportation Safety Board (Mar. 18, 2025), MIR-25-10 <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/MIR2510.pdf\">https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/MIR2510.pdf</a>.\n    \\9\\ Dali, Equasis, Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development \nand Energy (Mar. 27, 2024), <a href=\"https://www.equasis.org/EquasisWeb/restricted/ShipInfo?fs=Search&P_IMO=9697426\">https://www.equasis.org/EquasisWeb/restricted/ShipInfo?fs=Search&P_IMO=9697426</a>.\n    \\10\\ Another Box ship Loses Propulsion Near an Iconic East Coast \nBridge, The Maritime Executive (Apr. 8, 2024), <a href=\"https://maritime-executive.com/article/another-container-ship-loses-propulsion-on-approach-to-an-e-coast-bridge\">https://maritime-executive.com/article/another-container-ship-loses-propulsion-on-approach-to-an-e-coast-bridge</a>.\n    \\11\\ APL Qingdao, VesselFinder (Apr. 9, 2025), <a href=\"https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/\">https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Other recent events emphasize the severity of risks created when \nvessels operate under flags of convenience or without a flag. On March \n23, 2025, the Taiwanese Coast Guard detained a Chinese ship for \noperating without registration,\\12\\ and in February 2025, a Djibouti \nflagged oil tanker, MS Melenia, and crew were left stranded without \nfuel after the tanker vessel was abandoned for a third time in two \nyears, disowned by its flag state, and sanctioned by the U.S.\\13\\ \nFurther, vessels tied to the shadow fleet have recently suffered \nexplosions at sea and at berth. A vessel carrying tons of fuel and \nlacking adequate maintenance or safety oversight has the potential to \ndevastate an entire port. These kinds of incidents very likely create \nconditions unfavorable to shipping in the foreign trade.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ Taiwan Detains Chinese Fuel Barge Operating Without \nRegistration, The Maritime Executive (Mar. 24, 2025), <a href=\"https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/video-taiwan-detains-chinese-fuel-barge-operating-without-registration\">https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/video-taiwan-detains-chinese-fuel-barge-operating-without-registration</a>.\n    \\13\\ Paul Peachey, VLCC Crew Left Adrift Without Fuel After \nSanctioned Tanker Abandoned for Third Time in Two Years, TradeWinds \n(Mar. 24, 2025), <a href=\"https://www.tradewindsnews.com/regulation/vlcc-crew-leftadrift-without-fuel-after-sanctioned-tanker-abandoned-for-third-time-in-two-years/2-1-1796938\">https://www.tradewindsnews.com/regulation/vlcc-crew-leftadrift-without-fuel-after-sanctioned-tanker-abandoned-for-third-time-in-two-years/2-1-1796938</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV. Investigation and Initial Request for Comments\n\n    The Commission has determined that the above situation bears \nfurther scrutiny. The Commission therefore orders and initiates a \nnonadjudicatory investigation under 46 CFR part 502, subpart R \n(Sec. Sec.  502.281-502.291). The Commission designates the General \nCounsel to lead the investigation, under 46 U.S.C. 46104 and 46 CFR \n502.284.\\14\\ The Commission also orders that all comments shall be \npublic under 46 CFR 502.291, unless confidential treatment is \nspecifically requested for good cause.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ Under the authority of 46 U.S.C. 46104, the Commission \ndelegates to the General Counsel: (1) authority under 46 CFR \n502.286, 502.287 and 502.288 to compel the production of information \nand witnesses or evidence; (2) authority under 46 CFR 502.291 to \nwithhold from public disclosure a response to this investigation, \nand (3) authority under 46 CFR 502.289 to take appropriate action \nagainst parties for failure to comply with the investigational \nprocess.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As part of the investigation, the Commission is asking interested \npersons to submit written comments containing evidence, experiences, \nand/or data relevant to the wide range of flagging practices across \nforeign nations. In particular, the Commission seeks:\n    1. Specific examples of responsible flagging laws, regulations, \npractices, and proposals, including how they contribute or would \ncontribute to the efficiency and reliability of the ocean shipping \nsupply chain.\n    2. Specific examples of unfavorable flagging laws, regulations, and \npractices that endanger the efficiency and reliability of the ocean \nshipping supply chain, including:\n    a. how irresponsible vessel flagging laws, regulations, and \npractices endanger the efficiency and reliability of the ocean shipping \nsupply chain;\n    b. which irresponsible laws, regulations, and practices pose the \ngreatest danger;\n    c. whether irresponsible vessel flagging laws, regulations, and \npractices foster the development of malign actors or fleets, such as \nthe so-called shadow fleet; and\n    d. how irresponsible vessel flagging laws, regulations, and \npractices endanger maritime infrastructure, such as ports, bridges, \ncanals, and chokepoints;\n    3. Practices by owners or operators of vessels that undermine the \nefficiency and reliability of international ocean shipping, including:\n    a. dangers posed by under-insured or uninsured vessels, including \nto other vessels, maritime infrastructure, and mariners;\n    b. dangers posed by vessels with poor or non-existent maintenance \nprograms and few or no safety measures;\n    c. dangers posed by inexperienced vessel owners, operators, or \nagents;\n    d. dangers posed by inexperienced or unqualified mariners; and\n    e. dangers posed to freedom-of-navigation principles by \nirresponsible vessels owners and operators, such as dragging anchors \ndamaging undersea cables/infrastructure, or through turning off, \njamming, or spoofing \\15\\ AIS/GPS.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ Jamming involves broadcasting a strong signal to interfere \nwith the reception of legitimate navigation signals, effectively \nblocking them. Spoofing, on the other hand, involves sending false \nnavigation signals to trick the receiver into believing it is in a \ndifferent location.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    4. The benefits to international ocean shipping of responsible \nvessel registration and flagging practices, including:\n    a. potential benefits to ocean shipping efficiency and reliability \nof standards for flagging laws, regulations, and practices;\n    b. the most important responsible flagging laws, regulations, and \npractices that contribute to the efficiency and reliability of ocean \nshipping;\n    c. how Commission regulations could support responsible flagging \nlaws, regulations, and practices; and\n    d. how Commission regulations could deter irresponsible flagging \nlaws, regulations, and practices.\n    5. The burdens to foreign nations and vessel operators or owners of \nirresponsible flagging practices.\n    The Commission's jurisdiction is broad, and the agency welcomes \ncomments from all members of the public, including shippers, carriers,\n\n[[Page 21929]]\n\ngovernments, and nongovernmental organizations. The Commission is \nparticularly interested in input from international standards setting \norganizations, such as the IMO and International Transport Workers' \nFederation, countries with large ship registries, and those with \nevidence of the burdens and risks created by irresponsible flagging \npractices.\n    As the Commission proceeds with this investigation, the General \nCounsel or the Commission may decide to request additional comments or \ngather information through other means as authorized under 46 U.S.C. \n40104, 42104, 42109, and 46 CFR part 550.\n\n    By the Commission.\nDavid Eng,\nSecretary.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09236 Filed 5-21-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6730-02-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

They should not be construed to mean that the \ncommunity must change any existing ordinances that are more stringent \nin their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any \ntime enact stricter requirements of its own or pursuant to policies \nestablished by other Federal, State, or regional entities. These flood \nhazard determinations are used to meet the floodplain management \nrequirements of the NFIP.\n    The communities affected by the flood hazard determinations are \nprovided in the tables below. Any request for reconsideration of the \nrevised flood hazard information shown on the Preliminary FIRM and FIS \nreport that satisfies the data requirements outlined in 44 CFR 67.6(b) \nis considered an appeal. Comments unrelated to the flood hazard \ndeterminations also will be considered before the FIRM and FIS report \nbecome effective.\n    Use of a Scientific Resolution Panel (SRP) is available to \ncommunities in support of the appeal resolution process. SRPs are \nindependent panels of experts in hydrology, hydraulics, and other \npertinent sciences established to review conflicting scientific and \ntechnical data and provide recommendations for resolution. Use of the \nSRP only may be exercised after FEMA and local communities have been \nengaged in a collaborative consultation process for at least 60 days \nwithout a mutually acceptable resolution of an appeal. Additional \ninformation regarding the SRP process can be found online at <a href=\"https://www.floodsrp.org/pdfs/srp_overview.pdf\">https://www.floodsrp.org/pdfs/srp_overview.pdf</a>.\n    The watersheds and/or communities affected are listed in the tables \nbelow. The Preliminary FIRM, and where applicable, FIS report for each \ncommunity are available for inspection at both the online location \n<a href=\"https://hazards.fema.gov/femaportal/prelimdownload\">https://hazards.fema.gov/femaportal/prelimdownload</a> and the respective \nCommunity Map Repository address listed in the tables. For communities \nwith multiple ongoing Preliminary studies, the studies can be \nidentified by the unique project number and Preliminary FIRM date \nlisted in the tables. Additionally, the current effective FIRM and FIS \nreport for each community are accessible online through the FEMA Map \nService Center at <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov\">https://msc.fema.gov</a> for comparison.\n\n(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance No. 97.022, ``Flood \nInsurance.'')\n\nKristin E.

They should not be construed to mean that the \ncommunity must change any existing ordinances that are more stringent \nin their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any \ntime enact stricter requirements of its own or pursuant to policies \nestablished by other Federal, State, or regional entities. These flood \nhazard determinations are used to meet the floodplain management \nrequirements of the NFIP.\n    The communities affected by the flood hazard determinations are \nprovided in the tables below. Any request for reconsideration of the \nrevised flood hazard information shown on the Preliminary FIRM and FIS \nreport that satisfies the data requirements outlined in 44 CFR 67.6(b) \nis considered an appeal. Comments unrelated to the flood hazard \ndeterminations also will be considered before the FIRM and FIS report \nbecome effective.\n    Use of a Scientific Resolution Panel (SRP) is available to \ncommunities in support of the appeal resolution process. SRPs are \nindependent panels of experts in hydrology, hydraulics, and other \npertinent sciences established to review conflicting scientific and \ntechnical data and provide recommendations for resolution. Use of the \nSRP only may be exercised after FEMA and local communities have been \nengaged in a collaborative consultation process for at least 60 days \nwithout a mutually acceptable resolution of an appeal. Additional \ninformation regarding the SRP process can be found online at <a href=\"https://www.floodsrp.org/pdfs/srp_overview.pdf\">https://www.floodsrp.org/pdfs/srp_overview.pdf</a>.\n    The watersheds and/or communities affected are listed in the tables \nbelow.

For communities \nwith multiple ongoing Preliminary studies, the studies can be \nidentified by the unique project number and Preliminary FIRM date \nlisted in the tables.

The mine operator is required by Sec.  \n77.1000-1 to file the ground control plan under Sec.  77.1000 for \nhighwalls, pits and spoil banks with the appropriate District Manager. \nThe mining methods employed by the operator are selected to ensure \nhighwall, pit, and spoil bank stability. In the event of a highwall \nfailure or material dislodgment, there may be very little time to \nescape possible injury; therefore, preventive measures must be taken. \nEach plan is based on the type of strata expected to be encountered, \nthe height and angle of highwalls and spoil banks, and the equipment to \nbe used at the mine. The plan is used to show how the mine operator \nwill maintain safe conditions around the highwalls, pits, and spoil \nbanks. Each plan is reviewed by MSHA to ensure that highwalls, pits, \nand spoil banks are maintained in a safe condition\n\n[[Page 21952]]\n\nthrough the use of sound engineering design.

Discussion\n\n    By letter dated April 1, 2025, Duke Energy Progress, LLC (Duke) \nsubmitted to the NRC an application for subsequent license renewal \n(SLR) of RNP Renewed Facility Operating License No. DPR-32 for an \nadditional 20 years of operation. This submission initiated the NRC's \nproposed action of determining whether to grant the SLR application. \nRNP is located in Darlington County, approximately 5 miles west-\nnorthwest of Hartsville, in northeastern South Carolina. The current \nRNP license expires at midnight on July 31, 2030. The SLR application \nwas submitted pursuant to part 54, of title 10 of the Code of Federal \nRegulations (10 CFR), ``Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses \nfor Nuclear Power Plants,'' and seeks to extend the license for RNP to \nmidnight on July 31, 2050. A notice of receipt and availability of the \napplication was published in the Federal Register on April 21, 2025 (90 \nFR 16707). A notice of acceptance for docketing of the application and \nof an opportunity to request a hearing was published in the Federal \nRegister on May 8, 2025 (90 FR 19535) and is available on the Federal \nrulemaking website (<a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>) by searching for \nDocket ID NRC-2025-0076.\n\nIII. Request for Comment\n\n    This notice informs the public of the NRC's intention to conduct \nenvironmental scoping and prepare a SEIS related to the SLR application \nfor RNP and provides the public an opportunity to participate in the \nenvironmental scoping process, as defined in 10 CFR 51.29, ``Scoping-\nenvironmental impact statement and supplement to environmental impact \nstatement,'' and 10 CFR 51.116, ``Notice of intent.''\n    The regulations in 36 CFR 800.8, ``Coordination with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act,'' allow agencies to use their National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) \n(NEPA), process to fulfill the requirements of Section 106 of the \nNational Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (54 U.S.C. \n300101, et seq.) (NHPA). Therefore, pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8(c), the \nNRC intends to use its process and documentation required for the \npreparation of the SEIS on the proposed action to comply with Section \n106 of the NHPA in lieu of the procedures set forth at 36 CFR 800.3 \nthrough 800.6.\n    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.53(c) and 10 CFR 54.23, Duke submitted \nan ER as part of the SLR application. The ER was prepared pursuant to \n10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic \nLicensing and Related Regulatory Functions,'' and is publicly available \nin ADAMS under Accession No. ML25091A296. The ER will also be available \nfor viewing at <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications/robinson-subsequent.html\">https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications/robinson-subsequent.html</a>.\n    The NRC intends to gather the information necessary to prepare the \nSEIS as a plant-specific supplement to NUREG-1437, ``Generic \nEnvironmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants'' \n(ADAMS Package Accession No. ML24087A133). The SEIS will evaluate the \nenvironmental impacts of SLR for RNP, and reasonable alternatives \nthereto. Possible alternatives to the proposed action include the no-\naction alternative and reasonable alternative energy sources. This \nnotice is being published in accordance with NEPA and the NRC's \nregulations at 10 CFR part 51.\n    As part of its environmental review, the NRC will first conduct a \nscoping process for the SEIS and, as soon as practicable thereafter, \nwill prepare a draft SEIS for public comment. Participation in this \nscoping process by members of the public and local, State, Tribal, and \nFederal government agencies is encouraged. The scoping process for the \nSEIS will be used to accomplish the following:\n    a. Define the proposed action that is to be the subject of the \nSEIS;\n    b. Determine the scope of the SEIS and identify the significant \nissues to be analyzed in depth;\n    c. Identify and eliminate from detailed study those issues that are \nperipheral or are not significant or that have been covered by prior \nenvironmental review;\n    d. Identify any environmental assessments and other environmental \nimpact statements that are being or will be prepared that are related \nto, but are not part of, the scope of the SEIS under consideration;\n    e. Identify other environmental review and consultation \nrequirements related to the proposed action;\n    f. Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation \nof the environmental analyses and the NRC's tentative planning and \ndecision-making schedule;\n    g. Identify any cooperating agencies and, as appropriate, allocate \nassignments for preparation and schedules for completing the SEIS to \nthe NRC and any cooperating agencies; and\n    h. Describe how the SEIS will be prepared, including any contractor \nassistance to be used.\n    The NRC invites the following entities to participate in scoping:\n    a. The applicant, Duke;\n    b. Any Federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special \nexpertise with respect to any environmental impact involved or that is \nauthorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;\n    c. Affected State and local government agencies, including those \nauthorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;\n    d. Any affected Indian Tribe;\n    e. Any person who requests or has requested an opportunity to \nparticipate in the scoping process; and\n    f. Any person who has petitioned or intends to petition for leave \nto intervene under 10 CFR 2.309.\n    Participation in the scoping process for the RNP SLR SEIS does not \nentitle participants to become parties to the proceeding to which the \nSEIS relates.\n\n    Dated: May 19, 2025.\n\n    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\nJohn Moses,\nDeputy Director, Division of Rulemaking, Environmental, and Financial \nSupport, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09237 Filed 5-21-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 7590-01-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

(``BZX'' or ``Exchange'') filed \nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the \nproposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which \nItems have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing \nthis notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from \ninterested persons.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to update its Fee Schedule to provide a \ntemporary 20% discount on fees assessed to Exchange Members and non-\nMembers that purchase $20,000 or more of ad hoc purchases of historical \nOpen-Close Data, effective April 23, 2025 through June 30, 2025. The \ntext of the proposed rule change is provided in Exhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/BZX/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/BZX/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at \nthe Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\n[[Page 21956]]\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to update its Fee Schedule to provide a \ntemporary 20% discount on fees assessed to Exchange Members \\3\\ and \nnon-Members for any single purchase of End-of-Day Ad-hoc Request \n(historical data) and/or Intraday Ad-hoc Request (historical data) that \nmeets the minimum purchase requirement of at least $20,000 of \nhistorical Open-Close Data, effective April 23, 2025 through June 30, \n2025.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See Rule 1.5(n) (``Member''). The term ``Member'' shall mean \nany registered broker or dealer that has been admitted to membership \nin the Exchange. A Member will have the status of a ``member'' of \nthe Exchange as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(3) of the Act. \nMembership may be granted to a sole proprietor, partnership, \ncorporation, limited liability company or other organization which \nis a registered broker or dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Act, \nand which has been approved by the Exchange.\n    \\4\\ The Exchange initially submitted the proposed rule change on \nApril 23, 2025 (SR-CboeBZX-2025-061). On May 6, 2025, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, the Exchange currently offers End-of-Day \n(``EOD'') and Intraday Open-Close Data (collectively, ``Open-Close \nData''). EOD Open-Close Data is an end-of-day volume summary of trading \nactivity on the Exchange at the option level by origin (customer, \nprofessional customer, broker-dealer, and market maker), side of the \nmarket (buy or sell), price, and transaction type (opening or closing). \nThe customer and professional customer volume is further broken down \ninto trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 contracts, \ngreater than 199 contracts). The EOD Open-Close Data is proprietary \nExchange trade data and does not include trade data from any other \nexchange. It is also a historical data product and not a real-time data \nfeed. The Exchange also offers Intraday Open-Close Data, which provides \nsimilar information to that of EOD Open-Close Data but is produced and \nupdated every 10 minutes during the trading day. Data is captured in \n``snapshots'' taken every 10 minutes throughout the trading day and is \navailable to subscribers within five minutes of the conclusion of each \n10-minute period.\\5\\ The Intraday Open-Close Data provides a volume \nsummary of trading activity on the Exchange at the option level by \norigin (customer, professional customer, broker-dealer, and market \nmaker), side of the market (buy or sell), and transaction type (opening \nor closing). The customer and professional customer volume are further \nbroken down into trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 \ncontracts, greater than 199 contracts). The Intraday Open-Close Data is \nproprietary Exchange trade data and does not include trade data from \nany other exchange. All Open-Close Data products are completely \nvoluntary products, in that the Exchange is not required by any rule or \nregulation to make this data available and that potential customers may \npurchase it on an ad-hoc basis only if they voluntarily choose to do \nso.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ For example, subscribers to the intraday product will \nreceive the first calculation of intraday data by approximately 9:42 \na.m. ET, which represents data captured from 9:30 a.m. to 9:40 a.m. \nSubscribers will receive the next update at 9:52 a.m., representing \nthe data previously provided together with data captured from 9:40 \na.m. through 9:50 a.m., and so forth. Each update will represent the \naggregate data captured from the current ``snapshot'' and all \nprevious ``snapshots.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe LiveVol, LLC (``LiveVol''), a wholly owned subsidiary of the \nExchange's parent company, Cboe Global Markets, Inc., makes the Open-\nClose Data available for purchase to Members and non-Members on the \nLiveVol DataShop website (<a href=\"http://datashop.cboe.com\">datashop.cboe.com</a>). Customers may currently \npurchase Open-Close Data on a subscription basis (monthly or annually) \nor by ad hoc request for a specified month (historical file, e.g., \nrequest for Intraday Open-Close Data for month of December 2023 or End-\nof-Day Open-Close Data for month of December 2023). An ad-hoc request \ncan be for any number of months for which the data is available.\n    Open-Close Data is subject to direct competition from similar end-\nof-day and intraday options trading summaries offered by several other \noptions exchanges.\\6\\ All of these exchanges offer essentially the same \nend-of-day and intraday options trading summary information.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ These substitute products are: Nasdaq PHLX Options Trade \nOutline, Nasdaq Options Trade Outline, ISE Profile, GEMX Trade \nProfile data; open-close data from C2, Cboe Options, and EDGX; Open \nClose Reports from MIAX Options, Pearl, and Emerald; and NYSE \nOptions Open-Close Volume Summary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to provide a temporary pricing incentive \nprogram in which Members or Non-Members that purchase historical Open-\nClose Data will receive a percentage fee discount where specific \npurchase thresholds are met. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to \nprovide a temporary 20% discount for ad-hoc purchases of historical \nOpen-Close Data of $20,000 or more.\\7\\ The proposed program will apply \nto all market participants irrespective of whether the market \nparticipant is a new or current purchaser; however, the discount cannot \nbe combined with any other discounts offered by the Exchange, including \nthe academic discount provided for Qualifying Academic Purchasers of \nhistorical Open-Close Data. The Exchange intends to introduce the \ndiscount program beginning April 23, 2025, with the program remaining \nin effect through June 30, 2025. The Exchange also notes that it \npreviously adopted the same temporary discount program and proposes to \nupdate the Fees Schedule with the new program dates accordingly.\\8\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ The discount will apply on an order-by-order basis. To \nqualify for the discount, an order must contain End-of-Day Ad-hoc \nRequests (historical data) and/or Intraday Ad-hoc Requests \n(historical data) and must total $20,000 or more; the Exchange will \nnot aggregate purchases made throughout a billing cycle for purposes \nof the incentive program. The discount will apply to the total \npurchase price, once the $20,000 minimum purchase is satisfied (for \nexample, a qualifying order of $25,000 would be discounted to \n$20,000, i.e. receive a 20% discount of $5,000).\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99027 (November 28, \n2023), 88 FR 84028 (December 1, 2023) (SR-CboeBZX-2023-094); \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 100371 (June 18, 2024), 89 FR \n53140 (June 25, 2024) (SR-CboeBZX-2024-047); and Securities Exchange \nAct Release No. 101510 (November 4, 2024), 89 FR 88838 (November 8, \n2024) (SR-CboeBZX-2024-105).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\9\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\10\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\11\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\11\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory \norganizations (``SROs'') and broker-dealers increased authority and\n\n[[Page 21957]]\n\nflexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was \nbelieved that this authority would expand the amount of data available \nto consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the \nprovision of market data. The Exchange believes the proposed fee \nchanges will further broaden the availability of U.S. option market \ndata to investors consistent with the principles of Regulation NMS. \nOpen-Close Data is designed to help investors understand underlying \nmarket trends to improve the quality of investment decisions. Indeed, \npurchasers of the data may be able to enhance their ability to analyze \noption trade and volume data and create and test trading models and \nanalytical strategies. The Exchange believes Open-Close Data provides a \nvaluable tool that purchasers can use to gain comprehensive insight \ninto the trading activity in a particular series, but also emphasizes \nsuch data is not necessary for trading and as noted above, is entirely \noptional. Moreover, several other exchanges offer a similar data \nproduct which offer same type of data content through end-of-day or \nintraday reports.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See supra note 6.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also operates in a highly competitive environment. \nIndeed, there are currently 18 registered options exchanges that trade \noptions. Based on publicly available information, no single options \nexchange has more than 17% of the market share.\\13\\ The Commission has \nrepeatedly expressed its preference for competition over regulatory \nintervention in determining prices, products, and services in the \nsecurities markets. Particularly, in Regulation NMS, the Commission \nhighlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and \nSRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the \nmarket system ``has been remarkably successful in promoting market \ncompetition in its broader forms that are most important to investors \nand listed companies.'' \\14\\ Making similar data products available to \nmarket participants fosters competition in the marketplace, and \nconstrains the ability of exchanges to charge supracompetitive fees. In \nthe event that a market participant views one exchange's data product \nas more or less attractive than the competition they can and do switch \nbetween similar products. The proposed fees are a result of the \ncompetitive environment, as the Exchange seeks to adopt fees to attract \npurchasers of historical Open-Close Data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See Cboe Global Markets U.S. Options Market Month-to-Date \nVolume Summary (April 21, 2025), available at <a href=\"https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/\">https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/</a>.\n    \\14\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting \nRelease'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed incentive program for any \nMember or non-Member who purchases historical Open-Close Data is \nreasonable because it will give purchasers the ability to use and test \nthe historical Open-Close Data at a discounted rate, prior to \npurchasing additional months or a monthly subscription, and will \ntherefore encourage and promote users to purchase the historical Open-\nClose Data. Further, the proposed discount is intended to promote \nincreased use of the Exchange's historical Open-Close Data by defraying \nsome of the costs a purchaser would ordinarily have to expend before \nusing the data product. The Exchange believes that the proposed \ndiscount is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because it will \napply equally to all Members and non-Members who purchase historical \nOpen-Close Data. Lastly, the purchase of this data product is \ndiscretionary and not compulsory. Indeed, no market participant is \nrequired to purchase the historical Open-Close Data, and the Exchange \nis not required to make the historical Open-Close Data available to all \ninvestors. Potential purchasers may request the data at any time if \nthey believe it to be valuable or may decline to purchase such data. As \nnoted above, the Exchange has previously adopted this discount program \nat other times.\\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See supra note 10.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange operates in a \nhighly competitive environment in which the Exchange must continually \nadjust its fees to remain competitive. Because competitors are free to \nmodify their own fees in response, including the adoption of similar \ndiscounts to those fees, the Exchange believes that the degree to which \nfee changes (including discounts and rebates) in this market may impose \nany burden on competition is extremely limited. As discussed above, \nOpen-Close Data is subject to direct competition from several other \noptions exchanges that offer substitutes to Open-Close Data. Moreover, \npurchase of Open-Close Data is optional. It is designed to help \ninvestors understand underlying market trends to improve the quality of \ninvestment decisions, but is not necessary to execute a trade. The \nExchange believes that this does not impose any burden on intramarket \ncompetition as the benefit is given to any purchasers who meet the \nminimum purchase amount.\n    The proposed rule changes are grounded in the Exchange's efforts to \ncompete more effectively. In this competitive environment, potential \npurchasers are free to choose which, if any, similar product to \npurchase to satisfy their need for market information. As a result, the \nExchange believes this proposed rule change permits fair competition \namong national securities exchanges. Further, the Exchange believes \nthat these changes will not cause any unnecessary or inappropriate \nburden on intermarket competition, as the proposed incentive program \napplies uniformly to any purchaser of historical Open-Close Data.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\16\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\17\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission will institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or \ndisapproved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).\n    \\17\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.

We \nresponded that an EFP would be a more appropriate mechanism to explore \nopportunities for increasing the utilization of the skate resource. In \nresponse, Red's Best has partnered with the Commercial Fisheries \nResearch Foundation, which submitted an EFP application that would \nconditionally allow vessels with skate permits to exceed skate \npossession limits for the purpose of quantifying the economic and \necological benefits and consequences of an increased skate wing trip \nlimit.\n    Based on the annual monitoring reports for fishing years 2021-2023, \nskate landings have been less than 45 percent of the total allowable \nlandings (TAL). The applicant seeks to address the underutilization of \nthe skate resource by allowing an exemption to the 4,000 lb (1.8 mt) \nper trip skate wing possession limit (9,080 lb (4.1 mt) whole weight) \nin Season 1 (May 1-August 31), and the 6,000 lb (2.7 mt) per trip \npossession limit of skate wings (13,620 lb (6.2 mt) whole weight) in \nSeason 2 (September 1-April 30).\n    Under this EFP, the trip limits would be increased to 7,000 lb (3.1 \nmt) (15,890 lb (7.2 mt) whole weight) per trip in Season 1, and 9,000 \nlb (4.1 mt) (20,430 lb (9.3 mt) whole weight) per trip in Season 2. The \nparticipating vessels would be authorized to take up to 700 trips that \nexceed the possession limit in the 2025 fishing year, with the intent \nfor each vessel to be able to make up to 100 trips. Participating \nvessels are a mix of a full-time and part-time gillnetters; the part-\ntime gillnetters would likely have all of their trips occur under this \nEFP; only a portion of trips by full-time gillnetters would be taken \nwith the increased trip limit. If any of the 7 vessels are not able to \nutilize all 100 trips, they may be utilized by the other participating \nvessels. All trips under the EFP would be exclusively wing trips \nwithout bait skate landings. This EFP could increase skate landings by \nover 2 million lb (907 mt) and, given recent skate wing ex-vessel \nprices, could have an approximate ex-vessel value of over $1.4 million. \nIn addition, given the overlap with the monkfish fishery, which at \ntimes has been constrained by skate trip limits in the Southern Fishery \nManagement Area, this EFP could improve utilization of the monkfish \nannual catch limit.\n    If approved, a condition would be placed on the EFP that, if skate \nlandings surpass 75 percent of total allowable landings in either \nSeason 1 or Season 2, the possession limit exemption would be suspended \nfor the remainder of the applicable season and vessels would be subject \nto the fishery-wide possession limit. The 2025 skate wing TAL is 10,453 \nmt. This EFP could result in an additional 2.1 million lb (952 mt) in \nwings being landed. Total previous year landings have represented \napproximately 42 percent to 50 percent of the quota, it is estimated \nthat the additional catch from this EFP would bring the total catch to \njust under 75 percent of the TAL, making the 75 percent trigger \nsufficiently precautionary. It is unlikely that all 700 trips would \nland the maximum amount of skate wings allowed, which further reduces \nthe potential for this EFP to impact other vessels.\n    All participating vessels would collect data on all large-mesh \ngillnet trips fished with and without the increased skate wing trip \nlimit. Data collection would include trip duration, number of nets set \nand soak time, quantity and value of skate catch and non-target catch, \nand fuel used. Data on monkfish catch and bycatch species would also be \ncollected. Skate wing catch and monkfish catch would be compared \nbetween trips conducted with and without the increased trip limit to \ninform project objectives.\n    If approved, the applicant may request minor modifications and \nextensions to the EFP throughout the year. EFP modifications and \nextensions may be granted without further notice if they are deemed \nessential to facilitate completion of the proposed research and have \nminimal impacts that do not change the scope or impact of the initially \napproved EFP request. Any fishing activity conducted outside the scope \nof the exempted fishing activity would be prohibited.\n    Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.\n\n    Dated: May 16, 2025.\nKelly Denit,\nDirector, Office of Sustainable Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries \nService.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09159 Filed 5-21-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 3510-22-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

The requested \npermits would allow the applicants to conduct activities intended to \npromote recovery of a species listed as endangered under the ESA. \nDocuments and other information submitted with the applications are \navailable for review, subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act of \n1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a) and the Freedom of Information Act (5 \nU.S.C. 552).\n\nBackground\n\n    With some exceptions, the ESA prohibits activities that constitute \ntake of listed species unless a Federal permit is issued that allows \nsuch activity. The ESA's definition of ``take'' includes such \nactivities as pursuing, harassing, trapping, capturing, or collecting, \nin addition to hunting, shooting, harming, wounding, or killing.\n    A recovery permit issued by us under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the ESA \nauthorizes the permittee to conduct activities with endangered or \nthreatened species for scientific purposes that promote recovery or for \nenhancement of propagation or survival of the species. Our regulations \nimplementing section 10(a)(1)(A) for these permits are found at 50 CFR \n17.22 for endangered wildlife species, 50 CFR 17.32 for threatened \nwildlife species, 50 CFR 17.62 for endangered plant species, and 50 CFR \n17.72 for threatened plant species.\n\nPermit Applications Available for Review and Comment\n\n    Proposed activities in the following permit requests are for the \nrecovery and enhancement of propagation or survival of the species in \nthe wild. The ESA requires that we invite public comment before issuing \nthe requested permits. Accordingly, we invite local, State, Tribal, and \nFederal agencies and the public to submit written data, views, or \narguments with respect to these applications. The comments and \nrecommendations that will be most useful and likely to influence agency \ndecisions are those supported by quantitative information or studies.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        Applicant, city,\n    Application No.           state            Species          Location        Take activity     Permit action\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPER18264977...........

Individuals in the United States who are \ndeaf, deafblind, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability may dial \n711 (TTY, TDD, or TeleBraille) to access telecommunications relay \nservices. Individuals outside the United States should use the relay \nservices offered within their country to make international calls to \nthe point of-contact in the United States.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \ninvite local, State and Federal agencies, Tribes, and the public to \nreview and comment on applications we have received for permits under \nsection 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended \n(ESA; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and our implementing regulations in part \n17 of title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The requested \npermits would allow the applicants to conduct activities intended to \npromote recovery of a species listed as endangered under the ESA. \nDocuments and other information submitted with the applications are \navailable for review, subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act of \n1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a) and the Freedom of Information Act (5 \nU.S.C. 552).\n\nBackground\n\n    With some exceptions, the ESA prohibits activities that constitute \ntake of listed species unless a Federal permit is issued that allows \nsuch activity. The ESA's definition of ``take'' includes such \nactivities as pursuing, harassing, trapping, capturing, or collecting, \nin addition to hunting, shooting, harming, wounding, or killing.\n    A recovery permit issued by us under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the ESA \nauthorizes the permittee to conduct activities with endangered or \nthreatened species for scientific purposes that promote recovery or for \nenhancement of propagation or survival of the species. Our regulations \nimplementing section 10(a)(1)(A) for these permits are found at 50 CFR \n17.22 for endangered wildlife species, 50 CFR 17.32 for threatened \nwildlife species, 50 CFR 17.62 for endangered plant species, and 50 CFR \n17.72 for threatened plant species.\n\nPermit Applications Available for Review and Comment\n\n    Proposed activities in the following permit requests are for the \nrecovery and enhancement of propagation or survival of the species in \nthe wild. The ESA requires that we invite public comment before issuing \nthe requested permits. Accordingly, we invite local, State, Tribal, and \nFederal agencies and the public to submit written data, views, or \narguments with respect to these applications. The comments and \nrecommendations that will be most useful and likely to influence agency \ndecisions are those supported by quantitative information or studies.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        Applicant, city,\n    Application No.           state            Species          Location        Take activity     Permit action\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPER8290815-1..........

The OSC proposed the \nrevocation of Registrant's Certification of Registration No. FH0887402, \nalleging that Registration's registration should be revoked because \nRegistrant is ``currently without authority to prescribe, administer, \ndispense, or otherwise handle controlled substances in the State of \nCalifornia, the state in which [he is] registered with DEA.'' Id. at 2 \n(citing 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3)).\n    The OSC notified Registrant of his right to file a written request \nfor hearing, and that if he had failed to file such a request, he would \nbe deemed to have waived his right to a hearing and be in default. Id. \nat 2 (citing 21 CFR 1301.43). Here, Registrant did not request a \nhearing. RFAA, at 3.\\1\\ ``A default, unless excused, shall be deemed to \nconstitute a waiver of the registrant's/applicant's right to a hearing \nand an admission of the factual allegations of the [OSC].'' 21 CFR \n1301.43(e).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Based on the Government's submissions in its RFAA dated \nDecember 10, 2024, the Agency finds that service of the OSC on \nRegistrant was sufficient. Specifically, the included Notice of \nService of Order to Show Cause indicates that on October 24, 2024, a \ncopy of the OSC was personally served on Registrant. RFAAX 1, at 1; \nsee also id. at 3 (Form DEA-12 signed by Registrant acknowledging \nreceipt of the OSC).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, ``[i]n the event that a registrant . . . is deemed to be \nin default . . . DEA may then file a request for final agency action \nwith the Administrator, along with a record to support its request. In \nsuch circumstances, the Administrator may enter a default final order \npursuant to [21 CFR] Sec.  1316.67.'' Id. Sec.  1301.43(f)(1). Here, \nthe Government has requested final agency action based on Registrant's \ndefault pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.43(c), (f), 1301.46. RFAA, at 1; see \nalso 21 CFR 1316.67.\n\nFindings of Fact\n\n    The Agency finds that, in light of Registrant's default, the \nfactual allegations in the OSC are admitted. According to the OSC, \neffective July 31, 2024, Registrant's California medical license \nexpired and was placed under a ``Delinquent'' status prohibiting \npractice. RFAAX 2, at 2. According to California online records, of \nwhich the Agency takes official notice,\\2\\ Registrant's California \nmedical license remains under the status: ``Delinquent--License Renewal \nFee Has Not Been Paid. No Practice is Permitted.'' California DCA \nLicense Search, <a href=\"https://search.dca.ca.gov\">https://search.dca.ca.gov</a> (last visited date of \nsignature of this Order). Accordingly, the Agency finds that Registrant \nis not licensed to practice medicine in California, the state in which \nhe is registered with DEA.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ Under the Administrative Procedure Act, an agency ``may take \nofficial notice of facts at any stage in a proceeding--even in the \nfinal decision.'' United States Department of Justice, Attorney \nGeneral's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 80 (1947) (Wm. \nW. Gaunt & Sons, Inc., Reprint 1979).\n    \\3\\ Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556(e), ``[w]hen an agency decision \nrests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the \nevidence in the record, a party is entitled, on timely request, to \nan opportunity to show the contrary.'' The material fact here is \nthat Registrant, as of the date of this decision, is not licensed to \npractice medicine in California. Accordingly, Registrant may dispute \nthe Agency's finding by filing a properly supported motion for \nreconsideration of findings of fact within fifteen calendar days of \nthe date of this Order. Any such motion and response shall be filed \nand served by email to the other party and to DEA Office of the \nAdministrator, Drug Enforcement Administration at \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#27434246094643434809465353485549425e546743424609404851\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"d7b3b2b6f9b6b3b3b8f9b6a3a3b8a5b9b2aea497b3b2b6f9b0b8a1\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDiscussion\n\n    Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), the Attorney General is authorized \nto suspend or revoke a registration issued under 21 U.S.C. 823 ``upon a \nfinding that the registrant . . . has had his State license or \nregistration suspended . . . [or] revoked . . . by competent State \nauthority and is no longer authorized by State law to engage in the . . \n. dispensing of controlled substances.'' With respect to a \npractitioner, DEA has also long held that the possession of authority \nto dispense controlled substances under the laws of the state in which \na practitioner engages in professional practice is a fundamental \ncondition for obtaining and maintaining a practitioner's registration. \nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 270 (2006) (``The Attorney General \ncan register a physician to dispense controlled substances `if the \napplicant is authorized to dispense . . . controlled substances under \nthe laws of the State in which he practices.' . . . The very definition \nof a `practitioner' eligible to prescribe includes physicians \n`licensed, registered, or otherwise permitted, by the United States or \nthe jurisdiction in which he practices' to dispense controlled \nsubstances. Sec.  802(21).''). The Agency has applied these principles \nconsistently. See, e.g., James L. Hooper, M.D., 76 FR 71371, 71372 \n(2011), pet. for rev. denied, 481 F. App'x 826 (4th Cir. 2012); \nFrederick Marsh Blanton, M.D., 43 FR 27616, 27617 (1978).\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ This rule derives from the text of two provisions of the \nCSA. First, Congress defined the term ``practitioner'' to mean ``a \nphysician . . . or other person licensed, registered, or otherwise \npermitted, by . . . the jurisdiction in which he practices . . . , \nto distribute, dispense, . . . [or] administer . . . a controlled \nsubstance in the course of professional practice.'' 21 U.S.C. \n802(21). Second, in setting the requirements for obtaining a \npractitioner's registration, Congress directed that ``[t]he Attorney \nGeneral shall register practitioners . . . if the applicant is \nauthorized to dispense . . . controlled substances under the laws of \nthe State in which he practices.'' 21 U.S.C. 823(g)(1). Because \nCongress has clearly mandated that a practitioner possess state \nauthority in order to be deemed a practitioner under the CSA, DEA \nhas held repeatedly that revocation of a practitioner's registration \nis the appropriate sanction whenever he is no longer authorized to \ndispense controlled substances under the laws of the state in which \nhe practices. See, e.g., James L. Hooper, M.D., 76 FR 71371-72; \nSheran Arden Yeates, M.D., 71 FR 39130, 39131 (2006); Dominick A. \nRicci, M.D., 58 FR 51104, 51105 (1993); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR \n11919, 11920 (1988); Frederick Marsh Blanton, M.D., 43 FR 27617.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    According to California statute, ``dispense'' means ``to deliver a \ncontrolled substance to an ultimate user or research subject by or \npursuant to the lawful order of a practitioner, including the \nprescribing, furnishing, packaging, labeling, or compounding necessary \nto prepare the substance for that delivery.'' Cal. Health & Safety Code \nsection 11010 (West 2024). Further, a ``practitioner'' means a person \n``licensed, registered, or otherwise permitted, to distribute, \ndispense, conduct research with respect to, or administer, a controlled \nsubstance in the course of professional practice or research in [the] \nstate.'' Id. section 11026(c).\n    Here, the undisputed evidence in the record is that Registrant \ncurrently lacks authority to practice medicine in California. As \ndiscussed above, a physician must be a licensed practitioner to \ndispense a controlled substance in California. Thus, because Registrant \ncurrently lacks authority to practice medicine in California and, \ntherefore, is not currently authorized to handle controlled substances \nin California, Registrant is not eligible to maintain a DEA \nregistration. Accordingly, the Agency will order that Registrant's DEA \nregistration be revoked.\n\nOrder\n\n    Pursuant to 28 CFR 0.100(b) and the authority vested in me by 21 \nU.S.C. 824(a), I hereby revoke DEA Certificate of Registration No. \nFH0887402, issued to Khursheed Haider, M.D. Further, pursuant to 28 CFR \n0.100(b) and the authority vested in me by 21 U.S.C. 823(g)(1), I \nhereby deny any pending\n\n[[Page 21951]]\n\napplications of Khursheed Haider, M.D., to renew or modify this \nregistration, as well as any other pending application of Khursheed \nHaider, M.D., for additional registration in California. This Order is \neffective June 23, 2025.\n\nSigning Authority\n\n    This document of the Drug Enforcement Administration was signed on \nMay 16, 2025, by Acting Administrator Robert J. Murphy.

As we recognize Asian American and \n                Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we celebrate the deep \n                and enduring impact that Asian Americans and Pacific \n                Islanders have had on our Nation. Forged by hardship \n                and trial, they have never wavered in their \n                contributions toward the advancement of our common \n                destiny.\n\n                In the 1980s, Lakshmi and Radhakrishna Chilukuri \n                immigrated from India to the United States and \n                dedicated their lives to higher education. They built a \n                life in America and raised a family, their daughters \n                Usha and Shreya, instilling in them the values of hard \n                work, perseverance, and a love of learning. Their \n                daughter, Usha, now serves as the Second Lady of the \n                United States. Tulsi Gabbard, a native of American \n                Samoa, has dedicated her career to protecting our \n                Republic, serving in the military and now as the \n                Director of National Intelligence. Today, more than \n                77,000 Asian American and Pacific Islanders heroically \n                serve our Nation in the Armed Forces. Their stories, \n                along with many others, have helped build a stronger, \n                safer, and more prosperous country.\n\n                This month, we honor the proud legacy of Asian \n                Americans and Pacific Islanders and their contributions \n                to the vast constellation of all our national triumphs. \n                They are woven into the fabric of our Republic, \n                reminding us that the American spirit is one of \n                resilience, independence, and relentless pursuit of \n                freedom and opportunity.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the \n                United States of America, by virtue of the authority \n                vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the \n                United States, do hereby proclaim May 2025 as Asian \n                American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. The \n                Congress, by Public Law 102-450, as amended, has also \n                designated the month of May each year as ``Asian/\n                Pacific American Heritage Month.'' I encourage all \n                Americans to learn more about those of Asian American, \n                Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander heritage and to \n                observe this month with appropriate programs and \n                activities.\n\n[[Page 21836]]\n\n                IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this \n                sixteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two \n                thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the \n                United States of America the two hundred and forty-\n                ninth.\n                <GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>\n                \n                    (Presidential Sig.)\n\n[FR Doc. 2025-09337\nFiled 5-21-25; 8:45 am]\nBilling code 3395-F4-P\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"

They arrived as farmers, soldiers, tailors, and \n                merchants, settling quickly and contributing greatly to \n                the fields of law, art, science, and medicine. At \n                crucial moments, Jewish Americans have joined their \n                fellow citizens in working towards America's unique \n                vision of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n                The New World allowed those Jewish people emigrating \n                from Europe to freely practice their faith without \n                persecution, for the American experiment offered \n                something providential--an escape from every indignity, \n                every abuse, and every tragedy visited upon the Jewish \n                people over their long history.\n\n                In my proclamation declaring Jewish American Heritage \n                Month in 2019, I drew from the words President George \n                Washington drafted and sent to the Hebrew Congregation \n                of Newport, Rhode Island, on August 18, 1790, \n                addressing the Jewish citizens of our new Republic. \n                President Washington's letter contained a blessing, \n                that ``the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell \n                in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will \n                of the other Inhabitants; while everyone shall sit in \n                safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall \n                be none to make him afraid.''\n\n                During my first 4 years as President, in the several \n                proclamations I issued for Jewish American Heritage \n                Month, I often had the unfortunate task of contrasting \n                President Washington's timeless blessing with whatever \n                violent acts of anti-Semitism had occurred in the \n                previous year. Each time, it was an all too painful \n                reminder of the fragility of President Washington's \n                words.\n\n                Then, October 7, 2023, happened, shattering the peace, \n                not only abroad but also at home. Since those horrific \n                attacks, the Jewish community in the United States--and \n                around the world--has faced an incredible trial, though \n                one that was not unfamiliar in Jewish history. College \n                campuses and city streets erupted into violence. Blood \n                libels were displayed proudly at protests. Those \n                wearing yarmulkes were openly assaulted in the streets. \n                The America that its Jewish citizens felt that they \n                once knew appeared to have shifted completely.\n\n                In his letter, President Washington championed a \n                different vision: ``For happily the Government of the \n                United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to \n                persecution no assistance requires only that they who \n                live under its protection should demean themselves as \n                good citizens.''\n\n                Since the day I resumed my duties as President--and \n                following President Washington's example--my \n                Administration has been determined to confront anti-\n                Semitism in all its manifestations. I say that at home \n                and abroad, on college campuses and in city streets, \n                this dangerous return of anti-Semitism--at times \n                disguised as anti-Zionism, Holocaust denialism, and \n                false equivalencies of every kind--must find no \n                quarter.\n\n                We proudly celebrate the history and culture of the \n                Jewish people in America, and we hold that President \n                Washington's words, though nearly 250 years old, still \n                carry the revolutionary promise of our Republic: that \n                every citizen\n\n[[Page 21838]]\n\n                who demeans himself as a good citizen shall sit in \n                safety under his own vine and fig tree--a covenant \n                added to a blessing.\n\n                I believe there has never been a greater friend to the \n                Jewish people than my Administration. We will never \n                deviate from our conviction that anti-Semitism has no \n                place in the greatest country in the world. As the 47th \n                President of the United States, I will use every \n                appropriate legal tool at my disposal to stop anti-\n                Semitic assaults gripping our universities. We will \n                proudly stand with our friend and ally, the State of \n                Israel. I will never waver in my commitment.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the \n                United States of America, by virtue of the authority \n                vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the \n                United States, do hereby proclaim May 2025 as Jewish \n                American Heritage Month.

Every day, throughout our \n                homeland and in far-flung regions of the world, our \n                fighting forces valiantly safeguard our liberty, defend \n                our border, and support global stability through \n                humanitarian missions and disaster relief operations. \n                In America's legacy of awe-inspiring heroes, they are \n                without equal.\n\n                As Commander in Chief, my highest responsibility is to \n                ensure our all-volunteer military, 2.1 million-strong, \n                is the world's most lethal fighting force. I have taken \n                bold steps to prioritize military excellence and \n                readiness across every branch of service, ensuring that \n                all active duty, National Guard, and Reserve members \n                who wear our Nation's uniform are prepared to deploy, \n                fight, and win against any adversary in any domain. \n                America's military will soon be stronger and more \n                powerful than ever before. Since November, enlistment \n                numbers for every branch of the Armed Forces have \n                surged--recruitment is now the highest it has been in \n                30 years.\n\n                On Armed Forces Day, we celebrate those for whom \n                patriotism is not a passive, lofty ideal, but a way of \n                life that is measured by the unyielding commitment to \n                serve this Nation with valor, vigilance, integrity, and \n                devotion to duty. It is worthy not only of a day of \n                recognition but also a lifetime of respect from a \n                grateful Nation. The First Lady joins me in saluting \n                our service members--on land, at sea, and in air and \n                space--along with their devoted families, who share in \n                this legacy of service and sacrifice.\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to increase the monthly fee for 10 Gb \nphysical ports. The text of the proposed rule change is provided in \nExhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/edga/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/edga/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at \nthe Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule relating to \nphysical connectivity fees.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange initially filed the proposed fee changes on \nJuly 3, 2023 (SR-CboeEDGA-2023-011). On September 1, 2023, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2023-015. On \nSeptember 29, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a \nSuspension of and Order Instituting Proceedings to Determine whether \nto Approve or Disapprove a Proposed Rule Change to Amend its Fees \nSchedule Related to Physical Port Fees (the ``OIP'') in anticipation \nof a possible U.S. government shutdown. On September 29, 2023, the \nExchange filed the proposed fee change (SR-CboeEDGA-2023-016). On \nOctober 13, 2023, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted \nSR-CboeEDGA-2023-017. On December 12 2023, the Exchange withdrew \nthat filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2023-022. On February 9, 2024, \nthe Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2024-\n006. On April 9, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and \nsubmitted SR-CboeEDGA-2024-013. On June 7, 2024, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2024-022. On August \n29, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-\nCboeEDGA-2024-036. On October 25, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2024-043. On December 18, 2024, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2024-051. On \nFebruary 14, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted \nSR-CboeEDGA-2025-004. On March 13, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2025-007. On May 9, 2025, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, a physical port is utilized by a Member or \nnon-Member to connect to the Exchange at the data centers where the \nExchange's servers are located. The Exchange currently assesses the \nfollowing physical connectivity fees for Members and non-Members on a \nmonthly basis: $2,500 per physical port for a 1 gigabit (``Gb'') \ncircuit and $7,500 per physical port for a 10 Gb circuit. The Exchange \nproposes to increase the monthly fee for 10 Gb physical ports from \n$7,500 to $8,500 per port. The Exchange notes the proposed fee change \nbetter enables it to continue to maintain and improve its market \ntechnology and services and also notes that the proposed fee amount, \neven as amended, continues to be in line with, or even lower than, \namounts assessed by other exchanges for similar connections.\\4\\ The \nExchange also notes\n\n[[Page 21959]]\n\nthat a single 10 Gb physical port can be used to access the Systems of \nthe following affiliate exchanges: the Cboe BYX Exchange, Inc., Cboe \nBZX Exchange, Inc. (options and equities platforms), Cboe EDGX \nExchange, Inc. (options and equities platforms), and Cboe C2 Exchange, \nInc., (``Affiliate Exchanges'').\\5\\ Notably, only one monthly fee \ncurrently (and will continue) to apply per 10 Gb physical port \nregardless of how many affiliated exchanges are accessed through that \none port.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See e.g., The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), General \n8, Connectivity to the Exchange. Nasdaq and its affiliated exchanges \ncharge a monthly fee of $16,500 for each 10Gb Ultra fiber connection \nto the respective exchange. See also New York Stock Exchange LLC, \nNYSE American LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc., NYSE Chicago Inc., NYSE \nNational, Inc. Connectivity Fee Schedule, which provides that 10 Gb \nLX LCN Circuits (which are analogous to the Exchange's 10 Gb \nphysical port) are assessed $22,000 per month, per port.\n    \\5\\ The Affiliate Exchanges are also submitting contemporaneous \nidentical rule filings.\n    \\6\\ The Exchange notes that conversely, other exchange groups \ncharge separate port fees for access to separate, but affiliated, \nexchanges. See e.g., Securities and Exchange Release No. 99822 \n(March 21, 2024), 89 FR 21337 (March 27, 2024) (SR-MIAX-2024-016).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\7\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\8\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\9\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) \\10\\ of the Act, which \nrequires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of \nreasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other \npersons using its facilities. This belief is based on various factors \nas described below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\8\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\9\\ Id.\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    First, the Exchange believes its proposal is reasonable as it \nreflects a moderate increase in physical connectivity fees for 10 Gb \nphysical ports and its offering, even as amended, continues to be more \naffordable as compared to analogous physical connectivity offerings at \ncompetitor exchanges. For example, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC \n(``Nasdaq'') and its affiliated exchanges charge a monthly fee of \n$16,500 for each 10 Gbps Ultra fiber connection and $11,000 per month \nfor each 10 Gbps fiber connection to their respective exchange.\\11\\ The \nExchange's proposed fee of $8,500 per physical port is lower than both \nof these offerings.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), General 8, \nConnectivity to the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Yet another example of higher fees charged by a competitor exchange \nis the 10 Gbps LX LCN Circuits offered by the New York Stock Exchange \nLLC and its affiliates (collectively, ``NYSE''). NYSE charges a fee of \n$22,000 per month,\\12\\ per port in contrast to the Exchange's proposed \nmonthly fee of $8,500 per month, per port. Despite the Exchange \nproposing to increase its fee for its 10 Gb physical port, it still \ncomes in at a cost significantly lower than its competitors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See New York Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE American LLC, NYSE \nArca, Inc., NYSE Chicago Inc., NYSE National, Inc. Connectivity Fee \nSchedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Lastly, the Exchange also points towards the equivalent offering \nfrom MIAX Pearl which is $8,000 per port per month for its 10 Gigabit \nULL connection.\\13\\ However, the Exchange reiterates that a single \nphysical port offered by the Exchange offers the ability to connect to \nthe Affiliated Exchanges (equities and options) and the monthly price \ndoes not change based on the number of exchanges a participant is \nconnected to. In this case, examining only the Exchange's affiliated \nequities exchanges, a participant could purchase a single physical port \nfrom the Exchange and access roughly 11% of the U.S. Equities Market, \nin contrast to purchasing a single port from MIAX Pearl and accessing \nonly around 1% of the U.S. Equities Market.\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule.\n    \\14\\ See Cboe U.S. Equities Market Volume Summary (May 5, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes the current fee does not properly \nreflect the quality of the service and product, as fees for 10 Gb \nphysical ports have been static in nominal terms since 2018, and \ntherefore falling in real terms due to inflation. As a general matter, \nthe Producer Price Index (``PPI'') is a family of indexes that measures \nthe average change over time in selling prices received by domestic \nproducers of goods and services. PPI measures price change from the \nperspective of the seller. This contrasts with other metrics, such as \nthe Consumer Price Index (CPI), that measure price change from the \npurchaser's perspective.\\15\\ About 10,000 PPIs for individual products \nand groups of products are tracked and released each month.\\16\\ PPIs \nare available for the output of nearly all industries in the goods-\nproducing sectors of the U.S. economy--mining, manufacturing, \nagriculture, fishing, and forestry--as well as natural gas, \nelectricity, and construction, among others. The PPI program covers \napproximately 69 percent of the service sector's output, as measured by \nrevenue reported in the 2017 Economic Census.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>.\n    \\16\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For purposes of this proposal, the relevant industry-specific PPI \nis the Data Processing, Hosting and Related Services (``Data PPI'') and \nmore particularly the more granular service line Data Processing, \nHosting and Related Services: Hosting, Active Server Pages (ASP), and \nOther Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure Provisioning \nServices.\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Provisioning is the process of preparing, assigning, and \nactivating IT infrastructure components, such as servers, storage, \nand network connectivity, according to user requirements. It is a \ncritical part of IT operations, as it ensures that computing \nresources are available when needed and that they are set up and \nconnected to work correctly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Data PPI was introduced in January 2002 by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics (``BLS'') as part of an ongoing effort to expand Producer \nPrice Index coverage of the services sector of the U.S. economy and is \nidentified as NAICS-518210 in the North American Industry \nClassification System (``NAICS'').\\18\\ According to the BLS ``[t]he \nprimary output of NAICS 518210 is the provision of electronic data \nprocessing services. In the broadest sense, computer services companies \nhelp their customers efficiently use technology. The processing \nservices market consists of vendors who use their own computer \nsystems--often utilizing proprietary software--to process customers' \ntransactions and data. Price movements for the NAICS 518210 index are \nbased on changes in\n\n[[Page 21960]]\n\nthe revenue received by companies that provide data processing services \nand price movements for the service line NAICS 518210 index are based \non changes in the revenue received by companies that provide, among \nother things, IT infrastructure provisioning services. Each month, \ncompanies provide net transaction prices for a specified service. The \ntransaction is an actual contract selected by probability, where the \nprice-determining characteristics are held constant while the service \nis repriced. The prices used in index calculation are the actual prices \nbilled for the selected service contract.'' \\19\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>. Among the \nindustry-specific PPIs is for North American Industry Classification \nSystem (``NAICS'') Code 518210: ``Data Processing and Related \nServices,'' NAICS index codes categorize products and services that \nare common to particular industries. According to BLS, these codes \n``provide comparability with a wide assortment of industry-based \ndata for other economic programs, including productivity, \nproduction, employment, wages, and earnings.''\n    \\19\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-services-industry-naics-518210.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-services-industry-naics-518210.htm</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The service (product) lines for which price indexes are available \nunder the Data PPI are: (1) business process management services (2) \ndata management and storage information transformation and other \nservices and (3) hosting ASP and other IT infrastructure provisioning \nservices. The most apt of these industry and product-specific \ncategorizations for purposes of this present proposal to modify fees \nfor the 10 Gb physical port fee measures inflation for the provision of \ndata processing, hosting and related services as well as other \ninformation technology infrastructure provisioning services which BLS \nidentifies as identified as NAICS-5182105.\\20\\ The Exchange believes \nthat this measure of inflation is particularly appropriate because the \nExchange's connectivity services involve hosting and providing \nconnections to its customers' telecommunications and information \ntechnology equipment, as well as preparing, assigning, and activating \nIT infrastructure components, such as servers, storage, and network \nconnectivity. The Exchange also uses its ``proprietary software,'' \ni.e., its own proprietary matching engine software, to receive orders \non the Exchange's proprietary trading platform as well as to collect, \norganize, store and report customers' transactions. In other words, the \nExchange is in the business of data processing, hosting, ASP, and \nproviding other IT infrastructure provisioning services. Specifically, \nwithin this category, the Exchange points to the financial business \nprocess management services category under the umbrella of data \nprocessing.\\21\\ The financial business process management services is \ndescribed as ``providing a bundled service package that combines \ninformation-technology-intensive services with labor (manual or \nprofessional depending on the solution), machinery, and facilities to \nsupport, host and manage a financial business process for a client, \nsuch as financial transaction processing, credit card processing, \npayment services, and lending services.'' \\22\\ The Exchange's \nconnectivity service provides connections to its customers' \ntelecommunications and information technology equipment, as well as \npreparing, assigning, and activating IT infrastructure components to \nfacilitate the transmission of orders and receipt of financial \ntransactions for its customers' while connected to the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ See <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105\">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105</a>.\n    \\21\\ See <a href=\"https://voorburggroup.org/Documents/2018%20Rome/Papers/1014.pdf\">https://voorburggroup.org/Documents/2018%20Rome/Papers/1014.pdf</a>.\n    \\22\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, the Exchange believes that this specific index is best \nsuited to guide this price increase as it reflects the change in this \nspecific instance over the last seven years instead of looking at the \nunderlying components of the service. PPI has published broad guidance \nregarding price adjustments for contracts,\\23\\ and within this it noted \nthat contracting parties should choose an index or group of indexes \nthat represent the cost for providing a particular product or service, \nrather than an index for the product itself.\\24\\ While this helps a \ncontracting seller avoid a circumstance where it is unable to raise its \nprice for the product itself if the underlying components have \nincreased and the PPI for the product itself has not yet increased--\nthis is not the case here. The Exchange instead is using historical \ndata over a seven-year period as a reference point for its proposed \nincrease moving forward--underlying components that have increased over \nthe course of seven years have since (by and large) been reflected in \nthe product itself.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting-parties.htm#FOOT5\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting-parties.htm#FOOT5</a>.\n    \\24\\ ``For example, if an apparel manufacturer were contracting \nfor long-term purchases with a producer of finished fabrics, it \nwould be more advisable to tie the price adjustment clause to a PPI \nfor synthetic fibers, processed yarns and threads, or greige fabrics \n(raw fabric), rather than to a PPI for a type of finished fabric.'' \nId.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange further believes the Data PPI is an appropriate \nmeasure for purposes of the proposed rule change on the basis that it \nis a stable metric with limited volatility, unlike other consumer-side \ninflation metrics. In fact, the Data PPI has not experienced a greater \nthan 2.16% increase for any one calendar year period since Data PPI was \nintroduced into the PPI in January 2002. For example, the average \ncalendar year change from January 2002 to December 2023 was .62%, with \na cumulative increase of 15.67% over this 21-year period. The Exchange \nbelieves the Data PPI is considerably less volatile than other \ninflation metrics such as CPI, which has had individual calendar-year \nincreases of more than 6.5%, and a cumulative increase of over 73% over \nthe same period.\\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ See <a href=\"https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/\">https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As noted above, the current 10 Gb physical port fee remained \nunchanged for almost seven years, particularly since June 2018.\\26\\ \nSince its last increase almost 7 years ago however, there has been \nnotable inflation, including under the industry- and product-specific \nPPI, which as described above is a tailored measure of inflation. \nParticularly, the Hosting, ASP and other IT Infrastructure Provisioning \nServices inflation measure had a starting value of 102.2 in June 2018 \n(the month the Exchange started assessing the current fee) and an \nending value of 118.502 in January 2025, representing a 16% \nincrease.\\27\\ This indicates that companies who are also in the hosting \nASP and other IT infrastructure provisioning services have generally \nincreased prices for a specified service covered under NAICS 5182105 by \nan average of 16% during this period.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\26\\ See Securities and Exchange Release No. 83449 (June 15, \n2018), 83 FR 28890 (June 21, 2018) (SR-CboeEDGA-2018-010).\n    \\27\\ See <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105\">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes that it is reasonable to increase its \nfees to compensate for inflation because, over time, inflation has \ndegraded the value of each dollar that the Exchange collects in fees, \nsuch that the real revenue collected today is considerably less than \nthat same revenue collected in 2018. The impact of this inflationary \neffect is also independent of any change in the Exchange's costs in \nproviding its goods and services. The Exchange therefore believes that \nit is reasonable for it to offset, in part, this erosion in the value \nof the revenues it collects. Additionally, the Exchange historically \ndoes not increase fees every year notwithstanding inflation.\\28\\ Other \nexchanges have also filed for increases in certain fees, based\n\n[[Page 21961]]\n\nin part on comparisons to inflation.\\29\\ Accordingly, based on the \nabove-described percentage change based on an industry- and product-\nspecific inflationary measure, and in conjunction with the rationale \nfurther described above and below, the Exchange believes the proposed \nfee increase is reasonable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ As the Exchange historically does not increase fees every \nyear notwithstanding inflation, the Exchange believes that the more \nspecific index is appropriate to look at as it is reflective of the \ncumulative increase over the course of almost seven years. While the \nPPI has published guidance that a broader index may be more helpful \nto reference in a contract to avoid large swings on a shorter \nduration (and to which such a swing over a brief duration may \ntrigger additional obligations), the Exchange, in contrast, is \ninstead looking forward to adjust its price to reflect changes in \nthe industry over the past seven years. See supra note 20.\n    \\29\\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-100994 \n(September 10, 2024), 89 FR 75612 (September 16, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-\n2024-79).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Next, the Exchange believes significant investments into, and \nenhanced performance of, the Exchange, in the years following the last \n10 Gb physical port fee increase support the reasonableness of the \nproposed fee increase. These investments enhanced the quality of its \nservices, as measured by, among other things, increased throughput and \nfaster processing speeds. Customers have therefore greatly benefitted \nfrom these investments, while the Exchange's ability to recoup its \ninvestments has been hampered.\n    For example, the Exchange and its affiliated exchanges recently \nlaunched a multi-year initiative to improve Cboe Exchange Platform \nperformance and capacity requirements to increase competitiveness, \nsupport growth and advance a consistent world class platform. The goal \nof the project, among other things, is to provide faster and more \nconsistent order handling and matching performance for options, while \nensuring quicker processing time and supporting increasing volumes and \ncapacity needs. For example, the Exchange recently performed switch \nhardware upgrades. Particularly, the Exchange replaced existing \ncustomer access switches with newer models, which the Exchange believes \nresulted in increased determinism. The recent switch upgrades also \nincreased the Exchange's capacity to accommodate more physical ports by \nnearly 50%. Network bandwidth was also increased nearly two-fold as a \nresult of the upgrades, which among other things, can lead to reduce \nmessage queuing. The Exchange also believes these newer models result \nin less natural variance in the processing of messages. The Exchange \nnotes that it incurred costs associated with purchasing and upgrading \nto these newer models, of which the Exchange has not otherwise passed \nthrough or offset.\n    As of April 1, 2024, market participants also having the option of \nconnecting to a new data center (i.e., Secaucus NY6 Data Center \n(``NY6'')), in addition to the current data centers at NY4 and NY5. The \nExchange made NY6 available in response to customer requests in \nconnection with their need for additional space and capacity. In order \nto make this space available, the Exchange expended significant \nresources to prepare this space, and will also incur ongoing costs with \nrespect to maintaining this offering, including costs related to power, \nspace, fiber, cabinets, panels, labor and maintenance of racks. The \nExchange also incurred a large cost with respect to ensuring NY6 would \nbe latency equalized, as it is for NY4 and NY5.\n    The Exchange also has made various other improvements since the \ncurrent physical port rates were adopted in 2018. For example, the \nExchange has updated its customer portal to provide more transparency \nwith respect to firms' respective connectivity subscriptions, enabling \nthem to better monitor, evaluate and adjust their connections based on \ntheir evolving business needs. The Exchange also performs proactive \naudits on a weekly basis to ensure that all customer cross connects \ncontinue to fall within allowable tolerances for Latency Equalized \nconnections. Accordingly, the Exchange expended, and will continue to \nexpend, resources to innovate and modernize technology so that it may \nbenefit its Members and continue to compete among other equities \nmarkets. The ability to continue to innovate with technology and offer \nnew products to market participants allows the Exchange to remain \ncompetitive in the equities space which currently has 16 equities \nmarkets and potential new entrants. If the Exchange were not able to \nassess incrementally higher fees for its connectivity, it would \neffectively impact how the Exchange manages its technology and hamper \nthe Exchange's ability to continue to invest in and fund access \nservices in a manner that allows it to meet existing and anticipated \naccess demands of market participants. Disapproval of fee changes such \nas the proposal herein, could also have the adverse effect of \ndiscouraging an exchange from improving its operations and implementing \ninnovative technology to the benefit of market participants if it \nbelieves the Commission would later prevent that exchange from \nrecouping costs and monetizing its operational enhancements, thus \nadversely impacting competition as well as the interests of market \nparticipants and investors.\n    Finally, the proposed fee is also the same as is concurrently being \nproposed for its Affiliate Exchanges. Further, Members are able to \nutilize a single port to connect to all of its Affiliate Exchanges and \nwill only be charged one single fee (i.e., a market participant will \nonly be assessed the proposed $8,500 even if it uses that physical port \nto connect to the Exchange and another (or even all 6) of its Affiliate \nExchanges. Particularly, the Exchange believes the proposed monthly per \nport fee is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly discriminatory since \nthe Exchange has determined to not charge multiple fees for the same \nport. Indeed, the Exchange notes that several ports are in fact \npurchased and utilized across one or more of the Exchange's affiliated \nExchanges (and charged only once).\n    The Exchange also believes that the proposed fee change is not \nunfairly discriminatory because it would be assessed uniformly across \nall market participants that purchase the physical ports. The Exchange \nbelieves increasing the fee for 10 Gb physical ports and charging a \nhigher fee as compared to the 1 Gb physical port is equitable as the 1 \nGb physical port is \\1/10\\th the size of the 10 Gb physical port and \ntherefore does not offer access to many of the products and services \noffered by the Exchange (e.g., ability to receive certain market data \nproducts). Thus, the value of the 1 Gb alternative is lower than the \nvalue of the 10 Gb alternative, when measured based on the type of \nExchange access it offers. Moreover, market participants that purchase \n10 Gb physical ports utilize the most bandwidth and therefore consume \nthe most resources from the network. The Exchange also anticipates that \nfirms that utilize 10 Gb ports will benefit the most from the \nExchange's investment in offering NY6 as the Exchange anticipates there \nwill be much higher quantities of 10 Gb physical ports connecting from \nNY6 as compared to 1 Gb ports. Indeed, the Exchange notes that 10 Gb \nphysical ports account for approximately 90% of physical ports across \nthe NY4, NY5, and NY6 data centers, and to date, 80% of new port \nconnections in NY6 are 10 Gb ports. As such, the Exchange believes the \nproposed fee change for 10 Gb physical ports is reasonably and \nappropriately allocated.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed fee change will \nnot impact intramarket competition because it will apply to all \nsimilarly situated Members equally (i.e., all market participants that \nchoose to purchase the 10 Gb physical port). Additionally, the Exchange \ndoes not believe its proposed pricing will\n\n[[Page 21962]]\n\nimpose a barrier to entry to smaller participants and notes that its \nproposed connectivity pricing is associated with relative usage of the \nvarious market participants. For example, market participants with \nmodest capacity needs can continue to buy the less expensive 1 Gb \nphysical port (which cost is not changing) or may choose to obtain \naccess via a third-party re-seller. While pricing may be increased for \nthe larger capacity physical ports, such options provide far more \ncapacity and are purchased by those that consume more resources from \nthe network. Accordingly, the proposed connectivity fees do not favor \ncertain categories of market participants in a manner that would impose \na burden on competition; rather, the allocation reflects the network \nresources consumed by the various size of market participants--lowest \nbandwidth consuming members pay the least, and highest bandwidth \nconsuming members pay the most.\n    The proposed fee change also does not impose a burden on \ncompetition or on other Self-Regulatory Organizations that is not \nnecessary or appropriate. As described above, the Exchange evaluated \nits proposed fee change using objective and stable metric with limited \nvolatility. Utilizing Data Processing PPI over a specified period of \ntime is a reasonable means of recouping a portion of the Exchange's \ninvestment in maintaining and enhancing the connectivity service \nidentified above. The Exchange believes utilizing Data Processing PPI, \na tailored measure of inflation, to increase certain connectivity fees \nto recoup the Exchange's investment in maintaining and enhancing its \nservices and products would not impose a burden on competition.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\30\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\31\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to update its Fee Schedule to provide a \ntemporary 20% discount on fees assessed to Exchange Trading Permit \nHolders and non-Trading Permit Holders that purchase $20,000 or more of \nad hoc purchases of historical Open-Close Data, effective April 23, \n2025 through June 30, 2025. The text of the proposed rule change is \nprovided in Exhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/ctwo/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/ctwo/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at \nthe Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\n[[Page 21963]]\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to update its Fee Schedule to provide a \ntemporary 20% discount on fees assessed to Exchange Trading Permit \nHolders \\3\\ and non-Trading Permit Holders for any single purchase of \nEnd-of-Day Ad-hoc Request (historical data) and/or Intraday Ad-hoc \nRequest (historical data) that meets the minimum purchase requirement \nof at least $20,000 of historical Open-Close Data, effective April 23, \n2025 through June 30, 2025.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See Tenth Amended and Restated Bylaws of Cboe Exchange, Inc. \nThe term ``Trading Permit Holder'' means any individual, \ncorporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity \nauthorized by the Rules that holds a Trading Permit. If a Trading \nPermit Holder is an individual, the Trading Permit Holder may also \nbe referred to as an ``individual Trading Permit Holder.'' If a \nTrading Permit Holder is not an individual, the Trading Permit \nHolder may also be referred to as a ``TPH organization.'' A Trading \nPermit Holder is a ``member'' solely for purposes of the Act; \nhowever, one's status as a Trading Permit Holder does not confer on \nthat Person any ownership interest in the Exchange.\n    \\4\\ The Exchange initially submitted the proposed rule change on \nApril 23, 2025 (SR-C2-2025-008). On May 6, 2025, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, the Exchange currently offers End-of-Day \n(``EOD'') and Intraday Open-Close Data (collectively, ``Open-Close \nData''). EOD Open-Close Data is an end-of-day volume summary of trading \nactivity on the Exchange at the option level by origin (customer, \nprofessional customer, broker-dealer, and market maker), side of the \nmarket (buy or sell), price, and transaction type (opening or closing). \nThe customer and professional customer volume is further broken down \ninto trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 contracts, \ngreater than 199 contracts). The EOD Open-Close Data is proprietary \nExchange trade data and does not include trade data from any other \nexchange. It is also a historical data product and not a real-time data \nfeed. The Exchange also offers Intraday Open-Close Data, which provides \nsimilar information to that of EOD Open-Close Data but is produced and \nupdated every 10 minutes during the trading day. Data is captured in \n``snapshots'' taken every 10 minutes throughout the trading day and is \navailable to subscribers within five minutes of the conclusion of each \n10-minute period.\\5\\ The Intraday Open-Close Data provides a volume \nsummary of trading activity on the Exchange at the option level by \norigin (customer, professional customer, broker-dealer, and market \nmaker), side of the market (buy or sell), and transaction type (opening \nor closing). The customer and professional customer volume are further \nbroken down into trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 \ncontracts, greater than 199 contracts). The Intraday Open-Close Data is \nproprietary Exchange trade data and does not include trade data from \nany other exchange. All Open-Close Data products are completely \nvoluntary products, in that the Exchange is not required by any rule or \nregulation to make this data available and that potential customers may \npurchase it on an ad-hoc basis only if they voluntarily choose to do \nso.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ For example, subscribers to the intraday product will \nreceive the first calculation of intraday data by approximately 9:42 \na.m. ET, which represents data captured from 9:30 a.m. to 9:40 a.m. \nSubscribers will receive the next update at 9:52 a.m., representing \nthe data previously provided together with data captured from 9:40 \na.m. through 9:50 a.m., and so forth. Each update will represent the \naggregate data captured from the current ``snapshot'' and all \nprevious ``snapshots.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe LiveVol, LLC (``LiveVol''), a wholly owned subsidiary of the \nExchange's parent company, Cboe Global Markets, Inc., makes the Open-\nClose Data available for purchase to Trading Permit Holders or non-\nTrading Permit Holders on the LiveVol DataShop website \n(<a href=\"http://datashop.cboe.com\">datashop.cboe.com</a>). Customers may currently purchase Open-Close Data \non a subscription basis (monthly or annually) or by ad hoc request for \na specified month (historical file, e.g., request for Intraday Open-\nClose Data for month of June 2023 or End-of-Day Open-Close Data for \nmonth of June 2023). An ad-hoc request can be for any number of months \nfor which the data is available.\n    Open-Close Data is subject to direct competition from similar end-\nof-day and intraday options trading summaries offered by several other \noptions exchanges.\\6\\ All of these exchanges offer essentially the same \nend-of-day and intraday options trading summary information.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ These substitute products are: Nasdaq PHLX Options Trade \nOutline, Nasdaq Options Trade Outline, ISE Profile, GEMX Trade \nProfile data; open-close data from Cboe Options, EDGX, and BZX; Open \nClose Reports from MIAX Options, Pearl, and Emerald; and NYSE \nOptions Open-Close Volume Summary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to provide a temporary pricing incentive \nprogram in which Trading Permit Holders and non-Trading Permit Holders \nthat purchase historical Open-Close Data will receive a percentage fee \ndiscount where specific purchase thresholds are met. Specifically, the \nExchange proposes to provide a temporary 20% discount for ad-hoc \npurchases of historical Open-Close Data of $20,000 or more.\\7\\ The \nproposed program will apply to all market participants irrespective of \nwhether the market participant is a new or current purchaser; however, \nthe discount cannot be combined with any other discounts offered by the \nExchange, including the academic discount provided for Qualifying \nAcademic Purchasers of historical Open-Close Data. The Exchange intends \nto introduce the discount program beginning April 23, 2025, with the \nprogram remaining in effect through June 30, 2025. The Exchange also \nnotes that it previously adopted the same temporary discount program \nand proposes to update the Fees Schedule with the new program dates \naccordingly.\\8\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ The discount will apply on an order-by-order basis. To \nqualify for the discount, an order must contain End-of-Day Ad-hoc \nRequests (historical data) and/or Intraday Ad-hoc Requests \n(historical data) and must total $20,000 or more; the Exchange will \nnot aggregate purchases made throughout a billing cycle for purposes \nof the incentive program. The discount will apply to the total \npurchase price, once the $20,000 minimum purchase is satisfied (for \nexample, a qualifying order of $25,000 would be discounted to \n$20,000, i.e. receive a 20% discount of $5,000).\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99025 (November 28, \n2023), 88 FR 84007 (December 1, 2023) (SR-C2-2023-023); Securities \nExchange Act Release No. 100427 (June 25, 2024), 89 FR 54552 (July \n1, 2024) (SR-C2-2024-012); and Securities Exchange Act Release No. \n101477 (October 25, 2024), 89 FR 86885 (October 31, 2024) (SR-C2-\n2024-017).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\9\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\10\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and\n\n[[Page 21964]]\n\npractices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster \ncooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, \nclearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and \nfacilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and \nperfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market \nsystem, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. \nAdditionally, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is \nconsistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \\11\\ requirement that the rules of \nan exchange not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between \ncustomers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\11\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory \norganizations (``SROs'') and broker-dealers increased authority and \nflexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was \nbelieved that this authority would expand the amount of data available \nto consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the \nprovision of market data. The Exchange believes the proposed fee \nchanges will further broaden the availability of U.S. option market \ndata to investors consistent with the principles of Regulation NMS. \nOpen-Close Data is designed to help investors understand underlying \nmarket trends to improve the quality of investment decisions. Indeed, \npurchasers of the data may be able to enhance their ability to analyze \noption trade and volume data and create and test trading models and \nanalytical strategies. The Exchange believes Open-Close Data provides a \nvaluable tool that purchasers can use to gain comprehensive insight \ninto the trading activity in a particular series, but also emphasizes \nsuch data is not necessary for trading and as noted above, is entirely \noptional. Moreover, several other exchanges offer a similar data \nproduct which offer same type of data content through end-of-day or \nintraday reports.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See supra note 6.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also operates in a highly competitive environment. \nIndeed, there are currently 18 registered options exchanges that trade \noptions. Based on publicly available information, no single options \nexchange has more than 17% of the market share.\\13\\ The Commission has \nrepeatedly expressed its preference for competition over regulatory \nintervention in determining prices, products, and services in the \nsecurities markets. Particularly, in Regulation NMS, the Commission \nhighlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and \nSRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the \nmarket system ``has been remarkably successful in promoting market \ncompetition in its broader forms that are most important to investors \nand listed companies.'' \\14\\ Making similar data products available to \nmarket participants fosters competition in the marketplace, and \nconstrains the ability of exchanges to charge supracompetitive fees. In \nthe event that a market participant views one exchange's data product \nas more or less attractive than the competition they can and do switch \nbetween similar products. The proposed fees are a result of the \ncompetitive environment, as the Exchange seeks to adopt fees to attract \npurchasers of historical Open-Close Data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See Cboe Global Markets U.S. Options Market Month-to-Date \nVolume Summary (April 21, 2025), available at <a href=\"https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/\">https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/</a>.\n    \\14\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting \nRelease'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed incentive program for any \nTrading Permit Holder or non-Trading Permit Holder who purchases \nhistorical Open-Close Data is reasonable because it will give \npurchasers the ability to use and test the historical Open-Close Data \nat a discounted rate, prior to purchasing additional months or a \nmonthly subscription, and will therefore encourage and promote users to \npurchase the historical Open-Close Data. Further, the proposed discount \nis intended to promote increased use of the Exchange's historical Open-\nClose Data by defraying some of the costs a purchaser would ordinarily \nhave to expend before using the data product. The Exchange believes \nthat the proposed discount is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory \nbecause it will apply equally to all Trading Permit Holders and non-\nTrading Permit Holders who purchase historical Open-Close Data. Lastly, \nthe purchase of this data product is discretionary and not compulsory. \nIndeed, no market participant is required to purchase the historical \nOpen-Close Data, and the Exchange is not required to make the \nhistorical Open-Close Data available to all investors. Potential \npurchasers may request the data at any time if they believe it to be \nvaluable or may decline to purchase such data. As noted above, the \nExchange has previously adopted this discount program at other \ntimes.\\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See supra note 8.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange operates in a \nhighly competitive environment in which the Exchange must continually \nadjust its fees to remain competitive. Because competitors are free to \nmodify their own fees in response, including the adoption of similar \ndiscounts to those fees, the Exchange believes that the degree to which \nfee changes (including discounts and rebates) in this market may impose \nany burden on competition is extremely limited. As discussed above, \nOpen-Close Data is subject to direct competition from several other \noptions exchanges that offer substitutes to Open-Close Data. Moreover, \npurchase of Open-Close Data is optional. It is designed to help \ninvestors understand underlying market trends to improve the quality of \ninvestment decisions but is not necessary to execute a trade. The \nExchange believes that this does not impose any burden on intramarket \ncompetition as the benefit is given to any purchasers who meet the \nminimum purchase amount.\n    The proposed rule changes are grounded in the Exchange's efforts to \ncompete more effectively. In this competitive environment, potential \npurchasers are free to choose which, if any, similar product to \npurchase to satisfy their need for market information. As a result, the \nExchange believes this proposed rule change permits fair competition \namong national securities exchanges. Further, the Exchange believes \nthat these changes will not cause any unnecessary or inappropriate \nburden on intermarket competition, as the proposed incentive program \napplies uniformly to any purchaser of historical Open-Close Data.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII.

(``EDGX'' or ``Exchange'') \nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the \nproposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which \nItems have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing \nthis notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from \ninterested persons.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to update its Fee Schedule to provide a \ntemporary 20% discount on fees assessed to Exchange Members and non-\nMembers that purchase $20,000 or more of ad hoc purchases of historical \nOpen-Close Data, effective April 23, 2025 through June 30, 2025. The \ntext of the proposed rule change is provided in Exhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at \nthe Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to update its Fee Schedule to provide a \ntemporary 20% discount on fees assessed to Exchange Members \\3\\ and \nnon-Members for any single purchase of End-of-Day Ad-hoc Request \n(historical data) and/or Intraday ad-hoc Request (historical data) that \nmeets the minimum purchase requirement of at least $20,000 of \nhistorical Open-Close Data, effective April 23, 2025 through June 30, \n2025.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See Rule 1.5(n) (``Member''). The term ``Member'' shall mean \nany registered broker or dealer that has been admitted to membership \nin the Exchange. A Member will have the status of a ``member'' of \nthe Exchange as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(3) of the Act. \nMembership may be granted to a sole proprietor, partnership, \ncorporation, limited liability company or other organization which \nis a registered broker or dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Act, \nand which has been approved by the Exchange.\n    \\4\\ The Exchange initially submitted the proposed rule change on \nApril 23, 2025 (SR-CboeEDGX-2025-033). On May 6, 2025, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, the Exchange currently offers End-of-Day \n(``EOD'') and Intraday Open-Close Data (collectively, ``Open-Close \nData''). EOD Open-Close Data is an end-of-day volume summary of trading \nactivity on the Exchange at the option level by origin (customer, \nprofessional customer, broker-dealer, and market maker), side of the \nmarket (buy or sell), price, and transaction type (opening or closing). \nThe customer and professional customer volume is further broken down \ninto trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 contracts, \ngreater than 199 contracts). The EOD Open-Close Data is proprietary \nExchange trade data and does not include trade data from any other \nexchange. It is also a historical data product and not a real-time data \nfeed. The Exchange also offers Intraday Open-Close Data, which provides \nsimilar\n\n[[Page 21966]]\n\ninformation to that of EOD Open-Close Data but is produced and updated \nevery 10 minutes during the trading day. Data is captured in \n``snapshots'' taken every 10 minutes throughout the trading day and is \navailable to subscribers within five minutes of the conclusion of each \n10-minute period.\\5\\ The Intraday Open-Close Data provides a volume \nsummary of trading activity on the Exchange at the option level by \norigin (customer, professional customer, broker-dealer, and market \nmaker), side of the market (buy or sell), and transaction type (opening \nor closing). The customer and professional customer volume are further \nbroken down into trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 \ncontracts, greater than 199 contracts). The Intraday Open-Close Data is \nproprietary Exchange trade data and does not include trade data from \nany other exchange. All Open-Close Data products are completely \nvoluntary products, in that the Exchange is not required by any rule or \nregulation to make this data available and that potential customers may \npurchase it on an ad-hoc basis only if they voluntarily choose to do \nso.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ For example, subscribers to the intraday product will \nreceive the first calculation of intraday data by approximately 9:42 \na.m. ET, which represents data captured from 9:30 a.m. to 9:40 a.m. \nSubscribers will receive the next update at 9:52 a.m., representing \nthe data previously provided together with data captured from 9:40 \na.m. through 9:50 a.m., and so forth. Each update will represent the \naggregate data captured from the current ``snapshot'' and all \nprevious ``snapshots.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe LiveVol, LLC (``LiveVol''), a wholly owned subsidiary of the \nExchange's parent company, Cboe Global Markets, Inc., makes the Open-\nClose Data available for purchase to Members and non-Members on the \nLiveVol DataShop website (<a href=\"http://datashop.cboe.com\">datashop.cboe.com</a>). Customers may currently \npurchase Open-Close Data on a subscription basis (monthly or annually) \nor by ad hoc request for a specified month (historical file, e.g., \nrequest for Intraday Open-Close Data for month of December 2023 or End-\nof-Day Open-Close Data for month of December 2023). An ad-hoc request \ncan be for any number of months for which the data is available.\n    Open-Close Data is subject to direct competition from similar end-\nof-day and intraday options trading summaries offered by several other \noptions exchanges.\\6\\ All of these exchanges offer essentially the same \nend-of-day and intraday options trading summary information.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ These substitute products are: Nasdaq PHLX Options Trade \nOutline, Nasdaq Options Trade Outline, ISE Profile, GEMX Trade \nProfile data; open-close data from C2, Cboe Options, and BZX; Open \nClose Reports from MIAX Options, Pearl, and Emerald; and NYSE \nOptions Open-Close Volume Summary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to provide a temporary pricing incentive \nprogram in which Members or Non-Members that purchase historical Open-\nClose Data will receive a percentage fee discount where specific \npurchase thresholds are met. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to \nprovide a temporary 20% discount for ad-hoc purchases of historical \nOpen-Close Data of $20,000 or more.\\7\\ The proposed program will apply \nto all market participants irrespective of whether the market \nparticipant is a new or current purchaser; however, the discount cannot \nbe combined with any other discounts offered by the Exchange, including \nthe academic discount provided for Qualifying Academic Purchasers of \nhistorical Open-Close Data. The Exchange intends to introduce the \ndiscount program beginning April 23, 2025, with the program remaining \nin effect through June 30, 2025. The Exchange also notes that it \npreviously adopted the same temporary discount program and proposes to \nupdate the Fees Schedule with the new program dates accordingly.\\8\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ The discount will apply on an order-by-order basis. To \nqualify for the discount, an order must contain End-of-Day Ad-hoc \nRequests (historical data) and/or Intraday Ad-hoc Requests \n(historical data) and must total $20,000 or more; the Exchange will \nnot aggregate purchases made throughout a billing cycle for purposes \nof the incentive program. The discount will apply to the total \npurchase price, once the $20,000 minimum purchase is satisfied (for \nexample, a qualifying order of $25,000 would be discounted to \n$20,000, i.e., receive a 20% discount of $5,000).\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99026 (November 28, \n2023), 88 FR 84023 (December 1, 2023) (SR-CboeEDGX-2023-070); \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 100352 (June 17, 2024), 89 FR \n52521 (June 24, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGX-2024-033) and Securities Exchange \nAct Release No. 101448 (October 25, 2024), 89 FR 86891 (October 31, \n2024) (SR-CboeEDGX-2024-065).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\9\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\10\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\11\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\11\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory \norganizations (``SROs'') and broker-dealers increased authority and \nflexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was \nbelieved that this authority would expand the amount of data available \nto consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the \nprovision of market data. The Exchange believes the proposed fee \nchanges will further broaden the availability of U.S. option market \ndata to investors consistent with the principles of Regulation NMS. \nOpen-Close Data is designed to help investors understand underlying \nmarket trends to improve the quality of investment decisions. Indeed, \npurchasers of the data may be able to enhance their ability to analyze \noption trade and volume data and create and test trading models and \nanalytical strategies. The Exchange believes Open-Close Data provides a \nvaluable tool that purchasers can use to gain comprehensive insight \ninto the trading activity in a particular series, but also emphasizes \nsuch data is not necessary for trading and as noted above, is entirely \noptional. Moreover, several other exchanges offer a similar data \nproduct which offer same type of data content through end-of-day or \nintraday reports.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See supra note 6.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also operates in a highly competitive environment. \nIndeed, there are currently 18 registered options exchanges that trade \noptions. Based on publicly available information, no single options \nexchange has more than 17% of the market share.\\13\\ The Commission has \nrepeatedly expressed its preference for competition over regulatory \nintervention in determining prices, products, and services in the \nsecurities markets. Particularly, in Regulation NMS, the Commission \nhighlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and \nSRO revenues and, also, recognized that\n\n[[Page 21967]]\n\ncurrent regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably \nsuccessful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that \nare most important to investors and listed companies.'' \\14\\ Making \nsimilar data products available to market participants fosters \ncompetition in the marketplace, and constrains the ability of exchanges \nto charge supracompetitive fees. In the event that a market participant \nviews one exchange's data product as more or less attractive than the \ncompetition they can and do switch between similar products. The \nproposed fees are a result of the competitive environment, as the \nExchange seeks to adopt fees to attract purchasers of historical Open-\nClose Data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See Cboe Global Markets U.S. Options Market Month-to-Date \nVolume Summary (April 21, 2025), available at <a href=\"https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/\">https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/</a>.\n    \\14\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting \nRelease'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed incentive program for any \nMember or non-Member who purchases historical Open-Close Data is \nreasonable because it will give purchasers the ability to use and test \nthe historical Open-Close Data at a discounted rate, prior to \npurchasing additional months or a monthly subscription, and will \ntherefore encourage and promote users to purchase the historical Open-\nClose Data. Further, the proposed discount is intended to promote \nincreased use of the Exchange's historical Open-Close Data by defraying \nsome of the costs a purchaser would ordinarily have to expend before \nusing the data product. The Exchange believes that the proposed \ndiscount is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because it will \napply equally to all Members and non-Members who purchase historical \nOpen-Close Data. Lastly, the purchase of this data product is \ndiscretionary and not compulsory. Indeed, no market participant is \nrequired to purchase the historical Open-Close Data, and the Exchange \nis not required to make the historical Open-Close Data available to all \ninvestors. Potential purchasers may request the data at any time if \nthey believe it to be valuable or may decline to purchase such data. As \nnoted above, the Exchange has previously adopted the same temporary \ndiscount program.\\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See supra note 10.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange operates in a \nhighly competitive environment in which the Exchange must continually \nadjust its fees to remain competitive. Because competitors are free to \nmodify their own fees in response, including the adoption of similar \ndiscounts to those fees, the Exchange believes that the degree to which \nfee changes (including discounts and rebates) in this market may impose \nany burden on competition is extremely limited. As discussed above, \nOpen-Close Data is subject to direct competition from several other \noptions exchanges that offer substitutes to Open-Close Data. Moreover, \npurchase of Open-Close Data is optional. It is designed to help \ninvestors understand underlying market trends to improve the quality of \ninvestment decisions, but is not necessary to execute a trade. The \nExchange believes that this does not impose any burden on intramarket \ncompetition as the benefit is given to any purchasers who meet the \nminimum purchase amount.\n    The proposed rule changes are grounded in the Exchange's efforts to \ncompete more effectively. In this competitive environment, potential \npurchasers are free to choose which, if any, similar product to \npurchase to satisfy their need for market information.

Further, the Exchange believes \nthat these changes will not cause any unnecessary or inappropriate \nburden on intermarket competition, as the proposed incentive program \napplies uniformly to any purchaser of historical Open-Close Data.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\16\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\17\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission will institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or \ndisapproved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).\n    \\17\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.

The proposed rule change \nis available on the Exchange's website at <a href=\"http://www.nyse.com\">www.nyse.com</a>, at the \nprincipal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public \nReference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization \nincluded statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the \nproposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the \nproposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at \nthe places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared \nsummaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most \nsignificant parts of such statements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to enhance the content of the NYSE Texas \nAggregated Lite market data product offering.\n    NYSE Texas Aggregated Lite is a NYSE Texas-only frequency-based \ndepth of book market data feed of the NYSE Texas's limit order book for \nup to ten (10) price levels for securities traded on the Exchange and \nfor which the Exchange reports quotes and trades under the Consolidated \nTape Association Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. NYSE Texas Aggregated \nLite is a compilation of limit order data that the Exchange provides to \nvendors and subscribers. The NYSE Texas Aggregated Lite data feed is \nupdated no less frequently than once per second. The NYSE Texas \nAggregated Lite includes depth of book order data as well as security \nstatus messages. The security status message informs subscribers of \nchanges in the status of a specific security, such as trading halts, \nshort sale restriction, etc.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99691 (March 7, \n2024), 89 FR 18468 (March 13, 2024) (SR-NYSECHX-2024-08) (Notice of \nFiling and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To \nEstablish the NYSE Chicago Aggregated Lite Market Data Feed). On \nMarch 28, 2025, NYSE Chicago, Inc. equities market became NYSE \nTexas, Inc. Pursuant to the formation of NYSE Texas, Inc., NYSE \nChicago Aggregated Lite is now known as NYSE Texas Aggregated Lite. \nSee Securities Exchange Act Release No.102507 (February 28, 2025), \n90 FR 11445 (March 6, 2025) (SR-NYSECHX-2025-01) (Notice of Filing \nand Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Repeal the \nExchange's Certificate of Incorporation; Adopt the Certificate of \nFormation of NYSE Texas, Inc.; Amend the Exchange's By-Laws, Rules, \nand Certain Fee Schedules; and Amend the Certificate of \nIncorporation and By-Laws of the Exchange's Holding Company To \nReflect the Conversion of the Exchange to a Texas Corporation and \nthe Renaming of NYSE Chicago Holdings, Inc.).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to include Auction Imbalance Information in \nthe NYSE Texas Aggregated Lite product in connection with the \nintroduction of auctions on NYSE Texas.\\5\\ In addition to the data \nelements described above, the NYSE Texas Aggregated Lite data feed \nwould also include real-time order imbalances that accumulate prior to \nthe opening of trading on the Exchange, prior to any re-opening auction \nafter a halt, and prior to the close of trading on the Exchange.\\6\\ As \nproposed, an enhanced NYSE Texas Aggregated Lite data feed would \ncontain aggregate information about orders that are subject to \nexecution at the market's opening or closing price, as the case may be, \nand would represent issues that are likely to be of particular trading \ninterest at the opening or closing. The NYSE Texas Aggregated Lite \nmarket data product would provide Auction Imbalance Information with \nrespect to all symbols listed on the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See SR-NYSETEX-2025-08 (Proposed Rule Change to Adopt Rule \n7.35 Regarding Auctions). NYSE Texas Rule 7.35(a)(4) defines Auction \nImbalance Information as the information disseminated by the \nExchange for an auction. As set forth in NYSE Texas Rule 7.35, \nAuction Imbalance information includes, if applicable, the Total \nImbalance, Market Imbalance, Indicative Match Price and Matched \nVolume, each as defined in NYSE Texas Rule 7.35(a).\n    \\6\\ NYSE Texas order imbalance information is not currently \navailable through any of the Exchange's current data feeds as NYSE \nTexas does not currently provide for the operation of auctions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange will announce the date that an enhanced NYSE Texas \nAggregated Lite data feed will be available through a Trader Update.\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) \\7\\ of the \nAct, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) \\8\\ of \nthe Act, in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent \nand manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable \nprinciples of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with \npersons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, to remove \nimpediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and \na national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the \npublic interest, and it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination \namong customers, brokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\8\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes the proposal would facilitate transactions in \nsecurities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free \nand open market and a national market system by providing market \nparticipants an additional means to access information about order \nimbalance data disseminated by the Exchange. The proposal would improve \nthe content included in the NYSE Texas Aggregated Lite data feed and \nprovide investors with an additional option for accessing information \nthat may help to inform their trading decisions. The proposed inclusion \nof order imbalance data in the NYSE Texas Aggregated Lite data feed \nwould also be consistent with the data feeds offered by the Exchange's \naffiliates, New York Stock Exchange, LLC (``NYSE''), NYSE Arca, Inc. \n(``NYSE\n\n[[Page 21969]]\n\nArca'') and NYSE American, LLC (``NYSE American''),\\9\\ and with a data \nfeed offered by the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''),\\10\\ all of \nwhich provide order imbalance information with respect to symbols \nlisted on each of those exchanges.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ See Securities Act Release Nos. 99689 (March 7, 2024), 89 FR \n18466 (March 13, 2024) (SR-NYSE-24-12) (Notice of Filing and \nImmediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Establish the \nNYSE Aggregated Lite Market Data Feed); 99690 (March 7, 2024), 89 FR \n18445 (March 13, 2024) (SR-NYSEAMER-2024-14) (Notice of Filing and \nImmediate Effectiveness of Proposed Change To Establish the NYSE \nAmerican Aggregated Lite Market Data Feed); and 99713 (March 12, \n2024), 89 FR 19381 (March 18, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-2024-22) (Notice of \nFiling and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To \nEstablish the NYSE Arca Aggregated Lite Market Data Feed).\n    \\10\\ See Nasdaq TotalView, <a href=\"https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/NTV\">https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/NTV</a> \n(displays the full order book depth for Nasdaq market participants \nand also disseminates the Net Order Imbalance Indicator (NOII) for \nthe Nasdaq Opening and Closing Crosses and Nasdaq IPO/Halt Cross).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory \norganizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to \noffer new and unique market data to consumers of such data. It was \nbelieved that this authority would expand the amount of data available \nto users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and \ncompetition for the provision of market data. The Exchange believes \nthat the data product modification proposed herein, the inclusion of \norder imbalance data, is precisely the sort of market data product \nenhancement that the Commission envisioned when it adopted Regulation \nNMS. The Commission concluded that Regulation NMS would itself further \nthe Act's goals of facilitating efficiency and competition:\n\n    [E]fficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the \ndata beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the \nNBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to \nreceive (and pay for) such data. The Commission also believes that \nefficiency is promoted when broker-dealers may choose to receive \n(and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal \nanalysis of the need for such data.\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting \nRelease'').\n\n    By removing ``unnecessary regulatory restrictions'' on the ability \nof exchanges to sell their own data, Regulation NMS advanced the goals \nof the Act and the principles reflected in its legislative history.\n    The Exchange notes that the existence of alternatives to the \nExchange's product, including real-time consolidated data, free delayed \nconsolidated data, and proprietary data from other sources, ensures \nthat the Exchange is not unreasonably discriminatory because vendors \nand subscribers can elect these alternatives as their individual \nbusiness cases warrant.\n    Lastly, the proposal would not permit unfair discrimination because \nthe enhanced product would be available to all of the Exchange's \nvendors and subscribers on an equivalent basis at no cost as the \nExchange currently does not charge a fee for subscribing to the NYSE \nTexas Aggregated Lite data feed.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Rather, the proposal would \nenhance competition by enabling the Exchange to better compete with the \nExchange's affiliates, NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, and with \nNasdaq, all of which offer a similar product that includes order \nimbalance data for symbols listed on each of those exchanges.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See notes 9-10, supra.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The market for proprietary data products is currently competitive \nand inherently contestable because there is fierce competition for the \ninputs necessary to the creation of proprietary data. Numerous \nexchanges compete with each other for listings, trades, and market data \nitself, providing virtually limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs \nwho wish to produce and distribute their own market data. This \nproprietary data is produced by each individual exchange, as well as \nother entities (such as internalizing broker-dealers and various forms \nof alternative trading systems, including dark pools and electronic \ncommunication networks), in a vigorously competitive market. It is \ncommon for market participants to further and exploit this competition \nby sending their order flow and transaction reports to multiple \nmarkets, rather than providing them all to a single market.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the \nproposed rule change.\n\nD. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \\13\\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\\14\\ \nBecause the proposed rule change does not (i) significantly affect the \nprotection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any \nsignificant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative prior to \n30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as \nthe Commission may designate, if consistent with the protection of \ninvestors and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become \neffective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \\15\\ and Rule \n19b-4(f)(6)(iii) thereunder.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).\n    \\14\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).\n    \\15\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).\n    \\16\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \nrequires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission \nwritten notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along \nwith a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at \nleast five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed \nrule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. \nThe Exchange has fulfilled this requirement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \\17\\ normally \ndoes not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the \nfiling. However, pursuant to Rule 19b4(f)(6)(iii),\\18\\ the Commission \nmay designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the \nprotection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has \nrequested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so that \nthe proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The Exchange \nbelieves that waiver of the 30-day operative delay would allow the \nExchange to implement the proposed changes as soon as the technology \nassociated with the proposed changes is available, which is anticipated \nto be less than 30 days from the date of this filing.\\19\\ The \nCommission believes that waiver of the operative delay would be \nconsistent with the protection of investors and the public interest \nbecause this proposed rule change does not present any novel issues and \nit would provide investors with an\n\n[[Page 21970]]\n\nadditional option for accessing potentially helpful information that \ncould inform their trading decisions as soon as the technology related \nto the enhancement of the NYSE Texas Aggregated Lite data feed is \nimplemented. Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the 30-day \noperative delay and designates the proposed rule change as operative \nupon filing.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).\n    \\18\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).\n    \\19\\ See note 6, supra.\n    \\20\\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, \nthe Commission also has considered the proposed rule's impact on \nefficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. \n78c(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule \nchange, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.\n\nIV. Solicitation of Comments\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and \narguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with the Act. Comments may be submitted by any of \nthe following methods:\n\nElectronic Comments\n\n    <bullet> Use the Commission's internet comment form (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml\">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml</a>); or\n    <bullet> Send an email to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83f1f6efe6aee0eceeeee6edf7f0c3f0e6e0ade4ecf5\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f785829b92da94989a9a92998384b7849294d9909881\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

The NYSE \nTexas Order Imbalances product would be a real-time data feed of the \ninformation that the Exchange would provide in advance of an auction.\n    The Exchange is establishing the NYSE Texas Order Imbalances \nproduct in connection with the introduction of auctions on NYSE \nTexas.\\4\\ NYSE Texas Order Imbalances would be a data feed of real-time \norder imbalances that accumulate prior to the opening of trading on the \nExchange, prior to any re-opening auction after a halt, and prior to \nthe close of trading on the Exchange.\\5\\ The data feed would contain \naggregate information about orders that are subject to execution at the \nmarket's opening or closing price, as the case may be, and would \nrepresent issues that are likely to be of particular trading interest \nat the opening or closing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See SR-NYSETEX-2025-08 (Proposed Rule Change to Adopt Rule \n7.35 Regarding Auctions).\n    \\5\\ NYSE Texas order imbalance information is not currently \navailable through any of the Exchange's current data feeds as NYSE \nTexas does not currently provide for the operation of auctions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    NYSE Texas Rule 7.35(a)(4)(C) provides that the Exchange will \ndisseminate Auction Imbalance\n\n[[Page 21971]]\n\nInformation via a proprietary data feed during the times specified in \nthe rule, and through this filing, the Exchange proposes to establish \nthe NYSE Texas Order Imbalances feed as the proprietary data feed to \nwhich NYSE Texas Rule 7.35(a)(4)(C) refers.\n    NYSE Texas Rule 7.35(a)(4) defines Auction Imbalance Information as \nthe information disseminated by the Exchange for an auction. As set \nforth in NYSE Texas Rule 7.35, Auction Imbalance information includes, \nif applicable, the Total Imbalance, Market Imbalance, Indicative Match \nPrice and Matched Volume, each as defined in NYSE Texas Rule 7.35(a). \nThe Auction Imbalance Information would be disseminated on a time frame \nspecified in NYSE Texas Rule 7.35. The NYSE Texas Order Imbalances \nmarket data product would provide Auction Imbalance Information with \nrespect to all symbols listed on the Exchange.\n    The Exchange proposes to offer this order imbalance information as \na stand-alone market data product in order to provide all market \nparticipants with an opportunity to obtain information regarding \nopening and closing imbalances on the Exchange. The Exchange believes \nthat the NYSE Texas Order Imbalances data feed would benefit market \nparticipants by facilitating their prompt access to widespread order \nimbalance information.\n    The Exchange proposes to offer the NYSE Texas Order Imbalances \nproduct through the Exchange's Liquidity Center Network (``LCN''), a \nlocal area network in the Exchange's Mahwah, New Jersey data center \nthat is available to users of the Exchange's co-location services. The \nExchange also would offer the NYSE Texas Order Imbalances product \nthrough the ICE Global Network (``IGN''), through which all other users \nand members access the Exchange's trading and execution systems and \nother proprietary market data products.\n    The Exchange does not currently intend to charge a fee to subscribe \nto NYSE Texas Order Imbalances. The Exchange will file a separate rule \nfiling to establish fees for NYSE Texas Order Imbalances if it \ndetermines to adopt such fees. The Exchange will announce the date that \nNYSE Texas Order Imbalances will be available through a Trader Update.\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent \nwith Section 6(b) \\6\\ of the Act, in general, and furthers the \nobjectives of Section 6(b)(5) \\7\\ of the Act, in particular, in that it \nis designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, \nto promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster \ncooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest, and it is not \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or \ndealers. This proposal is in keeping with those principles in that it \npromotes increased transparency through the dissemination of the NYSE \nTexas Order Imbalances market data product to those interested in \nreceiving it.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with Section \n6(b)(5) of the Act because it protects investors and the public \ninterest and promotes just and equitable principles of trade by \nproviding investors with new options for receiving market data as \nrequested by market data vendors and subscribers. The proposed rule \nchange would benefit investors by facilitating their prompt access to \nthe real-time information contained in the NYSE Texas Order Imbalances \nmarket data product.\n    The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is \nconsistent with Section 11(A) of the Act \\8\\ in that it supports (i) \nfair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and \nbetween exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and \n(ii) the availability of information with respect to quotations for and \ntransactions in securities to brokers, dealers, and investors. \nFurthermore, the proposed rule change is consistent with Rule 603 of \nRegulation NMS,\\9\\ which provides that any national securities exchange \nthat distributes information with respect to quotations for or \ntransactions in an NMS stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably \ndiscriminatory. The NYSE Texas Order Imbalances market data product \nwould be accessed and subscribed to on a voluntary basis, in that \nneither the Exchange nor market data vendors are required by any rule \nor regulation to make this data available. Accordingly, vendors and \nsubscribers can discontinue their use at any time and for any reason.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ 15 U.S.C. 78k-1.\n    \\9\\ See 17 CFR 242.603.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory \norganizations (``SROs'') and broker dealers increased authority and \nflexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such \ndata. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of \ndata available to users and consumers of such data and also spur \ninnovation and competition for the provision of market data. The \nExchange believes that the NYSE Texas Order Imbalances market data \nproduct is precisely the sort of market data product that the \nCommission envisioned when it adopted Regulation NMS. The Commission \nconcluded that Regulation NMS would itself further the Act's goals of \nfacilitating efficiency and competition:\n\n    Efficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the \ndata beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the \nNBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to \nreceive (and pay for) such data. The Commission also believes that \nefficiency is promoted when broker-dealers may choose to receive \n(and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal \nanalysis of the need for such data.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting \nRelease'').\n\n    In addition, NYSE Texas Order Imbalances market data product \nremoves impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open \nmarket and a national market system by providing investors with \nalternative market data and would compete with similar market data \nproducts currently offered by the Exchange's affiliates, New York Stock \nExchange LLC (``NYSE''), NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca'') and NYSE \nAmerican LLC (``NYSE American''),\\11\\ and by the Nasdaq Stock Market \n(``Nasdaq'').\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See Securities Act Release Nos. 59543 (March 9, 2009), 74 \nFR 11159 (March 16, 2009) (SR-NYSE-2008-132) (NYSE Order \nImbalances); 76968 (January 22, 2016), 81 FR 4689 (January 27, 2016) \n(SR-NYSEArca-2016-10) (NYSE Arca Order Imbalances); and 59743 (April \n9, 2009), 74 FR 17699 (April 16, 2009) (SR-NYSEAmex-2009-11) (NYSE \nAmex Order Imbalances n/k/a NYSE American Order Imbalances).\n    \\12\\ See Nasdaq TotalView, <a href=\"https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/NTV\">https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/NTV</a> \n(displays the full order book depth for Nasdaq market participants \nand also disseminates the Net Order Imbalance Indicator (NOII) for \nthe Nasdaq Opening and Closing Crosses and Nasdaq IPO/Halt Cross).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes that the existence of alternatives to the \nExchange's proposed product, including real-time consolidated data, \nfree delayed consolidated data, and proprietary data from other \nsources, ensures that the Exchange is not unreasonably discriminatory \nbecause vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives as their \nindividual business cases warrant. This proposed new data feed\n\n[[Page 21972]]\n\nwould provide investors with new options for receiving market data, \nwhich was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by \nRegulation NMS.\\13\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See Regulation NMS Adopting Release, supra, at 37503.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The NYSE Texas Order Imbalances data feed will help to protect a \nfree and open market by providing additional data to the marketplace \nand by giving investors greater choices. In addition, the proposal \nwould not permit unfair discrimination because the data feed would be \navailable to all vendors and subscribers through both LCN and IGN.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\\14\\ the Exchange \ndoes not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden \non competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of \nthe purposes of the Act. Because other exchanges already offer similar \nproducts, the Exchange's proposed NYSE Texas Order Imbalances market \ndata product will enhance competition. The NYSE Texas Order Imbalances \nproduct will foster competition by providing an alternative to similar \nproducts offered by other exchanges, including order imbalances \nproducts offered by the Exchange's affiliates, NYSE, NYSE Arca and NYSE \nAmerican,\\15\\ and by Nasdaq.\\16\\ The NYSE Texas Order Imbalances market \ndata product would provide investors with a new option for receiving \nmarket data, which was a primary goal of the market data amendments \nadopted by Regulation NMS.\\17\\ Thus, the Exchange believes the proposed \nrule change is necessary to permit fair competition among national \nsecurities exchanges.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).\n    \\15\\ See note 11, supra.\n    \\16\\ See note 12, supra.\n    \\17\\ See Regulation NMS Adopting Release, supra, at 37503.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the \nproposed rule change.\n\nD. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \\18\\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\\19\\ \nBecause the proposed rule change does not (i) significantly affect the \nprotection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any \nsignificant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative prior to \n30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as \nthe Commission may designate, if consistent with the protection of \ninvestors and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become \neffective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \\20\\ and Rule \n19b-4(f)(6)(iii) thereunder.\\21\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).\n    \\19\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).\n    \\20\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).\n    \\21\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \nrequires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission \nwritten notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along \nwith a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at \nleast five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed \nrule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. \nThe Exchange has fulfilled this requirement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \\22\\ normally \ndoes not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the \nfiling. However, pursuant to Rule 19b4(f)(6)(iii),\\23\\ the Commission \nmay designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the \nprotection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has \nrequested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so that \nthe proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The Exchange \nbelieves that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is appropriate \nbecause the availability of the NYSE Texas Order Imbalances present no \nnovel issues and will provide investors with a stand-alone, alternative \nto currently available proprietary data products. The Commission \nbelieves that waiver of the operative delay would be consistent with \nthe protection of investors and the public interest because this \nproposed rule change does not present any novel issues and it would \nprovide investors with an alternative option for accessing potentially \nhelpful information that could inform their trading decisions as soon \nas practicable. Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the 30-day \noperative delay and designates the proposed rule change as operative \nupon filing.\\24\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).\n    \\23\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).\n    \\24\\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, \nthe Commission also has considered the proposed rule's impact on \nefficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. \n78c(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule \nchange, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.\n\nIV. Solicitation of Comments\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and \narguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with the Act. Comments may be submitted by any of \nthe following methods:\n\nElectronic Comments\n\n    <bullet> Use the Commission's internet comment form (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml\">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml</a>); or\n    <bullet> Send an email to <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c5e594049014f4341414942585f6c5f494f024b435a\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f183849d94dc929e9c9c949f8582b1829492df969e87\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

(``Cboe Options'' or ``Exchange'') \nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the \nproposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which \nItems have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing \nthis notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from \ninterested persons.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to update its Fee Schedule to provide a \ntemporary 20% discount on fees assessed to Exchange Trading Permit \nHolders and non-Trading Permit Holders that purchase $20,000 or more of \nad hoc purchases of historical Open-Close Data, effective April 23, \n2025 through June 30, 2025. The text of the proposed rule change is \nprovided in Exhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/CBOELegalRegulatoryHome.aspx\">http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/CBOELegalRegulatoryHome.aspx</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the \nSecretary, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to update its Fee Schedule to provide a \ntemporary 20% discount on fees assessed to Exchange Trading Permit \nHolders \\3\\ and non-Trading Permit Holders for any single purchase of \nEnd-of-Day Ad-hoc Request (historical data) and/or Intraday Ad-hoc \nRequest (historical data) that meets the minimum purchase requirement \nof at least $20,000 of historical Open-Close Data, effective April 23, \n2025 through June 30, 2025.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See Tenth Amended and Restated Bylaws of Cboe Exchange, Inc. \nThe term ``Trading Permit Holder'' means any individual, \ncorporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity \nauthorized by the Rules that holds a Trading Permit. If a Trading \nPermit Holder is an individual, the Trading Permit Holder may also \nbe referred to as an ``individual Trading Permit Holder.'' If a \nTrading Permit Holder is not an individual, the Trading Permit \nHolder may also be referred to as a ``TPH organization.'' A Trading \nPermit Holder is a ``member'' solely for purposes of the Act; \nhowever, one's status as a Trading Permit Holder does not confer on \nthat Person any ownership interest in the Exchange.\n    \\4\\ The Exchange initially submitted the proposed rule change on \nApril 23, 2025 (SR-CBOE-2025-029). On May 6, 2025, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, the Exchange currently offers End-of-Day \n(``EOD'') and Intraday Open-Close Data (collectively, ``Open-Close \nData''). EOD Open-Close Data is an end-of-day volume summary of trading \nactivity on the Exchange at the option level by origin (customer, \nprofessional customer, broker-dealer, and market maker), side of the \nmarket (buy or sell), price, and transaction type (opening or closing). \nThe customer and professional customer volume is further broken down \ninto trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 contracts, \ngreater than 199 contracts). The EOD Open-Close Data is proprietary \nExchange trade data and does not include trade data from any other \nexchange. It is also a historical data product and not a real-time data \nfeed. The Exchange also offers Intraday Open-Close Data, which provides \nsimilar information to that of EOD Open-Close Data but is produced and \nupdated every 10 minutes during the trading day. Data is captured in \n``snapshots'' taken every 10 minutes throughout the trading day and is \navailable to subscribers within five minutes of the conclusion of each \n10-minute period.\\5\\ The Intraday Open-Close Data provides a volume \nsummary of trading activity on the Exchange at the option level by \norigin (customer, professional customer, broker-dealer, and market \nmaker), side of the market (buy or sell), and transaction type (opening \nor closing). The customer and professional customer volume are further \nbroken down into trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 \ncontracts, greater than 199 contracts). The Intraday Open-Close Data is \nproprietary Exchange trade data and does not include trade data from \nany other exchange. All Open-Close Data products are completely \nvoluntary products, in that the Exchange is not required by any rule or \nregulation to make this data available and that potential customers may \npurchase it on an ad-hoc basis only if they voluntarily choose to do \nso.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ For example, subscribers to the intraday product will \nreceive the first calculation of intraday data by approximately 9:42 \na.m. ET, which represents data captured from 9:30 a.m. to 9:40 a.m. \nSubscribers will receive the next update at 9:52 a.m., representing \nthe data previously provided together with data captured from 9:40 \na.m. through 9:50 a.m., and so forth. Each update will represent the \naggregate data captured from the current ``snapshot'' and all \nprevious ``snapshots.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe LiveVol, LLC (``LiveVol''), a wholly owned subsidiary of the \nExchange's parent company, Cboe Global Markets, Inc., makes the Open-\nClose Data available for purchase to Trading Permit Holders and non-\nTrading Permit Holders on the LiveVol DataShop website \n(<a href=\"http://datashop.cboe.com\">datashop.cboe.com</a>). Customers may currently purchase Open-Close Data \non a subscription basis (monthly or annually) or by ad hoc request for \na specified month (historical file, e.g., request for Intraday Open-\nClose Data for month of June 2024 or End-of-Day Open-Close Data for \nmonth of June 2024). An ad-hoc request can be\n\n[[Page 21974]]\n\nfor any number of months for which the data is available.\n    Open-Close Data is subject to direct competition from similar end-\nof-day and intraday options trading summaries offered by several other \noptions exchanges.\\6\\ All of these exchanges offer essentially the same \nend-of-day and intraday options trading summary information.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ These substitute products are: Nasdaq PHLX Options Trade \nOutline, Nasdaq Options Trade Outline, ISE Profile, GEMX Trade \nProfile data; open-close data from C2, EDGX, and BZX; Open Close \nReports from MIAX Options, Pearl, and Emerald; and NYSE Options \nOpen-Close Volume Summary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to provide a temporary pricing incentive \nprogram in which Trading Permit Holders or non-Trading Permit Holders \nthat purchase historical Open-Close Data will receive a percentage fee \ndiscount where specific purchase thresholds are met. Specifically, the \nExchange proposes to provide a temporary 20% discount for ad-hoc \npurchases of historical Open-Close Data of $20,000 or more.\\7\\ The \nproposed program will apply to all market participants irrespective of \nwhether the market participant is a new or current purchaser; however, \nthe discount cannot be combined with any other discounts offered by the \nExchange, including the academic discount provided for Qualifying \nAcademic Purchasers of historical Open-Close Data. The Exchange intends \nto introduce the discount program beginning April 23, 2025, with the \nprogram remaining in effect through June 30, 2025. The Exchange also \nnotes that it previously adopted the same temporary discount program \nand proposes to update the Fees Schedule with the new program dates \naccordingly.\\8\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ The discount will apply on an order-by-order basis. To \nqualify for the discount, an order must contain End-of-Day Ad-hoc \nRequests (historical data) and/or Intraday Ad-hoc Requests \n(historical data) and must total $20,000 or more; the Exchange will \nnot aggregate purchases made throughout a billing cycle for purposes \nof the incentive program. The discount will apply to the total \npurchase price, once the $20,000 minimum purchase is satisfied (for \nexample, a qualifying order of $25,000 would be discounted to \n$20,000, i.e. receive a 20% discount of $5,000).\n    \\8\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99028 (November 28, \n2023), 88 FR 84002 (December 1, 2023) (SR-CBOE-2023-061); Securities \nExchange Act Release No. 100370 (June 18, 2024), 89 FR 53148 (June \n25, 2024) (SR-CBOE-2024-025); and Securities Exchange Act Release \nNo. 101509 (November 4, 2024), 89 FR 88845 (November 8, 2024) (SR-\nCBOE-2024-049).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\9\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\10\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\11\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\11\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory \norganizations (``SROs'') and broker-dealers increased authority and \nflexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was \nbelieved that this authority would expand the amount of data available \nto consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the \nprovision of market data. The Exchange believes the proposed fee \nchanges will further broaden the availability of U.S. option market \ndata to investors consistent with the principles of Regulation NMS. \nOpen-Close Data is designed to help investors understand underlying \nmarket trends to improve the quality of investment decisions. Indeed, \npurchasers of the data may be able to enhance their ability to analyze \noption trade and volume data and create and test trading models and \nanalytical strategies. The Exchange believes Open-Close Data provides a \nvaluable tool that purchasers can use to gain comprehensive insight \ninto the trading activity in a particular series, but also emphasizes \nsuch data is not necessary for trading and as noted above, is entirely \noptional. Moreover, several other exchanges offer a similar data \nproduct which offer same type of data content through end-of-day or \nintraday reports.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See supra note 6.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also operates in a highly competitive environment. \nIndeed, there are currently 18 registered options exchanges that trade \noptions. Based on publicly available information, no single options \nexchange has more than 17% of the market share.\\13\\ The Commission has \nrepeatedly expressed its preference for competition over regulatory \nintervention in determining prices, products, and services in the \nsecurities markets. Particularly, in Regulation NMS, the Commission \nhighlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and \nSRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the \nmarket system ``has been remarkably successful in promoting market \ncompetition in its broader forms that are most important to investors \nand listed companies.'' \\14\\ Making similar data products available to \nmarket participants fosters competition in the marketplace, and \nconstrains the ability of exchanges to charge supracompetitive fees. In \nthe event that a market participant views one exchange's data product \nas more or less attractive than the competition they can and do switch \nbetween similar products. The proposed fees are a result of the \ncompetitive environment, as the Exchange seeks to adopt fees to attract \npurchasers of historical Open-Close Data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See Cboe Global Markets U.S. Options Market Month-to-Date \nVolume Summary (April 21, 2025), available at <a href=\"https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/\">https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/</a>.\n    \\14\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting \nRelease'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed incentive program for any \nTrading Permit Holder or non-Trading Permit Holder who purchases \nhistorical Open-Close Data is reasonable because it will give \npurchasers the ability to use and test the historical Open-Close Data \nat a discounted rate, prior to purchasing additional months or a \nmonthly subscription, and will therefore encourage and promote users to \npurchase the historical Open-Close Data. Further, the proposed discount \nis intended to promote increased use of the Exchange's historical Open-\nClose Data by defraying some of the costs a purchaser would ordinarily \nhave to expend before using the data product. The Exchange believes \nthat the proposed discount is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory \nbecause it will apply equally to all Trading Permit Holders and non-\nTrading Permit Holders who purchase historical Open-Close Data. Lastly, \nthe purchase of this data product is discretionary and not compulsory. \nIndeed, no market participant is required to purchase the historical \nOpen-Close Data, and the Exchange is not required to make the \nhistorical Open-Close Data available to all investors. Potential \npurchasers may\n\n[[Page 21975]]\n\nrequest the data at any time if they believe it to be valuable or may \ndecline to purchase such data. As noted above, the Exchange has \npreviously adopted this discount program at other times.\\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See supra note 8.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange operates in a \nhighly competitive environment in which the Exchange must continually \nadjust its fees to remain competitive. Because competitors are free to \nmodify their own fees in response, including the adoption of similar \ndiscounts to those fees, the Exchange believes that the degree to which \nfee changes (including discounts and rebates) in this market may impose \nany burden on competition is extremely limited. As discussed above, \nOpen-Close Data is subject to direct competition from several other \noptions exchanges that offer substitutes to Open-Close Data. Moreover, \npurchase of Open-Close Data is optional. It is designed to help \ninvestors understand underlying market trends to improve the quality of \ninvestment decisions, but is not necessary to execute a trade. The \nExchange believes that this does not impose any burden on intramarket \ncompetition as the benefit is given to any purchasers who meet the \nminimum purchase amount.\n    The proposed rule changes are grounded in the Exchange's efforts to \ncompete more effectively. In this competitive environment, potential \npurchasers are free to choose which, if any, similar product to \npurchase to satisfy their need for market information. As a result, the \nExchange believes this proposed rule change permits fair competition \namong national securities exchanges. Further, the Exchange believes \nthat these changes will not cause any unnecessary or inappropriate \nburden on intermarket competition, as the proposed incentive program \napplies uniformly to any purchaser of historical Open-Close Data.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\16\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\17\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission will institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or \ndisapproved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).\n    \\17\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to enhance the content of the NYSE Texas \nIntegrated Feed market data product offering. The proposed rule change \nis available on the Exchange's website at <a href=\"http://www.nyse.com\">www.nyse.com</a>, at the \nprincipal office of\n\n[[Page 21976]]\n\nthe Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization \nincluded statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the \nproposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the \nproposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at \nthe places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared \nsummaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most \nsignificant parts of such statements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to enhance the content of the NYSE Texas \nIntegrated Feed market data product offering.\n    NYSE Texas Integrated Feed is a NYSE Texas-only market data feed \nthat provides vendors and subscribers on a real-time basis with a \nunified view of events, in sequence, as they appear on the NYSE Texas \nmatching engine. The NYSE Texas Integrated Feed includes both top of \nbook and depth of book order data, last sale data, and security status \nupdates (e.g., trade corrections and trading halts) and stock summary \nmessages. The stock summary message is updated every minute and \nincludes the Exchange's aggregation of NYSE Texas's opening price, high \nprice, low price, closing price, and the cumulative volume for a \nsecurity, which information is available to vendors and subscribers to \ncalculate on their own should they so choose.\\4\\ The NYSE Texas \nIntegrated Feed includes information available to vendors and \nsubscribers of both NYSE Texas BBO and NYSE Texas Trades.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 87389 (October 23, \n2019), 84 FR 57904 (October 29, 2019) (SR-NYSECHX-2019-15) (Notice \nof Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change To \nEstablish the NYSE Chicago BBO, NYSE Chicago Trades and NYSE Chicago \nIntegrated Feed Market Data Feeds). On March 28, 2025, NYSE Chicago, \nInc. equities market became NYSE Texas, Inc. Pursuant to the \nformation of NYSE Texas, Inc., NYSE Chicago BBO, NYSE Chicago Trades \nand NYSE Chicago Integrated Feed are now known as NYSE Texas BBO, \nNYSE Texas Trades and NYSE Texas Integrated Feed, respectively. See \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No.102507 (February 28, 2025), 90 FR \n11445 (March 6, 2025) (SR-NYSECHX-2025-01) (Notice of Filing and \nImmediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Repeal the \nExchange's Certificate of Incorporation; Adopt the Certificate of \nFormation of NYSE Texas, Inc.; Amend the Exchange's By-Laws, Rules, \nand Certain Fee Schedules; and Amend the Certificate of \nIncorporation and By-Laws of the Exchange's Holding Company To \nReflect the Conversion of the Exchange to a Texas Corporation and \nthe Renaming of NYSE Chicago Holdings, Inc.).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to include Auction Imbalance Information in \nthe NYSE Texas Integrated Feed product in connection with the \nintroduction of auctions on NYSE Texas.\\5\\ In addition to the data \nelements described above, the NYSE Texas Integrated Feed would also \ninclude real-time order imbalances that accumulate prior to the opening \nof trading on the Exchange, prior to any re-opening auction after a \nhalt, and prior to the close of trading on the Exchange.\\6\\ As \nproposed, an enhanced NYSE Texas Integrated Feed would contain \naggregate information about orders that are subject to execution at the \nmarket's opening or closing price, as the case may be, and would \nrepresent issues that are likely to be of particular trading interest \nat the opening or closing. The NYSE Texas Integrated Feed market data \nproduct would provide Auction Imbalance Information with respect to all \nsymbols listed on the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See SR-NYSETEX-2025-08 (Proposed Rule Change to Adopt Rule \n7.35 Regarding Auctions). NYSE Texas Rule 7.35(a)(4) defines Auction \nImbalance Information as the information disseminated by the \nExchange for an auction. As set forth in NYSE Texas Rule 7.35, \nAuction Imbalance information includes, if applicable, the Total \nImbalance, Market Imbalance, Indicative Match Price and Matched \nVolume, each as defined in NYSE Texas Rule 7.35(a).\n    \\6\\ NYSE Texas order imbalance information is not currently \navailable through any of the Exchange's current data feeds as NYSE \nTexas does not currently provide for the operation of auctions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange will announce the date that an enhanced NYSE Texas \nIntegrated Feed will be available through a Trader Update.\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) \\7\\ of the \nAct, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) \\8\\ of \nthe Act, in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent \nand manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable \nprinciples of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with \npersons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, to remove \nimpediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and \na national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the \npublic interest, and it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination \namong customers, brokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\8\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange believes the proposal would facilitate transactions in \nsecurities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free \nand open market and a national market system by providing market \nparticipants an additional means to access information about order \nimbalance data disseminated by the Exchange. The proposal would improve \nthe content included in the NYSE Texas Integrated Feed and provide \ninvestors with an additional option for accessing information that may \nhelp to inform their trading decisions. The proposed inclusion of order \nimbalance data in the NYSE Texas Integrated Feed would also be \nconsistent with the data feeds offered by the Exchange's affiliates, \nNew York Stock Exchange, LLC (``NYSE''), NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE \nArca'') and NYSE American, LLC (``NYSE American''),\\9\\ and with a data \nfeed offered by the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''),\\10\\ all of \nwhich provide order imbalance information with respect to symbols \nlisted on each of those exchanges.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ See Securities Act Release Nos. 74128 (January 23, 2015), 80 \nFR 4951 (January 29, 2015) (SR-NYSE-2015-03) (Notice of Filing and \nImmediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change Establishing the \nNYSE Integrated Feed Data Feed); 74127 (January 23, 2015), 80 FR \n4956 (January 29, 2015) (SR-NYSEMKT-2015-06) (Notice of Filing and \nImmediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change Establishing the \nNYSE MKT Integrated Feed Data Feed); and 65669 (November 2, 2011), \n76 FR 69311 (November 8, 2011) (SR-NYSEArca-2011-78) (Notice of \nFiling and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change Offering \na Market Data Product to Vendors and Subscribers That Combines Three \nExisting Market Data Feeds as Well as Additional Market Data From \nthe Exchange Into One Integrated Product, the NYSE Arca Integrated \nData Feed).\n    \\10\\ See Nasdaq TotalView, <a href=\"https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/NTV\">https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/NTV</a> \n(displays the full order book depth for Nasdaq market participants \nand also disseminates the Net Order Imbalance Indicator (NOII) for \nthe Nasdaq Opening and Closing Crosses and Nasdaq IPO/Halt Cross).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory \norganizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to \noffer new and unique market data to consumers of such data. It was \nbelieved that this authority would expand the amount of data available \nto users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and \ncompetition for the provision of market data. The Exchange believes \nthat the data product modification proposed herein, the inclusion of \norder imbalance data, is precisely the sort of market data product \nenhancement that the Commission envisioned when it adopted Regulation \nNMS. The Commission concluded that Regulation NMS would itself further \nthe Act's goals of facilitating efficiency and competition:\n\n\n[[Page 21977]]\n\n\n    [E]fficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the \ndata beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the \nNBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to \nreceive (and pay for) such data. The Commission also believes that \nefficiency is promoted when broker-dealers may choose to receive \n(and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal \nanalysis of the need for such data.\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, \n2005), 70 FR 37496 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting \nRelease'').\n\n    By removing ``unnecessary regulatory restrictions'' on the ability \nof exchanges to sell their own data, Regulation NMS advanced the goals \nof the Act and the principles reflected in its legislative history.\n    The Exchange notes that the existence of alternatives to the \nExchange's product, including real-time consolidated data, free delayed \nconsolidated data, and proprietary data from other sources, ensures \nthat the Exchange is not unreasonably discriminatory because vendors \nand subscribers can elect these alternatives as their individual \nbusiness cases warrant.\n    Lastly, the proposal would not permit unfair discrimination because \nthe enhanced product would be available to all of the Exchange's \nvendors and subscribers on an equivalent basis at no cost as the \nExchange currently does not charge a fee for subscribing to the NYSE \nTexas Integrated Feed.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Rather, the proposal would \nenhance competition by enabling the Exchange to better compete with the \nExchange's affiliates, NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, and with \nNasdaq, all of which offer a similar product that includes order \nimbalance data for symbols listed on each of those exchanges.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See notes 9-10, supra.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The market for proprietary data products is currently competitive \nand inherently contestable because there is fierce competition for the \ninputs necessary to the creation of proprietary data. Numerous \nexchanges compete with each other for listings, trades, and market data \nitself, providing virtually limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs \nwho wish to produce and distribute their own market data. This \nproprietary data is produced by each individual exchange, as well as \nother entities (such as internalizing broker-dealers and various forms \nof alternative trading systems, including dark pools and electronic \ncommunication networks), in a vigorously competitive market. It is \ncommon for market participants to further and exploit this competition \nby sending their order flow and transaction reports to multiple \nmarkets, rather than providing them all to a single market.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the \nproposed rule change.\n\nD. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \\13\\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\\14\\ \nBecause the proposed rule change does not (i) significantly affect the \nprotection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any \nsignificant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative prior to \n30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as \nthe Commission may designate, if consistent with the protection of \ninvestors and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become \neffective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \\15\\ and Rule \n19b-4(f)(6)(iii) thereunder.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).\n    \\14\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).\n    \\15\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).\n    \\16\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \nrequires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission \nwritten notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along \nwith a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at \nleast five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed \nrule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. \nThe Exchange has fulfilled this requirement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \\17\\ normally \ndoes not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the \nfiling. However, pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii),\\18\\ the Commission \nmay designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the \nprotection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has \nrequested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so that \nthe proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The Exchange \nbelieves that waiver of the 30-day operative delay would allow the \nExchange to implement the proposed changes as soon as the technology \nassociated with the proposed changes is available, which is anticipated \nto be less than 30 days from the date of this filing.\\19\\ The \nCommission believes that waiver of the operative delay would be \nconsistent with the protection of investors and the public interest \nbecause this proposed rule change does not present any novel issues and \nit would provide investors with an additional option for accessing \npotentially helpful information that could inform their trading \ndecisions as soon as the technology related to the enhancement of the \nNYSE Texas Integrated Feed is implemented. Accordingly, the Commission \nhereby waives the 30-day operative delay and designates the proposed \nrule change as operative upon filing.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).\n    \\18\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).\n    \\19\\ See note 6, supra.\n    \\20\\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, \nthe Commission also has considered the proposed rule's impact on \nefficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. \n78c(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule \nchange, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.\n\nIV.

The text of the proposed rule change is provided in \nExhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/\">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at \nthe Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule relating to \nphysical connectivity fees.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange initially filed the proposed fee changes on \nJuly 3, 2023 (SR-CboeEDGX-2023-044). On September 1, 2023, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2023-057. On \nSeptember 29, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a \nSuspension of and Order Instituting Proceedings to Determine whether \nto Approve or Disapprove a Proposed Rule Change to Amend its Fees \nSchedule Related to Physical Port Fees (the ``OIP'') in anticipation \nof a possible U.S. government shutdown. On September 29, 2023, the \nExchange filed the proposed fee change (SR-CboeEDGX-2023-62). On \nOctober 13, 2023, the Exchange withdrew that filing and on business \ndate October 16, 2023 submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2023-065. On December \n12, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-\n2023-079. On December 20, the Exchange withdrew that filing and \nsubmitted SR-CboeEDGX-2023-081. On February 12, 2024, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-013. On April 9, \n2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-\n2024-020. On June 7, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and \nsubmitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-035. On August 29, 2024, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-056. On October \n25, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-\nCboeEDGX-2024-071. On December 18, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that \nfiling and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2024-085. On February 14, 2025, the \nExchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2025-011. On \nMarch 13, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-\nCboeEDGX-2025-022. On May 9, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing \nand submitted SR-CboeEDGX-2025-039. On May 15, 2025, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    By way of background, a physical port is utilized by a Member or \nnon-Member to connect to the Exchange at the data centers where the \nExchange's servers are located. The Exchange currently assesses the \nfollowing physical connectivity fees for Members and non-Members on a \nmonthly basis: $2,500 per physical port for a 1 gigabit (``Gb'') \ncircuit and $7,500 per physical port for a 10 Gb circuit. The Exchange \nproposes to increase the monthly fee for 10 Gb physical ports from \n$7,500 to $8,500 per port. The Exchange notes the proposed fee change \nbetter enables it to continue to maintain and improve its market \ntechnology and services and also notes that the proposed fee amount, \neven as amended, continues to be in line with, or even lower than, \namounts assessed by other exchanges for similar connections.\\4\\ The \nExchange also notes that a single 10 Gb physical port can be used to \naccess the Systems of the following affiliate exchanges: the Cboe BYX \nExchange, Inc., Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (options and equities \nplatforms), Cboe EDGA Exchange, Inc., and Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc., \n(``Affiliate Exchanges'').\\5\\ Notably, only one monthly fee currently \n(and will continue) to apply per 10 Gb physical port regardless of how \nmany affiliated exchanges are accessed through that one port.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ See e.g., The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), General \n8, Connectivity to the Exchange. Nasdaq and its affiliated exchanges \ncharge a monthly fee of $16,500 for each 10Gb Ultra fiber connection \nto the respective exchange. See also New York Stock Exchange LLC, \nNYSE American LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc., NYSE Chicago Inc., NYSE \nNational, Inc. Connectivity Fee Schedule, which provides that 10 Gb \nLX LCN Circuits (which are analogous to the Exchange's 10 Gb \nphysical port) are assessed $22,000 per month, per port.\n    \\5\\ The Affiliate Exchanges are also submitting contemporaneous \nidentical rule filings.\n    \\6\\ The Exchange notes that conversely, other exchange groups \ncharge separate port fees for access to separate, but affiliated, \nexchanges. See e.g., Securities and Exchange Release No. 99822 \n(March 21, 2024), 89 FR 21337 (March 27, 2024) (SR-MIAX-2024-016).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 21979]]\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\7\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\8\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\9\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule \nchange is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) \\10\\ of the Act, which \nrequires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of \nreasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other \npersons using its facilities. This belief is based on various factors \nas described below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\8\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\9\\ Id.\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    First, the Exchange believes its proposal is reasonable as it \nreflects a moderate increase in physical connectivity fees for 10 Gb \nphysical ports and its offering, even as amended, continues to be more \naffordable as compared to analogous physical connectivity offerings at \ncompetitor exchanges. For example, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC \n(``Nasdaq'') and its affiliated exchanges charge a monthly fee of \n$16,500 for each 10Gbps Ultra fiber connection and $11,000 per month \nfor each 10 Gbps fiber connection to their respective exchange.\\11\\ The \nExchange's proposed fee of $8,500 per physical port is lower than both \nof these offerings.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), General 8, \nConnectivity to the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Yet another example of higher fees charged by a competitor exchange \nis the 10Gpbs LX LCN Circuits offered by the New York Stock Exchange \nLLC and its affiliates (collectively, ``NYSE''). NYSE charges a fee of \n$22,000 per month,\\12\\ per port in contrast to the Exchange's proposed \nmonthly fee of $8,500 per month, per port. Despite the Exchange \nproposing to increase its fee for its 10 Gb physical port, it still \ncomes in at a cost significantly lower than its competitors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See New York Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE American LLC, NYSE \nArca, Inc., NYSE Chicago Inc., NYSE National, Inc. Connectivity Fee \nSchedule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Lastly, the Exchange also points towards the equivalent offering \nfrom MIAX Pearl which is $8,000 per port per month for its 10 Gigabit \nULL connection.\\13\\ However, the Exchange reiterates that a single \nphysical port offered by the Exchange offers the ability to connect to \nthe Affiliated Exchanges (equities and options) and the monthly price \ndoes not change based on the number of exchanges a participant is \nconnected to. In this case, examining only the Exchange's affiliated \nequities exchanges, a participant could purchase a single physical port \nfrom the Exchange and access roughly 11% of the U.S. Equities Market, \nin contrast to purchasing a single port from MIAX Pearl and accessing \nonly around 1% of the U.S. Equities Market.\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule.\n    \\14\\ See Cboe U.S. Equities Market Volume Summary (May 5, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes the current fee does not properly \nreflect the quality of the service and product, as fees for 10 Gb \nphysical ports have been static in nominal terms since 2018, and \ntherefore falling in real terms due to inflation. As a general matter, \nthe Producer Price Index (``PPI'') is a family of indexes that measures \nthe average change over time in selling prices received by domestic \nproducers of goods and services. PPI measures price change from the \nperspective of the seller. This contrasts with other metrics, such as \nthe Consumer Price Index (CPI), that measure price change from the \npurchaser's perspective.\\15\\ About 10,000 PPIs for individual products \nand groups of products are tracked and released each month.\\16\\ PPIs \nare available for the output of nearly all industries in the goods-\nproducing sectors of the U.S. economy--mining, manufacturing, \nagriculture, fishing, and forestry--as well as natural gas, \nelectricity, and construction, among others. The PPI program covers \napproximately 69 percent of the service sector's output, as measured by \nrevenue reported in the 2017 Economic Census.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>.\n    \\16\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For purposes of this proposal, the relevant industry-specific PPI \nis the Data Processing, hosting and related services (``Data PPI'') and \nmore particularly the more granular service line Data Processing, \nHosting and Related Services: Hosting, Active Server Pages (ASP), and \nOther Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure Provisioning \nServices.\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Provisioning is the process of preparing, assigning, and \nactivating IT infrastructure components, such as servers, storage, \nand network connectivity, according to user requirements. It is a \ncritical part of IT operations, as it ensures that computing \nresources are available when needed and that they are set up and \nconnected to work correctly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Data PPI was introduced in January 2002 by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics (``BLS'') as part of an ongoing effort to expand Producer \nPrice Index coverage of the services sector of the U.S. economy and is \nidentified as NAICS-518210 in the North American Industry \nClassification System (``NAICS'').\\18\\ According to the BLS ``[t]he \nprimary output of NAICS 518210 is the provision of electronic data \nprocessing services. In the broadest sense, computer services companies \nhelp their customers efficiently use technology. The processing \nservices market consists of vendors who use their own computer \nsystems--often utilizing proprietary software--to process customers' \ntransactions and data. Price movements for the NAICS 518210 index are \nbased on changes in the revenue received by companies that provide data \nprocessing services and price movements for the service line NAICS \n518210 index are based on changes in the revenue received by companies \nthat provide, among other things, IT infrastructure provisioning \nservices. Each month, companies provide net transaction prices for a \nspecified service. The transaction is an actual contract selected by \nprobability, where the price-determining characteristics are held \nconstant while the service is repriced. The prices used in index \ncalculation are the actual\n\n[[Page 21980]]\n\nprices billed for the selected service contract.'' \\19\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>. Among the \nindustry-specific PPIs is for North American Industry Classification \nSystem (``NAICS'') Code 518210: ``Data Processing and Related \nServices,'' NAICS index codes categorize products and services that \nare common to particular industries. According to BLS, these codes \n``provide comparability with a wide assortment of industry-based \ndata for other economic programs, including productivity, \nproduction, employment, wages, and earnings.''\n    \\19\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-services-industry-naics-518210.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-services-industry-naics-518210.htm</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The service (product) lines for which price indexes are available \nunder the Data PPI are: (1) business process management services (2) \ndata management and storage information transformation and other \nservices and (3) hosting ASP and other IT infrastructure provisioning \nservices. The most apt of these industry and product specific \ncategorizations for purposes of this present proposal to modify fees \nfor the 10 Gb physical port fee measures inflation for the provision of \ndata processing, hosting and related services as well as other \ninformation technology infrastructure provisioning services which BLS \nidentifies as identified as NAICS-5182105.\\20\\ The Exchange believes \nthat this measure of inflation is particularly appropriate because the \nExchange's connectivity services involve hosting and providing \nconnections to its customers' telecommunications and information \ntechnology equipment, as well as preparing, assigning, and activating \nIT infrastructure components, such as servers, storage, and network \nconnectivity. The Exchange also uses its ``proprietary software,'' \ni.e., its own proprietary matching engine software, to receive orders \non the Exchange's proprietary trading platform as well as to collect, \norganize, store and report customers' transactions. In other words, the \nExchange is in the business of data processing, hosting, ASP, and \nproviding other IT infrastructure provisioning services. Specifically, \nwithin this category, the Exchange points to the financial business \nprocess management services category under the umbrella of data \nprocessing.\\21\\ The financial business process management services is \ndescribed as ``providing a bundled service package that combines \ninformation-technology-intensive services with labor (manual or \nprofessional depending on the solution), machinery, and facilities to \nsupport, host and manage a financial business process for a client, \nsuch as financial transaction processing, credit card processing, \npayment services, and lending services.'' \\22\\ The Exchange's \nconnectivity service provides connections to its customers' \ntelecommunications and information technology equipment, as well as \npreparing, assigning, and activating IT infrastructure components to \nfacilitate the transmission of orders and receipt of financial \ntransactions for its customers while connected to the Exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ See <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105\">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105</a>.\n    \\21\\ See <a href=\"https://voorburggroup.org/Documents/2018%20Rome/Papers/1014.pdf\">https://voorburggroup.org/Documents/2018%20Rome/Papers/1014.pdf</a>.\n    \\22\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, the Exchange believes that this specific index is best \nsuited to guide this price increase as it reflects the change in this \nspecific instance over the last seven years instead of looking at the \nunderlying components of the service. PPI has published broad guidance \nregarding price adjustments for contracts,\\23\\ and within this it noted \nthat contracting parties should choose an index or group of indexes \nthat represent the cost for providing a particular product or service, \nrather than an index for the product itself.\\24\\ While this helps a \ncontracting seller avoid a circumstance where it is unable to raise its \nprice for the product itself if the underlying components have \nincreased and the PPI for the product itself has not yet increased--\nthis is not the case here. The Exchange instead is using historical \ndata over a seven-year period as a reference point for its proposed \nincrease moving forward--underlying components that have increased over \nthe course of seven years have since (by and large) been reflected in \nthe product itself.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ See <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting-parties.htm#FOOT5\">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting-parties.htm#FOOT5</a>.\n    \\24\\ ``For example, if an apparel manufacturer were contracting \nfor long-term purchases with a producer of finished fabrics, it \nwould be more advisable to tie the price adjustment clause to a PPI \nfor synthetic fibers, processed yarns and threads, or greige fabrics \n(raw fabric), rather than to a PPI for a type of finished fabric.'' \nId.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange further believes the Data PPI is an appropriate \nmeasure for purposes of the proposed rule change on the basis that it \nis a stable metric with limited volatility, unlike other consumer-side \ninflation metrics. In fact, the Data PPI has not experienced a greater \nthan 2.16% increase for any one calendar year period since Data PPI was \nintroduced into the PPI in January 2002. For example, the average \ncalendar year change from January 2002 to December 2023 was .62%, with \na cumulative increase of 15.67% over this 21-year period. The Exchange \nbelieves the Data PPI is considerably less volatile than other \ninflation metrics such as CPI, which has had individual calendar-year \nincreases of more than 6.5%, and a cumulative increase of over 73% over \nthe same period.\\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ See <a href=\"https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/\">https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As noted above, the current 10 Gb physical port fee remained \nunchanged for almost seven years, particularly since June 2018.\\26\\ \nSince its last increase almost 7 years ago however, there has been \nnotable inflation, including under the industry- and product-specific \nPPI, which as described above is a tailored measure of inflation. \nParticularly, the Hosting, ASP and other IT Infrastructure Provisioning \nServices inflation measure had a starting value of 102.2 in June 2018 \n(the month the Exchange started assessing the current fee) and an \nending value of 118.502 in January 2025, representing a 16% \nincrease.\\27\\ This indicates that companies who are also in the hosting \nASP and other IT infrastructure provisioning services have generally \nincreased prices for a specified service covered under NAICS 5182105 by \nan average of 16% during this period.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\26\\ See Securities and Exchange Release No. 83450 (June 15, \n2018), 83 FR 28884 (June 21, 2018) (SR-CboeEDGX-2018-016).\n    \\27\\ See <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105\">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU5182105182105</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also believes that it is reasonable to increase its \nfees to compensate for inflation because, over time, inflation has \ndegraded the value of each dollar that the Exchange collects in fees, \nsuch that the real revenue collected today is considerably less than \nthat same revenue collected in 2018. The impact of this inflationary \neffect is also independent of any change in the Exchange's costs in \nproviding its goods and services. The Exchange therefore believes that \nit is reasonable for it to offset, in part, this erosion in the value \nof the revenues it collects. Additionally, the Exchange historically \ndoes not increase fees every year notwithstanding inflation.\\28\\ Other \nexchanges have also filed for increases in certain fees, based in part \non comparisons to inflation.\\29\\ Accordingly, based on the above-\ndescribed percentage change based on an industry- and product-specific \ninflationary measure, and in conjunction with the rationale further \ndescribed above and below, the Exchange believes the proposed fee \nincrease is reasonable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ As the Exchange historically does not increase fees every \nyear notwithstanding inflation, the Exchange believes that the more \nspecific index is appropriate to look at as it is reflective of the \ncumulative increase over the course of almost seven years. While the \nPPI has published guidance that a broader index may be more helpful \nto reference in a contract to avoid large swings on a shorter \nduration (and to which such a swing over a brief duration may \ntrigger additional obligations), the Exchange, in contrast, is \ninstead looking forward to adjust its price to reflect changes in \nthe industry over the past seven years. See supra note 20.\n    \\29\\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-100994 \n(September 10, 2024), 89 FR 75612 (September 16, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-\n2024-79).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Next, the Exchange believes significant investments into, and\n\n[[Page 21981]]\n\nenhanced performance of, the Exchange, in the years following the last \n10 Gb physical port fee increase support the reasonableness of the \nproposed fee increase. These investments enhanced the quality of its \nservices, as measured by, among other things, increased throughput and \nfaster processing speeds. Customers have therefore greatly benefitted \nfrom these investments, while the Exchange's ability to recoup its \ninvestments has been hampered.\n    For example, the Exchange and its affiliated exchanges recently \nlaunched a multi-year initiative to improve Cboe Exchange Platform \nperformance and capacity requirements to increase competitiveness, \nsupport growth and advance a consistent world class platform. The goal \nof the project, among other things, is to provide faster and more \nconsistent order handling and matching performance for options, while \nensuring quicker processing time and supporting increasing volumes and \ncapacity needs. For example, the Exchange recently performed switch \nhardware upgrades. Particularly, the Exchange replaced existing \ncustomer access switches with newer models, which the Exchange believes \nresulted in increased determinism. The recent switch upgrades also \nincreased the Exchange's capacity to accommodate more physical ports by \nnearly 50%. Network bandwidth was also increased nearly two-fold as a \nresult of the upgrades, which among other things, can lead to reduce \nmessage queuing. The Exchange also believes these newer models result \nin less natural variance in the processing of messages. The Exchange \nnotes that it incurred costs associated with purchasing and upgrading \nto these newer models, of which the Exchange has not otherwise passed \nthrough or offset.\n    As of April 1, 2024, market participants also having the option of \nconnecting to a new data center (i.e., Secaucus NY6 Data Center \n(``NY6'')), in addition to the current data centers at NY4 and NY5. The \nExchange made NY6 available in response to customer requests in \nconnection with their need for additional space and capacity. In order \nto make this space available, the Exchange expended significant \nresources to prepare this space, and will also incur ongoing costs with \nrespect to maintaining this offering, including costs related to power, \nspace, fiber, cabinets, panels, labor and maintenance of racks. The \nExchange also incurred a large cost with respect to ensuring NY6 would \nbe latency equalized, as it is for NY4 and NY5.\n    The Exchange also has made various other improvements since the \ncurrent physical port rates were adopted in 2018. For example, the \nExchange has updated its customer portal to provide more transparency \nwith respect to firms' respective connectivity subscriptions, enabling \nthem to better monitor, evaluate and adjust their connections based on \ntheir evolving business needs. The Exchange also performs proactive \naudits on a weekly basis to ensure that all customer cross connects \ncontinue to fall within allowable tolerances for Latency Equalized \nconnections. Accordingly, the Exchange expended, and will continue to \nexpend, resources to innovate and modernize technology so that it may \nbenefit its Members and continue to compete among other equities \nmarkets. The ability to continue to innovate with technology and offer \nnew products to market participants allows the Exchange to remain \ncompetitive in the equities space which currently has 16 equities \nmarkets and potential new entrants. If the Exchange were not able to \nassess incrementally higher fees for its connectivity, it would \neffectively impact how the Exchange manages its technology and hamper \nthe Exchange's ability to continue to invest in and fund access \nservices in a manner that allows it to meet existing and anticipated \naccess demands of market participants. Disapproval of fee changes such \nas the proposal herein, could also have the adverse effect of \ndiscouraging an exchange from improving its operations and implementing \ninnovative technology to the benefit of market participants if it \nbelieves the Commission would later prevent that exchange from \nrecouping costs and monetizing its operational enhancements, thus \nadversely impacting competition as well as the interests of market \nparticipants and investors.\n    Finally, the proposed fee is also the same as is concurrently being \nproposed for its Affiliate Exchanges. Further, Members are able to \nutilize a single port to connect to all of its Affiliate Exchanges and \nwill only be charged one single fee (i.e., a market participant will \nonly be assessed the proposed $8,500 even if it uses that physical port \nto connect to the Exchange and another (or even all 6) of its Affiliate \nExchanges. Particularly, the Exchange believes the proposed monthly per \nport fee is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly discriminatory since \nas the Exchange has determined to not charge multiple fees for the same \nport. Indeed, the Exchange notes that several ports are in fact \npurchased and utilized across one or more of the Exchange's affiliated \nExchanges (and charged only once).\n    The Exchange also believes that the proposed fee change is not \nunfairly discriminatory because it would be assessed uniformly across \nall market participants that purchase the physical ports. The Exchange \nbelieves increasing the fee for 10 Gb physical ports and charging a \nhigher fee as compared to the 1 Gb physical port is equitable as the 1 \nGb physical port is \\1/10\\th the size of the 10 Gb physical port and \ntherefore does not offer access to many of the products and services \noffered by the Exchange (e.g., ability to receive certain market data \nproducts). Thus, the value of the 1 Gb alternative is lower than the \nvalue of the 10 Gb alternative, when measured based on the type of \nExchange access it offers. Moreover, market participants that purchase \n10 Gb physical ports utilize the most bandwidth and therefore consume \nthe most resources from the network. The Exchange also anticipates that \nfirms that utilize 10 Gb ports will benefit the most from the \nExchange's investment in offering NY6 as the Exchange anticipates there \nwill be much higher quantities of 10 Gb physical ports connecting from \nNY6 as compared to 1 Gb ports. Indeed, the Exchange notes that 10 Gb \nphysical ports account for approximately 90% of physical ports across \nthe NY4, NY5, and NY6 data centers, and to date, 80% of new port \nconnections in NY6 are 10 Gb ports. As such, the Exchange believes the \nproposed fee change for 10 Gb physical ports is reasonably and \nappropriately allocated.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed fee change will \nnot impact intramarket competition because it will apply to all \nsimilarly situated Members equally (i.e., all market participants that \nchoose to purchase the 10 Gb physical port). Additionally, the Exchange \ndoes not believe its proposed pricing will impose a barrier to entry to \nsmaller participants and notes that its proposed connectivity pricing \nis associated with relative usage of the various market participants. \nFor example, market participants with modest capacity needs can \ncontinue to buy the less expensive 1 Gb physical port (which cost is \nnot changing) or may choose to obtain access via a third-party re-\nseller. While pricing may be increased for the larger capacity physical \nports, such options provide far more capacity and are\n\n[[Page 21982]]\n\npurchased by those that consume more resources from the network. \nAccordingly, the proposed connectivity fees do not favor certain \ncategories of market participants in a manner that would impose a \nburden on competition; rather, the allocation reflects the network \nresources consumed by the various size of market participants--lowest \nbandwidth consuming members pay the least, and highest bandwidth \nconsuming members pays the most.\n    The proposed fee change also does not impose a burden on \ncompetition or on other Self-Regulatory Organizations that is not \nnecessary or appropriate. As described above, the Exchange evaluated \nits proposed fee change using objective and stable metric with limited \nvolatility. Utilizing Data Processing PPI over a specified period of \ntime is a reasonable means of recouping a portion of the Exchange's \ninvestment in maintaining and enhancing the connectivity service \nidentified above. The Exchange believes utilizing Data Processing PPI, \na tailored measure of inflation, to increase certain connectivity fees \nto recoup the Exchange's investment in maintaining and enhancing its \nservices and products would not impose a burden on competition.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\30\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\31\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

(This is not a toll-free \nnumber.)\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 38 U.S.C. 2102(e), 38 \nU.S.C. 2102A(b)(2), 38 U.S.C. 2102B(b)(2), and 38 CFR 36.4411, the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs announces for FY 2025 the aggregate \namounts of assistance available to Veterans and Service members \neligible for SAH program grants.\n    Section 2102(e)(2) authorizes the Secretary to increase the \naggregate amounts of SAH assistance annually based on a residential \nhome cost-of construction index. The Secretary uses the Turner Building \nCost Index for this purpose (see 38 CFR 36.4411(a)). Such increase will \nbe equal to the percentage by which the Turner Building Cost Index for \nthe most recent calendar year (CY) exceeds that of the next preceding \nCY. If, however, the Turner Building Cost Index for the most recent \nfull CY is equal to or less than the next preceding CY, the percentage \nincrease will be zero (see 38 CFR 36.4411(b)).\n    In the most recent quarter for which the Turner Building Cost Index \nis available, second quarter 2024, the index showed an increase of \n4.10% over the index value listed for second quarter 2023. Turner \nConstruction Company, <a href=\"https://www.turnerconstruction.com/cost-index\">https://www.turnerconstruction.com/cost-index</a> \n(last visited August 1, 2024). Pursuant to 38 CFR 36.4411(a), \ntherefore, the aggregate amounts of assistance for SAH grants made \npursuant to 38 U.S.C. 2101(a) and 2101(b) have increased by 4.10% for \nFY 2025. This CY period, second quarter to second quarter, provides \nmore up-to-date cost of construction information for a possible \nadjustment effective October 1 when compared to a January-through-\nDecember period, which would result in a 10-month delay in \nimplementation.\n    Sections 2102A(b)(2) and 2102B(b)(2) require the Secretary to apply \nthe same percentage calculated pursuant to section 2102(e) to grants \nauthorized pursuant to sections 2102A and 2102B. As such, the maximum \namount of assistance available under these grants has also increased by \n4.10% for FY 2025.\n    The increases were effective as of October 1, 2024. 38 U.S.C. \n2102(e), 38 U.S.C. 2102A(b)(2), and 38 U.S.C. 2102B(b)(2).\n\nSAH: Aggregate Amounts of Assistance Available During FY 2025\n\nSection 2101(a) Grants and Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) Grants\n\n    Effective October 1, 2024, the aggregate amount of assistance \navailable for SAH grants made pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 2101(a) is $121,812 \nduring FY 2025.\n    The maximum TRA grant made to an individual who satisfies the \neligibility criteria under 38 U.S.C. 2101(a) and 2102A is $49,062 \nduring FY 2025.\n\nSection 2101(b) Grants and TRA Grants\n\n    Effective as of October 1, 2024, the aggregate amount of assistance \navailable for SAH grants made pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 2101(b) is $24,405 \nduring FY 2024.\n    The maximum TRA grant made to an individual who satisfies the \neligibility criteria under 38 U.S.C. 2101(b) and 2102A is $8,760 during \nFY 2025.\n\nSection 2102B Grants\n\n    Effective as of October 1, 2024, the amount of assistance available \nfor grants made pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 2102B is $111,759 during FY 2025, \nhowever the Secretary may waive this limitation for a Veteran if the \nSecretary determines a waiver is necessary for the rehabilitation \nprogram of the Veteran.\n\nSigning Authority\n\n    Douglas A.
