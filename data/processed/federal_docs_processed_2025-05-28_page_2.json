The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments \non the proposed rule change from interested persons.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange is filing a proposal to amend the MIAX Sapphire \nOptions Exchange Fee Schedule (the ``Fee Schedule'') to adopt new fee \ncategories for the Exchange's proprietary market data feeds: (i) MIAX \nSapphire Top of Market (``ToM'') data feed; (ii) MIAX Sapphire Complex \nTop of Market (``cToM'') data feed; and (iii) MIAX Sapphire Liquidity \nFeed (``SLF'') (collectively, the ``market data feeds'').\n    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's \nwebsite at <a href=\"https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule-filings\">https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX Sapphire's principal office, and at the \nCommission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange offers three standard proprietary market data \nproducts, ToM, cToM, and SLF. The ToM data feed is a data feed that \ncontains the Exchange's best bid and offer, with aggregate size, and \nlast sale information, based on order and quoting interest on the \nExchange.\\3\\ The ToM data feed includes data that is identical to the \ndata sent to the processor for the Options Price Reporting Authority \n(``OPRA''). The data for ToM and OPRA leave the System \\4\\ at the same \ntime, as required under Section 5.2(c)(iii)(B) of the Limited Liability \nCompany Agreement of the Options Price Reporting Authority LLC (the \n``OPRA Plan''), which prohibits the dissemination of proprietary \ninformation on any more timely basis than the same information is \nfurnished to the OPRA system for inclusion in OPRA's consolidated \ndissemination of options information. The cToM data feed includes the \nsame types of information as ToM, but for Complex Orders \\5\\ on the \nExchange's Strategy Book.\\6\\ This information includes the Exchange's \nbest bid and offer for a complex strategy,\\7\\ with aggregate size, \nbased on displayable orders in the complex strategy. The cToM data feed \nalso provides subscribers with the following information: (i) the \nidentification of the complex strategies currently trading on the \nExchange; (ii) complex strategy last sale information; and (iii) the \nstatus of securities underlying the complex strategy (e.g., halted, \nopen, or resumed). The SLF data feed provides market participants with \na direct data feed that allows subscribers to receive real-time updates \nof options orders, products traded on MIAX Sapphire, MIAX Sapphire \nSystem status, and MIAX Sapphire underlying trading status.\\8\\ When an \norder is received or an order state changes, published order \ninformation will be transmitted over SLF, including time stamp, action, \nproduct ID, order ID, order side, order type, order price, original \norder size, open order size, time in force, origin, open or close, and \nroute instruction. For complex orders, complex strategy definition \nnotification and complex order notice are also included. Subscribers to \nthe SLF will get a list of all options symbols and strategies that will \nbe traded and sourced on that feed at the start of every session.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100588 (July 25, \n2024), 89 FR 61554 (July 31, 2024) (SR-SAPPHIRE-2024-01).\n    \\4\\ The term ``System'' means the automated trading system used \nby the Exchange for the trading of securities. See Exchange Rule \n100.\n    \\5\\ In sum, a ``Complex Order'' is ``any order involving the \nconcurrent purchase and/or sale of two or more different options in \nthe same underlying security (the `legs' or `components' of the \ncomplex order), for the same account . . . .'' See Exchange Rule \n518(a)(5).\n    \\6\\ The ``Strategy Book'' is the Exchange's electronic book of \ncomplex orders and complex quotes. See Exchange Rule 518(a)(19).\n    \\7\\ The term ``complex strategy'' means a particular combination \nof components and their ratios to one another. New complex \nstrategies can be created as the result of the receipt of a complex \norder or by the Exchange for a complex strategy that is not \ncurrently in the System. The Exchange may limit the number of new \ncomplex strategies that may be in the System at a particular time \nand will communicate this limitation to Members via Regulatory \nCircular. See Exchange Rule 518(a)(6).\n    \\8\\ The Exchange established the Definitions section of the Fee \nSchedule in a separate rule filing. See Securities Exchange Act \nRelease No. 100683 (August 9, 2024), 89 FR 66467 (August 15, 2024) \n(SR-SAPPHIRE-2024-13).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 6 of the Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees, provides fees for \nthe ToM,\n\n[[Page 22416]]\n\ncToM, and SLF data feeds. The Exchange waived such fees during an \nInitial Waiver Period,\\9\\ which expired on March 1, 2025.\\10\\ At the \nexpiration of the Initial Waiver Period, the Exchange began to charge \nmonthly fees to both Internal and External Distributors (proposed \ndefinitions below) of the ToM, cToM, and SLF data feeds. Specifically, \nthe Exchange started to charge Internal Distributors a monthly fee of \n$1,200.00 for the ToM and cToM data feeds, and $3,000.00 for the SLF \ndata feed. The Exchange also started to charge External Distributors a \nmonthly fee of $2,000.00 for the ToM and cToM data feeds, and $3,500.00 \nfor the SLF data feed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ The term ``Initial Waiver Period'' means, for each \napplicable fee, the period of time from the initial effective date \nof the MIAX Sapphire Fee Schedule plus an additional six (6) full \ncalendar months after the completion of the partial month of the \nExchange launch. See the Definitions section of the Fee Schedule.\n    \\10\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102321 (February 3, \n2025), 90 FR 9173 (February 7, 2025) (SR-SAPPHIRE-2025-04).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange now proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to, among other \nthings, adopt new fee categories for the Exchange's proprietary market \ndata feeds. The primary purpose of this proposal is to adopt per User \n(defined below) fees as well as fees for Non-Display Usage (also \ndefined below). The Exchange also proposes to add a ``Market Data \nDefinitions'' section to Section 6 of the Fee Schedule as well as \nmodify how mid-month subscriptions for Distributors are to be handled. \nThe Exchange believes that adopting the same fee structure as its \naffiliated exchanges would reduce administrative burdens on market data \nsubscribers that also currently subscribe to market data feeds from the \nExchange's affiliates. Each of these proposed changes are described \nbelow.\n* * * * *\n    The Exchange believes that exchanges, in setting fees of all types, \nshould meet very high standards of transparency to demonstrate why each \nnew fee or fee increase meets the requirements of the Act that fees be \nreasonable, equitably allocated, not unfairly discriminatory, and not \ncreate an undue burden on competition among Members \\11\\ and markets. \nThe Exchange believes this high standard is especially important when \nan exchange imposes various fees for market participants to access an \nexchange's market data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization \napproved to exercise the trading rights associated with a Trading \nPermit. Members are deemed ``members'' under the Exchange Act. See \nExchange Rule 100.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Approximately 60% of Members subscribe to one or more market data \nfeeds from the Exchange. Of those Members, approximately 37% subscribe \nto all four market data feeds, approximately 22% subscribe to three \nmarket data feeds, approximately 19% subscribe to two market data \nfeeds, and approximately 22% subscribe to only one market data feed. \nThe Exchange notes that there is no requirement that any Member or \nmarket participant subscribe to the ToM, cToM, or SLF data feeds \noffered by the Exchange. Instead, a Member may choose to maintain \nsubscriptions to the ToM, cToM, or SLF data feeds based on their own \nbusiness needs and trading models.\nDefinitions\n    The Exchange proposes to include a Definitions section at the \nbeginning of Section 6, Market Data Fees, of the Fee Schedule. The \npurpose of the Definitions section is to provide market participants \ngreater clarity and transparency regarding the applicability of fees by \ndefining certain terms used in connection with market data feeds within \nthe Fee Schedule in a single location related to the Exchange's market \ndata products. The Exchange notes that it includes similar Definitions \nin its fee schedule applicable to its own equity trading platform, MIAX \nPearl Equities,\\12\\ and that each of the proposed definitions are based \non the MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule and that of other exchanges. \nThe Exchange believes that including a Definitions section for market \ndata products makes the Fee Schedule more user-friendly and \ncomprehensive.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Fees, and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 (June 12, \n2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25). See also Cboe \nBZX Exchange, Inc. (``Cboe BZX Options'') Fee Schedule, Market Data \nFees section, and Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (``Cboe EDGX Options'') \nFee Schedule, Market Data Fees section. See also MEMX LLC (``MEMX \nOptions'') Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section, and Securities \nExchange Act Release No. 101370 (October 17, 2024), 89 FR 84638 \n(October 23, 2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40) (``MEMX Options Market Data Fee \nProposal'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes to define the following terms in Section 6 of \nthe Fee Schedule:\n    <bullet> Distributor. Any entity that receives the Exchange data \nproduct directly from the Exchange or indirectly through another entity \nand then distributes it internally or externally to a third party.\n    <bullet> External Distributor. A Distributor that receives the \nExchange data product and then distributes that data to a third party \nor one or more Users outside the Distributor's own entity.\n    <bullet> Internal Distributor. A Distributor that receives the \nExchange data product and then distributes that data to one or more \nUsers within the Distributor's own entity.\n    [cir] The Exchange notes that it proposes to use the phrase ``own \nentity'' in the definition of Internal Distributor and External \nDistributor because a Distributor would be permitted to share data \nreceived from an exchange data product to other legal entities \naffiliated with the Distributor's entity that have been disclosed to \nthe Exchange without such distribution being considered external to a \nthird party. For instance, if a company has multiple affiliated broker-\ndealers under the same holding company, that company could have one of \nthe broker-dealers or a non-broker-dealer affiliate subscribe to an \nexchange data product and then share the data with other affiliates \nthat have a need for the data. This sharing with affiliates would not \nbe considered external distribution to a third party but instead would \nbe considered internal distribution to data recipients within the \nDistributor's own entity.\n    [cir] The Exchange also notes that the explanatory paragraphs under \nthe ToM, cToM, and SLF data feed fee tables includes the following \nlanguage which defines the terms Distributor, Internal Distributors, \nand External Distributors:\n\n    MIAX Sapphire will assess Market Data Fees applicable to ToM \n[cToM, AIS or SLF] on Internal and External Distributors in each \nmonth the Distributor is credentialed to use ToM [cToM, AIS or SLF] \nin the production environment. A Distributor of MIAX Sapphire data \nis any entity that receives a feed or file of data either directly \nfrom MIAX Sapphire or indirectly through another entity and then \ndistributes it either internally (within that entity) or externally \n(outside that entity). All Distributors are required to execute an \nExchange Distributor Agreement.\n\n    The Exchange proposes to remove these provisions from the Fee \nSchedule because they: (i) duplicate the proposed definitions of \nDistributor, External Distributor, and External Distributor proposed \nherein with no substantive difference; and (ii) provide details that \nare included in the Exchange's market data policies that are also not \nalso provided for in the fee schedules of other options exchanges.\\13\\ \nRemoving these provisions would also harmonize the definition and fee \ndescriptions with\n\n[[Page 22417]]\n\nthe fee schedule applicable to MIAX Pearl Equities.\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options, Market Data Fees section, both available at \n<a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/?_gl=1*19q7zz0*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjY5OTA0NzE4LjE3MzQ1MzQzODk.*_ga_5Q99WB9X71*MTczNDUzNzQ0Mi4yLjEuMTczNDUzNzQ5OC4wLjAuMA\">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/?_gl=1*19q7zz0*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjY5OTA0NzE4LjE3MzQ1MzQzODk.*_ga_5Q99WB9X71*MTczNDUzNzQ0Mi4yLjEuMTczNDUzNzQ5OC4wLjAuMA</a>.

Any method of accessing an Exchange \ndata product that involves access or use by a machine or automated \ndevice without access or use of a display by a natural person or \npersons.\n    <bullet> Non-Professional User. A natural person or qualifying \ntrust that uses Exchange data only for personal purposes and not for \nany commercial purpose and, for a natural person who works in the \nUnited States, is not: (i) registered or qualified in any capacity with \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading \nCommission, any state securities agency, any securities exchange or \nassociation, or any commodities or futures contract market or \nassociation; (ii) engaged as an ``investment adviser'' as that term is \ndefined in Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 \n(whether or not registered or qualified under that Act); or (iii) \nemployed by a bank or other organization exempt from registration under \nfederal or state securities laws to perform functions that would \nrequire registration or qualification if such functions were performed \nfor an organization not so exempt; or, for a natural person who works \noutside of the United States, does not perform the same functions as \nwould disqualify such person as a Non-Professional User if he or she \nworked in the United States.\n    <bullet> Professional User. Any User other than a Non-Professional \nUser.\n    <bullet> User. A Professional User or Non-Professional User.\nProposed Market Data Pricing\n    As described above, upon the expiration of the Initial Waiver \nPeriod, the Exchange began to charge Internal Distributors a monthly \nfee of $1,200.00 for the ToM and cToM data feeds, and $3,000.00 for the \nSLF data feed. The Exchange also only currently charges External \nDistributors a monthly fee of $2,000.00 for the ToM and cToM data \nfeeds, and $3,500.00 for the SLF data feed. The Exchange now proposes \nto charge the below per User fees as well as Non-Display Usage fees for \nthe ToM, cToM, and SLF data feeds, which, the Exchange believes are \ngenerally similar to or lower than market data fees charged by other \nsimilarly situated options exchanges. The Exchange does not propose to \nadopt any additional fee categories in this proposal. Each of the below \ncapitalized terms are defined above and would be included under the \nproposed Definitions section under Section 6, Market Data Fees, of the \nFee Schedule.\n    1. User Fees. For the ToM, cToM, and SLF data feeds, the Exchange \nproposes to charge a monthly fee of $20.00 for each Professional User \nand $1.00 for each Non-Professional User of each data feed.\\15\\ The \nproposed User fees would apply to each person that has access to the \nToM, cToM, or SLF data feeds that is provided by a Distributor (either \nInternal or External) for displayed usage. Each Distributor's User \ncount would include every individual that has access to the data \nregardless of the purpose for which the individual uses the data. The \nabove Professional or Non-Professional User fee would provide the same \nProfessional or Non-Professional User access to all other MIAX Sapphire \nMarket Data feeds for no additional per User charge.\\16\\ In other \nwords, a User would receive access to the ToM, cToM, and SLF data feeds \nfor the applicable single per User fee and not have to pay separate per \nUser fees for each data feed. As such, Distributors should report the \nnumber of Users per the Exchange, and not per individual data feed. \nThis would be noted in Section 6 of the Fee Schedule under footnote 1 \nfollowing the fee tables for the ToM, cToM, and SLF data feeds. \nDistributors of the ToM, cToM, or SLF data feeds would be required to \nreport all Professional and Non-Professional Users in accordance with \nthe following:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ The Exchange does not propose to adopt an Enterprise Fee at \nthis time and may do so in the future based on feedback from market \nparticipants.\n    \\16\\ The Exchange notes that similar reporting is required by \nthe Nasdaq options markets, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq \nOptions''), Nasdaq Phlx LLC (``Nasdaq Phlx''), and Nasdaq MRX, LLC \n(``Nasdaq MRX''). See, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions\">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions</a> (providing that ``[t]he monthly \nuser fee should be reported once for Nasdaq Options, not once per \ndatafeed'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> In connection with a Distributor's distribution of the \nToM, cToM, or SLF data feeds, the Distributor must count as one User \neach unique User that the Distributor is entitled for access to the \nToM, cToM, or SLF data feeds.\n    <bullet> Distributors must report each unique individual person who \nreceives access through multiple devices or multiple methods (e.g., a \nsingle User has multiple passwords and user identifications) as one \nUser.\n    <bullet> If a Distributor entitles one or more individuals to use \nthe same device, the Distributor must include only the individuals, and \nnot the device, in the count. Thus, Distributors would not be required \nto report User device counts associated with a User's display use of \nthe data feed.\n    2. Non-Display Usage Fees. The Exchange proposes to establish a \nmonthly Non-Display Usage \\17\\ fee of $1,500.00 for the ToM, cToM, and \nSLF data feeds.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Non-Display Usage would include trading uses such as high \nfrequency or algorithmic trading as well as any trading in any asset \nclass, automated order or quote generation and/or order pegging, \nprice referencing for smart order routing, operations control \nprograms, investment analysis, order verification, surveillance \nprograms, risk management, compliance, and portfolio management.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> The Exchange proposes to provide a discount to those that \nsubscribe to two or more MIAX Sapphire data feeds by capping the Non-\nDisplay Usage fee for Subscribers of two or more MIAX Sapphire data \nfeeds at $3,000.00. This would be noted in Section 6 of the Fee \nSchedule under footnote 2 following the fee tables for the ToM, cToM, \nand SLF data feeds.\n    Lastly, the Exchange proposes to no longer pro-rate fees for \nDistributors who subscribe or terminate mid-month. The Exchange notes \nthat there were no mid-month subscriptions or terminations over the \npast twelve (12) months that would have required the monthly fee to be \npro-rated. The Exchange also notes that mid-month subscriptions and \nterminations could place an increased burden on Exchange staff and \nsystems that are in place to pro-rate the monthly fee that are not \njustified by the little to no mid-month subscriptions and terminations \nthat occurred over the past year on its affiliated options exchanges or \nthat the Exchange anticipates going forward based on its past \nexperience. This portion of the proposal should also encourage \nsubscribers to either begin a new subscription or terminate an existing \nsubscription at the beginning or end of a month, respectively. Lastly, \nremoving these provisions would also harmonize the MIAX Sapphire Fee \nSchedule with the MIAX Pearl Equities fee schedule, which also does not \nprovide for pro-ration.\\18\\ Also, other exchanges do not provide for \nthe similar pro-ration of market data fees.\\19\\ Therefore, the Exchange \nproposes to remove the following language providing for pro-rated month \nfees for mid-month subscribers from the\n\n[[Page 22418]]\n\nexplanatory paragraphs under the ToM, cToM, and SLF data feed fee \ntables:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Fees, and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 (June 12, \n2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n    \\19\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule and Cboe EDGX Options Fee \nSchedule, supra note 13. See also MEMX Options Fee Schedule and \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 101370 (October 17, 2024), 89 FR \n84638 (October 23, 2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n\n    Market Data Fees for [ToM/cToM/SLF] will be reduced for new \nDistributors for the first month during which they subscribe to \n[ToM/cToM/SLF], based on the number of trading days that have been \nheld during the month prior to the date on which they have been \ncredentialed to use [ToM/cToM/SLF] in the production environment. \nSuch new Distributors will be assessed a pro-rata percentage of the \nfees described above, which is the percentage of the number of \ntrading days remaining in the affected calendar month as of the date \non which they have been credentialed to use [ToM/cToM/SLF] in the \nproduction environment, divided by the total number of trading days \nin the affected calendar month.\nRemove Initial Waiver Period Rule Text\n    The Exchange also proposes to remove the rule text regarding the \nInitial Waiver Period that is below the table of fees in Sections 6)a) \nand b) of the Fee Schedule. As noted above, the Exchange established \nthe Initial Waiver Period when it launched operations on August 13, \n2024 for a defined period of time. The Initial Waiver Period was in \neffect for the partial month in which the Fee Schedule was established \nin August 2024, continuing in effect for six months thereafter. \nAccordingly, the Initial Waiver Period automatically expired at the end \nof February 2025. The purpose of this change is to remove text that no \nlonger applies from the Fee Schedule, thereby providing clarity to \nmarket participants regarding the Exchange's market data fees.\nImplementation\n    The Exchange issued alerts publicly announcing the proposed fees on \nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 17, 2024.\\20\\ The fees subject to this \nproposal are immediately effective.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ See Fee Change Alert, MIAX Exchange Group--January 1, 2025 \nand March 1, 2025 Market Data Fee Changes (dated September 30, \n2024), available at <a href=\"https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/09/30/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2025-market-1?nav=all\">https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/09/30/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2025-market-1?nav=all</a> and Fee Change Alert, MIAX Exchange Group--Options \nMarkets--Reminder: January 1, 2025 and March 1, 2025 Market Data Fee \nChanges (dated December 17, 2024), available at <a href=\"https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/12/17/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-reminder-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2?nav=all\">https://www.miaxglobal.com/alert/2024/12/17/miax-exchange-group-options-markets-reminder-january-1-2025-and-march-1-2?nav=all</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent \nwith the provisions of Section 6(b) \\21\\ of the Act in general, and \nfurthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) \\22\\ of the Act, in \nparticular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable \nallocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its Members \nand other persons using its facilities. Additionally, the Exchange \nbelieves that the proposed fees are consistent with the objectives of \nSection 6(b)(5) \\23\\ of the Act in that they are designed to promote \njust and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and \ncoordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, \nprocessing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions \nin securities, to remove impediments to a free and open market and \nnational market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the \npublic interest, and, particularly, are not designed to permit unfair \ndiscrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f.\n    \\22\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).\n    \\23\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes that the ToM, cToM, and SLF data feeds are \nentirely optional. The Exchange is not required to make the ToM, cToM, \nand SLF data feeds available to any customers, nor is any customer \nrequired to purchase the ToM, cToM, and SLF data feeds.\nThe Proposed Fees Are Reasonable and Comparable to the Fees Charged by \nOther Exchanges for Similar Data Products\n    Overall. The proposed fees are comparable to those of other options \nexchanges. Based on publicly-available information, no single exchange \nhad more than 13.65% equity options market share for all of 2024,\\24\\ \nand the Exchange compared the fees proposed herein to the fees charged \nby other options exchanges with similar market share. A more detailed \ndiscussion of the comparison follows.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ See the Market Share section of the Exchange's website, \nU.S. Options, available at <a href=\"https://www.miaxglobal.com/company/data/market-share\">https://www.miaxglobal.com/company/data/market-share</a> (last visited May 7, 2025). Unlike its affiliate \noptions exchanges that utilized full year 2024 market share numbers \nfor their comparisons to other exchanges in their related market \ndata fee filings, the Exchange chose the most recent full month to \ncompare market share because the Exchange has not yet had a full \nyear of operations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange assesses the market share for each of the below \nreferenced options markets utilizing total equity options contracts \ntraded in April 2025, as set forth in the following charts: \\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ Market share is the percentage of volume on a particular \nexchange relative to the total volume across all exchanges, and \nindicates the amount of order flow directed to that exchange. High \nlevels of market share enhance the value of trading and ports. Total \ncontracts include both multi-list options and proprietary options \nproducts. Proprietary options products are products with \nintellectual property rights that are not multi-listed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Fees\n    The proposed per User fees for the Exchange's market data products \nare comparable to or lower than those charged by Nasdaq Options, Nasdaq \nMRX, Cboe BZX Options, and Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc.

Cboe BZX Options, with a market share of \napproximately 4.21%, which is lower than the Exchange's market share, \ncharges higher Professional and Non-Professional User fees for its \ndepth of book feed than the fees proposed by the Exchange. Further, \nCboe BZX Options also charges separate per User fees per data product, \nwhereas the Exchange proposes to charge a single lower per User fee \nthat would provide access to all of its market data products for a \nsingle fee.\n    The Cboe BZX Options Top feed is an options feed that provides top \nof book quotations and execution information.\\35\\ The Cboe BZX Options \nTop feed is similar to the Exchange's ToM feed. The Cboe BZX Options \nDepth feed is an options feed that provides depth of book quotations \nand execution information. The Cboe BZX Options Depth feed is similar \nto the Exchange's SLF data feed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\35\\ For the Cboe BZX Options Top feed, Cboe BZX Option charges \nProfessional Users $5.00 per month and Non-Professional Users $0.10 \nper month. For ToM, cToM and SLF data feeds, the Exchange proposes \nto charge Professional Users $20.00 per month and Non-Professional \nUsers $1.00 per month. Although higher, the Exchange's proposed \nProfessional and Non-Professional User fees are not necessarily \ncomparable to Cboe BZX Options Top fees because a User may receive \naccess to each of the Exchange's three data feeds for a single per \nUser fee and, unlike Cboe BZX Options, not be required to pay a \nseparate per User fee for each data product and Cboe BZX Options \nonly provides two data feeds that provide only Cboe BZX Options \ndata. Cboe BZX Options also offers the Cboe One Options Feed, which \nprovides information for not only Cboe BZX Options, but also its \nthree affiliated options markets, Cboe EDGX Options, Cboe, and Cboe \nC2. See Cboe BZX Options Rule 21.15(b)(6).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe BZX Options charges Professional Users $30.00 per month and \nNon-Professional Users $1.00 per month for the Cboe BZX Options Depth \nfeed. The Exchange proposes to charge less than Cboe BZX Options and \nprovide access to all of its market data fees for single, and still \nlower, per User fee. Specifically, for ToM, cToM, and SLF data feeds, \nthe Exchange proposes to charge Professional Users $20.00 per month and \nNon-Professional Users $1.00 per month. The Exchange's proposed \nProfessional User fee is lower than Cboe BZX Options and its Non-\nProfessional User fee is equal to Cboe BZX Options. However, both of \nthe Exchange's proposed fees can be lower than Cboe BZX Options because \na User may receive access to each of the Exchange's data feeds for a \nsingle per User fee and, unlike Cboe BZX Options, not be required to \npay a separate per User fee for each data product.\\36\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\36\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Cboe C2. Cboe C2, with a market share of approximately 2.89% that \nis lower than the Exchange, charges higher Professional and Non-\nProfessional User fees for its C2 Options Depth and C2 COB feed than \nproposed by the Exchange. Unlike Cboe C2, the Exchange proposes to \ncharge a single per User fee that would provide access to all of its \nmarket data products for a single fee.\n    The Cboe C2 Options Depth feed is an options feed that provides \ndepth of book quotations and execution information. The Cboe C2 Options \nDepth feed is similar to the Exchange's SLF data feed. The Cboe C2 COB \nfeed is an options data feed that provides information for complex \nstrategies (multi-leg trades, such as spreads, straddles and buy-\nwrites).\\37\\ The Cboe C2 COB feed is\n\n[[Page 22420]]\n\nsimilar to the Exchange's cToM data feed.\\38\\ Cboe C2 charges all \nUsers, both Professional Users and Non-Professional Users, $25.00 per \nmonth for the Cboe C2 COB feed and $50.00 for the Depth feed.\\39\\ The \nExchange proposes to charge less than Cboe C2 for Professional Users \nand Non-Professional Users while also providing access to all of its \nmarket data feeds for a single per User fee. Specifically, for the cToM \ndata feed, the Exchange proposes to charge Professional Users $20.00 \nper month and Non-Professional Users $1.00 per month. The Exchange's \nproposed Professional User and Non-Professional User fees are lower \nthan the fees for the Cboe C2 COB feed. Despite having slightly higher \nmarket share than the Exchange, Cboe C2 charges higher or comparable \nper User fees than proposed by the Exchange herein.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\37\\ See <a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/market_data_services/us/options/\">https://www.cboe.com/market_data_services/us/options/</a>.\n    \\38\\ Cboe C2 also provides the Cboe C2 Top feed, which provides \ntop of book quotations and execution information. Cboe C2 Top is \nsimilar to the Exchange's ToM feed. Cboe C2 charges Professional \nUsers $5.00 per month and Non-Professional Users $0.10 per month. \nFor ToM, cToM and SLF data feeds, the Exchange proposes to charge \nProfessional Users $20.00 per month and Non-Professional Users $1.00 \nper month. Although higher, the Exchange's proposed Professional and \nNon-Professional User fees are not necessarily comparable to Cboe C2 \nTop fees because a User may receive access to each of the Exchange's \nthree data feeds for a single per User fee and, unlike Cboe C2, not \nbe required to pay a separate per User fee for each data product and \nCboe C2 also provides three data feeds that provide only Cboe C2 \ndata. It is reasonable, however, to compare the Exchange's data \nfeeds to Cboe C2 data feeds with higher per User fees because they \ncharge the higher fee for a single data product whereas the Exchange \nincludes each of its data products for a single fee. Cboe C2 also \noffers the Cboe One Options Feed, which provides information for not \nonly Cboe C2, but also its three affiliated options markets, Cboe \nEDGX Options, Cboe, and Cboe BZX Options.\n    \\39\\ See Cboe C2 Fee Schedule, available at <a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/ctwo/\">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/ctwo/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * * * *\n    Each of the above examples of other exchanges' market data fees \nsupport the proposition that the Exchange's proposed User fees are \ncomparable to those of other exchanges and therefore reasonable.\nNon-Display Usage Fee\n    The proposed Non-Display Usage fee for the Exchange's market data \nproducts is comparable to those charged by Nasdaq Options and Nasdaq \nMRX, as summarized in below table.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           Market share                                Monthly non-display usage\n                Exchange                   [dagger] (%)      Market data products                 fee\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMIAX Sapphire...........................            3.23  All.......................  $1,500.00 (per feed\n                                                                                       (capped at $3,000.00).\nNasdaq Options..........................            5.34  NOM BONO, NOM ITTO........  $10,530.00 (per exchange).\nNasdaq MRX..............................            2.77  MRX Top, MRX Depth, MRX     $7,575.00 (per exchange).\n                                                           Spread.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[dagger] See supra note 24.\n\n    A more detailed discussion of the comparison follows.\n    Nasdaq Options.

For example, Cboe, Cboe C2, Cboe \nEDGX Options, Cboe BZX Options, BOX, and MEMX Options do not charge \nnon-display fees. Therefore, the Exchange compared its fees to two \ncomparable exchanges, Nasdaq Options and Nasdaq MRX, which charge \nnon-display fees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As discussed above, the Nasdaq Options BONO feed is an options feed \nthat provides Nasdaq Options' best bid and offer and last sale \ninformation.\\41\\ The Nasdaq Options BONO feed is similar to the \nExchange's ToM data feed.

N/A.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Dagger] See supra note 24.\n\n    As illustrated by the above table, while distributor fees may vary \nacross exchanges, and in some instances are higher on the Exchange, the \nper User fees of other exchanges are generally higher than that \nproposed by the Exchange and can quickly make up for any difference in \ndistributor fees due to an increased number of Users permissioned to \nview other exchanges' data feeds when compared to the Users \npermissioned to view data from the Exchange. In addition, Nasdaq \nOptions and Nasdaq MRX charge materially higher fees for Non-Display \nUsage. Meanwhile, Cboe BZX Options and Cboe C2 would charge non-display \nusers their applicable distribution fee, which are not capped and are \neither higher than, or comparable to, the fees proposed by the \nExchange. Furthermore, the Exchange proposes to only charge fees to \nInternal and External Distributors for the ToM, cToM and SLF feeds, \nwhich, when combined with the above proposed fees, result in fee \npackages that are generally comparable to the fee packages charged by \nNasdaq Options, Nasdaq MRX, Cboe BZX Options, and Cboe C2 due to those \nexchanges charging higher or similar User and Non-Display Usage fees, \nas set forth above.\n    Lastly, the proposed discount to charge per User fees at the \nExchange level, and not per data feed, as well as capping the monthly \nNon-Display Usage fee for use of multiple data feeds, is reasonable and \ncause the Exchange's proposed fees to be even lower for subscribers to \nmultiple Exchange data products.\n    Pro-Rata Distribution of Fees. The Exchange believes its proposal \nto remove the text that the Exchange will pro-rate mid-month changes to \nsubscriptions is reasonable because the Exchange's affiliates had no \nmid-month subscriptions or terminations over the past twelve (12) \nmonths that would have required the monthly fee to be pro-rated and no \nother options exchanges provides for the similar pro-ration of market \ndata fees.\\50\\ Also, removing these provisions would harmonize the MIAX \nSapphire Fee Schedule with the MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, which \ndoes not provide for pro-ration of market data fees.\\51\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\50\\ See Cboe BZX Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section and \nCboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, supra note 13. See also MEMX Options \nFee Schedule, Market Data Fees section and Securities Exchange Act \nRelease No. 101370 (October 17, 2024), 89 FR 84638 (October 23, \n2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n    \\51\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Definitions, and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 \n(June 12, 2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Proposed Fees Are Equitably Allocated\n    Overall. The Exchange believes that its proposed fees are \nreasonable, equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory because they are \ndesigned to align fees with services provided. The Exchange believes \nthat the proposed fees for the market data feeds are allocated fairly \nand equitably among the various categories of users of the data feeds, \nand any differences among categories of users are justified and \nappropriate.\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are equitably \nallocated because they will apply uniformly to all data recipients that \nchoose to subscribe to the market data feeds. Any market participant \nthat chooses to subscribe to the market data feeds is subject to the \nsame Fee Schedule, regardless of what type of business they operate, \nand the decision to subscribe to one or more market data feeds is based \non objective differences in usage of market data feeds\n\n[[Page 22422]]\n\namong different Members, which are still ultimately in the control of \nany particular Member. The Exchange believes the proposed pricing of \nthe market data feeds is equitably allocated because it is based, in \npart, upon the amount of information contained in each data feed, which \nmay have additional value to market participants.\n    Pro-Rata Distribution of Fees. The Exchange believes its proposal \nto remove the text that the Exchange will pro-rate mid-month changes to \nsubscriptions is equitably allocated because the Exchange's affiliates \nhad no subscriber utilize pro-ration via a mid-month subscription or \ntermination over the past twelve (12) months, nor does it foresee a \nsubscriber doing so in the near future. The Exchange believes it is \nequitable to remove the text that the Exchange will pro-rate fees for \nDistributors who subscribe mid-month because other options exchanges do \nnot provide for the similar pro-ration of market data fees.\\52\\ Also, \nremoving these provisions would harmonize the MIAX Sapphire Fee \nSchedule with the MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, which does not \nprovide for pro-ration of market data fees.\\53\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\52\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section, supra \nnote 13. See also MEMX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees \nsection and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101370 (October 17, \n2024), 89 FR 84638 (October 23, 2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n    \\53\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Definitions, and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 \n(June 12, 2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    User Fees. The Exchange believes that the proposed fee, fee levels, \nand structure that differentiates between Professional User fees from \nNon-Professional User fees for display use are equitable. This \nstructure has long been used by other exchanges and OPRA to reduce the \nprice of data to Non-Professional Users and make it more broadly \navailable.\\54\\ Offering the market data feeds to Non-Professional Users \nat a lower cost than Professional Users results in greater equity among \ndata recipients, as Professional Users are categorized as such based on \ntheir employment and participation in financial markets, and thus, are \ncompensated to participate in the markets. While Non-Professional Users \ntoo can receive significant financial benefits through their \nparticipation in the markets, the Exchange believes it is reasonable to \ncharge more to those Users who are more directly engaged in the \nmarkets.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\54\\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59544 (March \n9, 2009), 74 FR 11162 (March 16, 2009) (SR-NYSE-2008-131) \n(establishing the $15 Non-Professional User Fee (Per User) for NYSE \nOpenBook); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20002, File No. S7-\n433 (July 22, 1983), 48 FR 34552 (July 29, 1983) (establishing Non-\nProfessional fees for CTA data); NASDAQ BX Equity 7 Pricing \nSchedule, Section 123.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Non-Display Usage Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed Non-\nDisplay Usage fees are equitably allocated because they would require \nDistributors to pay fees only for the uses they actually make of the \ndata. As noted above, non-display data can be used by data recipients \nfor a wide variety of profit-generating purposes (including trading and \norder routing) as well as purposes that do not directly generate \nrevenues (such as risk management and compliance) but nonetheless \nsubstantially reduce the recipient's costs by automating certain \nfunctions. The Exchange believes that it is equitable to charge non-\ndisplay data Distributors that use the market data feeds because all \nsuch Distributors would have the ability to use such data for as many \nnon-display uses as they wish for one low fee. As noted above, this \nstructure is comparable to that in place for the exchanges referenced \nabove and several other exchanges charge multiple non-display fees to \nthe same client to the extent they use a data feed in several different \ntrading platforms or for several types of non-display use.\\55\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\55\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, available at <a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/bzx/\">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/bzx/</a> (providing fees \nof $2,000.00 to $3,000.00 for Distribution, which includes Non-\nDisplay use); Cboe C2 Fee Schedule, available at <a href=\"https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/ctwo/\">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/ctwo/</a> (providing a \nfee $2,500.00 for Distribution, which includes Non-Display use); \nNasdaq Options Fee Schedule, available at, <a href=\"https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions\">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPPriceListOptions</a> (providing a \nfee of $10,000.00 for Non-Display Use); and the NYSE American fee \nschedule, available at <a href=\"https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Market_Data_Pricing.pdf\">https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Market_Data_Pricing.pdf</a> (providing a fee of $5,000.00 for Non-\nDisplay Use).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * * * *\n    For all of the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the \nproposed fees for the market data feeds are equitably allocated.\nThe Proposed Fees Are Not Unfairly Discriminatory\n    The Exchange believes the proposed fees are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory because any differences in the application of the fees \nare based on meaningful distinctions between customers, and those \nmeaningful distinctions are not unfairly discriminatory between \ncustomers.\n    Overall. The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are not \nunfairly discriminatory because they would apply to all data recipients \nthat choose to subscribe to the same market data feed(s). Any market \nparticipant, including market data vendors, that chooses to subscribe \nto the market data feeds is subject to the same Fee Schedule, \nregardless of what type of business they operate. Market participants \nseeking lower cost options may instead choose to receive data from OPRA \nor another potentially lower cost option such as a market data vendor. \nThe Exchange notes that market participants can also choose to \nsubscribe to a combination of data feeds for redundancy purposes or to \nuse different feeds for different purposes. In sum, each market \nparticipant has the ability to choose the best business solution for \nitself. The Exchange does not believe it is unfairly discriminatory to \nbase pricing upon the amount of information contained in each data feed \nand the importance of that information to market participants. As \ndescribed above, the ToM data feed can be utilized to trade on the \nExchange but contains less information than available on the SLF data \nfeed. Thus, the Exchange believes it is not unfairly discriminatory for \nthe products to be priced as proposed, with the same fees being \nproposed for each data feed coupled with the discounts and caps \ndiscussed above.\n    Pro-Rata Distribution of Fees. The Exchange believes that the \nproposal to remove the text that the Exchange will pro-rate mid-month \nchanges to market data subscriptions is not unfairly discriminatory \nbecause the Exchange's affiliates had no mid-month subscriptions or \nterminations over the past twelve (12) months that would have required \nthe monthly fee to be pro-rated. The Exchange notes that other options \nexchanges do not provide for the similar pro-ration of market data \nfees.\\56\\ Also, removing these provisions would harmonize the MIAX \nSapphire Fee Schedule with the MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, which \ndoes not provide for pro-ration.\\57\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\56\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section, supra \nnote 13. See also MEMX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees \nsection and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101370 (October 17, \n2024), 89 FR 84638 (October 23, 2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n    \\57\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Definitions and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 \n(June 12, 2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    User Fees. The Exchange believes that the proposed fee, fee levels, \nand structure that differentiates between Professional User fees from \nNon-Professional User fees for display use are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory. This structure has long been used by other exchanges \nand OPRA to reduce the\n\n[[Page 22423]]\n\nprice of data to Non-Professional Users and make it more broadly \navailable. Offering the market data feeds to Non-Professional Users \nwith the same data as is available to Professional Users, albeit at a \nlower cost, results in greater equity among data recipients. These User \nfees would be charged uniformly to all individuals that have access to \nthe market data feeds based on the category of User.\n    The Exchange also believes the proposed User fees are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory, with higher fees for Professional Users than Non-\nProfessional Users, because Non-Professional Users may have less \nability to pay for such data than Professional Users as well as less \nopportunity to profit from their usage of such data.\n    Non-Display Usage Fees. The Exchange believes that the proposed \nNon-Display Usage fees are not unfairly discriminatory because they \nwould require Distributors for non-display use to pay fees depending on \ntheir use of the data. As noted above, non-display data can be used by \ndata recipients for a wide variety of profit-generating purposes as \nwell as purposes that do not directly generate revenues but nonetheless \nsubstantially reduce the recipient's costs by automating certain \nfunctions.\n* * * * *\n    For all of the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the \nproposed fees for the Exchange's market data feeds are not unfairly \ndiscriminatory.\n* * * * *\nRemove Initial Waiver Period Rule Text\n    The Exchange believes its proposal to remove the rule text \nregarding the Initial Waiver Period below the table of fees in Sections \n6)a) and b) of the Fee Schedule is reasonable, equitable and not \nunfairly discriminatory because the Initial Waiver Period automatically \nexpired at the end of February 2025. Upon the expiration of the Initial \nWaiver Period, effective March 1, 2025, the market data fees in \nSections 6)a)-b) of the Fee Schedule began to apply to all market \nparticipants equally who subscribe to the ToM, cToM, and/or SLF data \nfeeds. This proposed change will also remove impediments to and perfect \nthe mechanism of a free and open market because it will remove text \nthat no longer apples from the Fee Schedule, thereby providing clarity \nto market participants regarding the Exchange's market data fees. It is \nin the public interest for the Fee Schedule to be clear.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\\58\\ the Exchange \ndoes not believe that the proposed rule change would impose any burden \non competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of \nthe purposes of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\58\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntra-Market Competition\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed fees place certain \nmarket participants at a relative disadvantage to other market \nparticipants because, as noted above, the proposed fees are associated \nwith usage of the data feed by each market participant, which are still \nultimately in the control of any particular Member, and such fees do \nnot impose a barrier to entry to smaller participants. Accordingly, the \nproposed fees do not favor certain categories of market participants in \na manner that would impose a burden on competition; rather, the \nallocation of the proposed fees reflects the types of data consumed by \nvarious market participants and their usage thereof. The Exchange also \nbelieves that the proposed fees neither favor nor penalize one or more \ncategories of market participants in a manner that would impose an \nundue burden on competition.\n    The Exchange believes its proposal to no longer pro-rate mid-month \nchanges to market data subscriptions does not place an undue burden on \nintra-market competition because all market participants will be \nsubject to the same Fee Schedule, regardless of which point in the \nmonth they subscribe. As noted above, the Exchange's affiliates had no \nmid-month subscriptions or terminations over the past twelve (12) \nmonths that would have required the monthly fee to be pro-rated. The \nExchange notes that other options exchanges do not provide for the \nsimilar pro-ration of market data fees.\\59\\ Also, removing these \nprovisions would harmonize the MIAX Sapphire Fee Schedule with the MIAX \nPearl Equities Fee Schedule, which does not provide for pro-ration.\\60\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\59\\ See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section \nand Cboe EDGX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section. See \nalso MEMX Options Fee Schedule, Market Data Fees section and \nSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 101370 (October 17, 2024), 89 FR \n84638 (October 23, 2024) (SR-MEMX-2024-40).\n    \\60\\ See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 3), Market \nData Definitions and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100319 \n(June 12, 2024), 89 FR 51562 (June 19, 2024) (SR-PEARL-2024-25).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInter-Market Competition\n    The Exchange does not believe the proposed fees place an undue \nburden on competition on other SROs that is not necessary or \nappropriate. In particular, market participants are not forced to \nsubscribe to either data feed, as described above. An exchange that \noverprices its market data products stands a high risk that users may \npurchase another market's market data product. These competitive \npressures ensure that no one exchange's market data fees can impose an \nunnecessary burden on competition, and the Exchange's proposed fees do \nnot do so here. Additionally, other exchanges have similar market data \nfees with comparable rates in place for their participants. Other \noptions exchanges are free to adopt comparable fee structures subject \nto the Commission's rule filing process.\n    The Exchange believes its proposal to remove the rule text \nregarding the Initial Waiver Period below the table of fees in Sections \n6)a) and b) of the Fee Schedule will not impose any burden on \ncompetition because the Initial Waiver Period automatically expired at \nthe end of February 2025. Upon the expiration of the Initial Waiver \nPeriod, effective March 1, 2025, the market data fees in Sections 6)a)-\nb) of the Fee Schedule began to apply to all market participants \nequally who subscribe to the ToM, cToM, and/or SLF data feeds. This \nproposed change is not competitive; rather it is to remove text that no \nlonger apples from the Fee Schedule, thereby providing clarity to \nmarket participants regarding the Exchange's market data fees.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act,\\61\\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) \\62\\ thereunder. \nAt any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, \nthe Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it \nappears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate \nin the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such \naction, the Commission shall institute proceedings to determine\n\n[[Page 22424]]\n\nwhether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\61\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii).\n    \\62\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.

Introduction\n\n    On January 31, 2025, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the ``Exchange'' \nor ``Nasdaq'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \\1\\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\\2\\ a \nproposed rule change to introduce an optional functionality for \nExchange-Traded Products to initiate a trading halt on the launch day \nof an Exchange-Traded Product, similar to the halt used in initial \npublic offerings (``IPOs''). The proposed rule change was published for \ncomment in the Federal Register on February 20, 2025.\\3\\ On March 6, \n2025, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act,\\4\\ the \nCommission designated a longer period within which to approve the \nproposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute \nproceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule \nchange.\\5\\ On May 6, 2025, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1, which \namends and replaces the proposed rule change in its entirety.\\6\\ The \nCommission has received no comments on the proposed rule change. The \nCommission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on Amendment \nNo. 1 to the proposed rule change from interested persons, and is \napproving the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, on \nan accelerated basis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n    \\3\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102413 (February 13, \n2025), 90 FR 10001.\n    \\4\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).\n    \\5\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102537, 90 FR 11866 \n(March 12, 2025). The Commission designated May 21, 2025, as the \ndate by which the Commission shall approve or disapprove, or \ninstitute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the \nproposed rule change.\n    \\6\\ In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange added clarifying or \ncorrective changes that, among other things: (1) provides additional \nbackground on how an ETP opens today and rationale on why the \nExchange is proposing the Initial ETP Open; (2) specifies that the \nExchange would only assign one DLP per ETP in the context of the \nproposed Initial ETP Open; (3) deletes the Regulation M statement \nrelating to the DLP in proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(A) because the \nExchange inadvertently included this statement when it does not \napply in the context of this proposal; (4) adds more granularity in \nproposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(B)(i) about the DLP notifying the Exchange \nthat the ETP is ready to trade; (5) clarifies that price bands would \nbe set exchange-wide and not on a security-by-security basis; (6) \nspecifies the DLP's responsibilities in the proposed Initial ETP \nOpen; and (7) clarifies that the IPO Indicator will provide the same \ninformation in the Order Imbalance Indicator under this proposal. \nAmendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change is available on the \nCommission's website at: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nasdaq-2025-011/srnasdaq2025011.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nasdaq-2025-011/srnasdaq2025011.htm</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nII. Exchange's Description of the Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by \nAmendment No. 1\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization \nincluded statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the \nproposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the \nproposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at \nthe places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared \nsummaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most \nsignificant parts of such statements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend its Equity 1--Equity Definitions and \nEquity 4--Equity Trading Rules to allow Exchange-Traded Products \n(``ETPs'') \\7\\ to utilize an optional new halt on launch day \n(hereinafter, the ``Initial ETP Open''), and resume trading using the \nNasdaq Halt Cross.\\8\\ As discussed in detail below, the proposed \nInitial ETP Open is designed to operate similarly to Nasdaq's IPO \nopening process for\n\n[[Page 22425]]\n\ncorporate securities with specified differences to account for the \nunique characteristics of ETPs. With this proposal, an ETP issuer \nlaunching the ETP on the first day of trading would have the option to \nopen the security at the start of Pre-Market Hours \\9\\ at 4:00 a.m. \nEastern Time (``ET''), which is the case today, or delay the opening of \nthe security pursuant to the proposed Initial ETP Open process until \nMarket Hours.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ As discussed later in this filing, the Exchange will add \n``Exchange-Traded Products'' as a defined term in Equity 1, Section \n1(a).\n    \\8\\ The ``Nasdaq Halt Cross'' is the process for determining the \nprice at which Eligible Interest shall be executed at the open of \ntrading for a halted security and for executing that Eligible \nInterest. See Rule 4753(a)(4). ``Eligible Interest'' shall mean any \nquotation or any order that has been entered into the system and \ndesignated with a time-in-force that would allow the order to be in \nforce at the time of the Halt Cross. See Equity 4, Rule 4753(a)(5).\n    \\9\\ The term ``Pre-Market Hours'' means the period of time \nbeginning at 4:00 a.m. ET and ending immediately prior to the \ncommencement of Market Hours. See Equity 1, Section 1(a)(9).\n    \\10\\ The term ``Market Hours'' means the period of time \nbeginning at 9:30 a.m. ET and ending at 4:00 p.m. ET (or such \nearlier time as may be designated by Nasdaq on a day when Nasdaq \ncloses early). See Equity 1, Section 1(a)(9).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    This functionality is intended to support efficient price discovery \nby enabling ETP issuers to enter a halt on launch day, for a specified \ntime period, after which the ETP can be manually opened. This proposed \nrule would enable ETP issuers to maximize the chances of more efficient \nprice discovery on launch day while also ensuring there are safeguards \nfor the opening price to protect investors against unexpected \nvolatility in the pricing of the ETP. As proposed, an ETP's initial \nprice would be determined based on market interest and, similar to \nother auction processes, the matching of buy and sell orders in this \nauction would be open to all market participants.\nBackground\n    Today, ETPs open for trading on Nasdaq at 4:00 a.m. ET at the start \nof Pre-Market Hours where the ETP becomes available for buying and \nselling during that time period. The ETP then participates in Nasdaq's \nOpening Cross at 9:30 a.m. ET pursuant to Rule 4752. This is the case \nfor an ETP's initial day of trading as well as any other trading day \nfor the ETP. While the Exchange has not experienced issues with opening \nETPs at 4:00 a.m. ET, ETP issuers have indicated to the Exchange their \ndesire for a more high-touch launch day opening process for some ETPs, \nsimilar to the Exchange's IPO opening process for corporate securities. \nSimilar to the existing IPO process for corporate securities, the \nproposed process for ETPs would delay the opening of the security until \nMarket Hours, and the security would be released for trading pursuant \nto the Halt Cross process in Rule 4753. The Exchange is not proposing \nto use the Opening Cross under Rule 4752 to release the ETP for trading \nin this instance because the Exchange is seeking to prevent trading in \nthe ETP on its first day under this proposal until at least 9:40 a.m. \nET, as described below, and then have the ETP enter the Halt Cross \nprocess under Rule 4753 in order to be released for trading. In \ncontrast, the Opening Cross contemplates that there could be active \ntrading in a security prior to that auction process, as the Opening \nCross utilizes prevailing market bids and offers to establish \nthresholds for establishing Nasdaq opening prices.\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ See Rule 4752(d). See also <a href=\"https://nasdaqtrader.com/content/productsservices/trading/crosses/openclose_faqs.pdf\">https://nasdaqtrader.com/content/productsservices/trading/crosses/openclose_faqs.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Today, securities of companies listing on Nasdaq in an IPO are \nhalted pursuant to Equity 4, Rule 4120(a)(7) until such time as the \nconditions in 4120(c)(8) are satisfied, and the Exchange releases the \nIPO security for trading pursuant to the Nasdaq Halt Cross in Rule \n4753.\\12\\ In the context of an IPO, the Nasdaq Halt Cross is also \nreferred to herein as the ``IPO Halt Cross.'' Prior to the cross \nexecution, market participants may enter quotes and orders eligible for \nparticipation in the cross. Pursuant to Rule 4120(c)(8), prior to \nterminating the IPO halt, the security enters a Display Only Period \nduring which indicative information about the potential outcome of the \nNasdaq Halt Cross is displayed to market participants every second via \nthe Order Imbalance Indicator,\\13\\ and during which market participants \nmay continue to enter orders and quotes in that security in Nasdaq \nsystems.\\14\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ In general, Equity 4, Rule 4120(a) sets forth Nasdaq's \nauthority to initiate trading halts or pauses in the circumstances \nspecified thereunder. Equity 4, Rule 4120(c) then sets forth the \nvarious procedures for initiating and terminating such trading \nhalts. Equity 4, Rule 4753 then sets forth procedures for the \nresumption of trading following various trading halts enumerated in \nRule 4120(a). Specifically, Rule 4753(b) provides, in part, that for \nNasdaq-listed securities that are the subject of a trading halt \ninitiated pursuant to Rule 4120(a)(7) (i.e., the IPO halt), the \nNasdaq Halt Cross shall occur at the time specified by Nasdaq \npursuant to Rule 4120, and Market Hours trading would commence when \nthe Nasdaq Halt Cross concludes.\n    \\13\\ ``Order Imbalance Indicator'' means a message disseminated \nby electronic means containing information about Eligible Interest \nand the price at which such interest would execute at the time of \ndissemination. The Order Imbalance Indicator shall disseminate the \nfollowing information: (A) Current Reference Price, (B) the number \nof shares of Eligible Interest that are paired at the Current \nReference Price, (C) the size of any Imbalance or Market Order \nImbalance, as applicable, (D) the buy/sell direction of any \nImbalance or Market Order Imbalance, as applicable, and (E) \nindicative prices at which the Nasdaq Halt Cross would occur if the \nNasdaq Halt Cross were to occur at that time. See Rule 4753(a)(3).\n    \\14\\ Equity 4, Rule 4753(b)(1) provides that at the beginning of \nthe Display Only Period and continuing through the resumption of \ntrading, Nasdaq would disseminate by electronic means an Order \nImbalance Indicator every second.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Rule 4120(c)(8) further states that after the conclusion of the \nDisplay Only Period, the IPO security enters a ``Pre-Launch Period'' of \nindeterminate duration, during which indicative information continues \nto be disseminated,\\15\\ and market participants are able to submit and \ncancel orders as they are currently able to do so during the Display \nOnly Period. The Pre-Launch Period ends and the security is released \nfor trading by Nasdaq when the conditions described in paragraphs \n(c)(8)(A)(i), (ii), and (iii) of Rule 4120 are all met:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See Equity 4, Rule 4753(b)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> Nasdaq receives notice from the underwriter of the IPO \nthat the security is ready to trade. The Nasdaq system then calculates \nthe Current Reference Price \\16\\ at that time (the ``Expected Price'') \nand displays it to the underwriter. If the underwriter then approves \nproceeding, the Nasdaq system will conduct two validation checks.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ ``Current Reference Price'' means: (i) The single price at \nwhich the maximum number of shares of Eligible Interest can be \npaired. (ii) If more than one price exists under subparagraph (i), \nthe Current Reference Price shall mean the price that minimizes any \nImbalance. (iii) If more than one price exists under subparagraph \n(ii), the Current Reference Price shall mean the entered price at \nwhich shares will remain unexecuted in the cross. (iv) If more than \none price exists under subparagraph (iii), the Current Reference \nPrice shall mean: (a) In the case of an IPO, the price that is \nclosest to the Issuer's Initial Public Offering Price; (b) In the \ncase of the initial pricing of a security listing under Listing \nRules IM-5315-1, IM-5405-1, or IM-5505-1, for a security that has \nhad recent sustained trading in a Private Placement Market (as \ndefined in Rule 5005(a)(34)) prior to listing, the most recent \ntransaction price in that market or, if none, a price determined by \nthe Exchange in consultation with the financial advisor to the \nissuer identified pursuant to Rule 4120(c)(9); (c) In the case of \nthe initial pricing of a security listing under Listing Rule IM-\n5315-2, the price that is closest to the price that is 20% below \n(calculated as provided for in Listing Rule IM-5315-2) the lowest \nprice of the price range disclosed by the issuer in its effective \nregistration statement; (d) In the case of another halt type in \nwhich the security has already traded during normal market hours on \nthat trading day, the price that is closest to the last Nasdaq \nexecution prior to the trading halt; (e) In the case of another halt \ntype in which the security has not already traded during normal \nmarket hours on that trading day, the price that is closest to the \nprevious Nasdaq Official Closing Price; and (f) In the case of the \ninitial pricing of a security that traded in the over-the-counter \nmarket pursuant to FINRA Form 211 immediately prior to the initial \npricing, the price that is closest to the most recent transaction \nprice in that market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Order \nImbalance Indicator will not include the Current Reference Price if \nthere is a Market Order Imbalance. See Rule 4753(a)(3)(A).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> First, the Nasdaq system must determine that all market \norders will be executed in the Nasdaq Halt Cross; and\n    <bullet> Second, the security must pass the price validation test \ndescribed in subparagraph (C) of Rule 4120(c)(8), which essentially \nprovides that if the actual price calculated by the Nasdaq Halt Cross \ndiffers from the Expected\n\n[[Page 22426]]\n\nPrice by an amount in excess of a price band previously selected by the \nunderwriter, the security will not be released for trading and the Pre-\nLaunch period will continue.\n    As provided in Rule 4120(c)(8)(A), the failure to satisfy these \nconditions during the process to release the security for trading would \nresult in a delay of the release for trading of the IPO security, and a \ncontinuation of the Pre-Launch Period, until all conditions have been \nsatisfied. Market participants may continue to enter orders and order \ncancellations for participation in the IPO Halt Cross during the Pre-\nLaunch Period up to the point that the IPO Halt Cross auction process \ncommences pursuant to Equity 4, Rule 4753(b).\n    The Exchange believes that the IPO opening process described above \nhas worked well in the context of Nasdaq-listed corporate securities to \nprovide fair executions for investors through an open and transparent \nprocess that protects against unexpected volatility in the pricing of \nan IPO security. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to adopt a similar \nprocess for Nasdaq-listed ETPs. Unlike the IPO opening process, the \nInitial ETP Open will involve a Designated Liquidity Provider (``DLP'') \n\\17\\ (i.e., the Nasdaq market maker for the ETP) instead of an \nunderwriter, such that Nasdaq would display the Expected Price of the \nNasdaq Halt Cross for the ETP to the DLP, who will select price bands \nto ensure that the actual calculated price at which the Nasdaq Halt \nCross would occur does not deviate from the Expected Price by more than \nthe selected price band amounts. Additionally, the Exchange is \nproposing to submit the ETP for validation checks at 9:45 a.m. ET at \nthe latest without exception, whereas under the existing IPO process, \nthe Exchange does not submit the IPO security for validation checks \nuntil the underwriter approves proceeding.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Equity 7, Section 11(f)(2) provides that a ``Designated \nLiquidity Provider'' or ``DLP'' is a registered Nasdaq market maker \nfor a Qualified Security (i.e., an ETP) that has committed to \nmaintain minimum performance standards. A DLP shall be selected by \nNasdaq based on factors including, but not limited to, experience \nwith making markets in exchange-traded products, adequacy of \ncapital, willingness to promote Nasdaq as a marketplace, issuer \npreference, operational capacity, support personnel, and history of \nadherence to Nasdaq rules and securities laws. Nasdaq may limit the \nnumber of DLPs in a security, or modify a previously established \nlimit, upon prior written notice to members.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposal\n    The Exchange proposes to amend (1) Equity 1, Section 1(a) to add a \nnew definition for ``Exchange-Traded Products,'' (2) Equity 4, Rule \n4120(a) to provide the Exchange with explicit authority to declare a \ntrading halt in a Nasdaq-listed ETP on its first day of trading, \nprovided specified conditions are met, (3) Equity 4, Rule 4120(c) to \nadd the process by which the Exchange will initiate and terminate the \nproposed trading halt for Nasdaq-listed ETPs, (4) Equity 4, Rule \n4753(b) to include the proposed trading halt in the list of enumerated \nprovisions that would be subject to the Nasdaq Halt Cross, and (5) \nEquity 7, Section 115(i) to specify that an ETP issuer may subscribe to \nthe IPO Workstation at no cost.\n    The Exchange first proposes to add a new definition for ``Exchange-\nTraded Products'' in Equity 1, Section 1(a). Specifically, the Exchange \nproposes to add in new paragraph (15) that the term ``Exchange-Traded \nProduct'' means a security listed on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Rules \n5704, 5705, 5710, 5711, 5713, 5715, 5720, 5735, 5745, 5750 or 5760. The \nproposed definition aligns to the definition of ``Qualified \nSecurities'' set forth in the Exchange's Designated Liquidity Provider \nprogram in Equity 7, Section 114(f).\\18\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ As set forth in Equity 7, Section 114(f)(1), a security may \nbe designated as a ``Qualified Security'' if: (A) it is an exchange-\ntraded product listed on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Rules 5704, 5705, \n5710, 5711, 5713, 5715, 5720, 5735, 5745, 5750 or 5760; and (B) it \nhas at least one Designated Liquidity Provider.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In proposed Equity 4, Rule 4120(a)(15), the Exchange proposes to \nexplicitly provide that the Exchange has authority to halt trading in a \nNasdaq-listed ETP on its first day of trading, provided specified \nconditions are met. Specifically, proposed Rule 4120(a)(15) will \nprovide that Nasdaq may halt trading in an ETP for which Nasdaq is the \nprimary listing market on the first day of trading, provided that (i) \nthe issuer of the ETP being listed opts into this process, and (ii) a \nbroker-dealer serving in the role of DLP to the issuer of the ETP being \nlisted is willing to perform the functions under this Rule.\\19\\ The \nproposed Initial ETP Open will be offered on an optional basis such \nthat an ETP issuer would have the option on the ETP's initial launch \nday of opening the ETP at 4:00 a.m. ET (i.e., the current process), or \ndelaying the opening until Market Hours with the new Initial ETP Open \nprocess. The Exchange notes that certain ETP issuers may want to open \nat 4:00 a.m. ET on launch day instead of delaying the opening until \nMarket Hours as proposed hereunder because of the availability for \nearlier buying and selling in the ETP. Other ETP issuers may seek to \nuse the Initial ETP Open to delay the opening of the ETP until Market \nHours because of increased trading activity in the ETP and its \nunderlying component securities, making pricing in the ETP potentially \nless volatile. The Exchange believes that ETP issuers, in consultation \nwith the DLP, with their understanding of the ETP, are best situated to \nmake the decision whether to open during pre-market or regular market \nhours, and therefore proposes to give them the option to choose one \nprocess over the other. The Exchange further believes that the DLP, \nwith their market knowledge of the book and an understanding of the \nETP, would be well placed to notify the Exchange when the ETP should be \nreleased for trading and approve the Exchange proceeding with the price \nvalidation checks after the DLP receives the Expected Price.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ In practice, Nasdaq currently only assigns one DLP per ETP. \nShould Nasdaq determine to assign more than one DLP per ETP in the \ncontext of this proposed Initial ETP Open, Nasdaq will submit \nanother rule filing to describe which DLP would perform which \nfunction in the Initial ETP Open.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange proposes in new paragraph (c)(11) to Equity 4, Rule \n4120 to add the process by which the Exchange will initiate and \nterminate the trading halt that is being proposed under Rule \n4120(a)(15), as described above. Specifically, Nasdaq proposes under \nEquity 4, Rule 4120(c)(11)(A) that the process for halting and initial \npricing of a Nasdaq-listed ETP that is the subject of an Initial ETP \nOpen pursuant to Rule 4120(a)(15) and this Rule, respectively, will be \navailable on an optional basis, provided that the conditions in Rule \n4120(a)(15)(i) and (ii) above are met.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ As discussed above, the conditions in proposed Rule \n4120(a)(15)(i) and (ii) provide that Nasdaq may halt trading in an \nETP for which Nasdaq is the primary listing market on the first day \nof trading, provided that (i) the issuer of the ETP being listed \nopts into this process, and (ii) a broker-dealer serving in the role \nof DLP to the issuer of the ETP being listed is willing to perform \nthe functions under this Rule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(B) will set forth the process and \nconditions for terminating a trading halt initiated under proposed Rule \n4120(a)(15), which will be similar to the existing IPO opening process \nin Rule 4120(c)(8) in the manner discussed below. Similar to the \ncurrent IPO opening process, beginning at 9:30 a.m. ET, the ETP would \nenter a 10-minute Display Only Period prior to the termination of the \nhalt, during which (and up until the resumption of trading) indicative \ninformation about the potential outcome of the Nasdaq Halt Cross that \nwill be conducted for the ETP will be displayed to market participants \nevery second\n\n[[Page 22427]]\n\nthrough an Order Imbalance Indicator,\\21\\ and during which market \nparticipants may continue to enter orders, quotes, and cancellations in \nthat ETP in Nasdaq systems.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ See supra note 10.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Specifically, proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(B) will provide that a \ntrading halt initiated under Rule 4120(a)(15) shall be terminated when \nNasdaq releases the security for trading and the conditions described \nin sub-paragraphs (B)(i)-(iii) are satisfied.\\22\\ Prior to terminating \nthe halt, there will be a 10-minute Display Only Period during which \nmarket participants may enter quotes and orders in that security in \nNasdaq systems. Before the Display Only Period begins and once the \nsecurity is set up in the Nasdaq system during Pre-Market Hours, market \nparticipants may enter orders in a security that is the subject of an \nInitial ETP Open on Nasdaq.\\23\\ Such orders will be accepted and \nentered into the system.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ As discussed later in this filing, proposed sub-paragraphs \n(B)(i)-(iii) will set forth the conditions for when the Pre-Launch \nperiod will end and when the ETP will be released for trading.\n    \\23\\ Nasdaq will begin accepting orders in ETP securities when \nNasdaq staff manually starts up the order window during Pre-Market \nHours and before the Display Only Period.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(B) will also provide that after the \nconclusion of the 10-minute Display Only Period, the security will \nenter a ``Pre-Launch Period.'' Similar to the IPO opening process \ndiscussed above, the Exchange would continue to disseminate throughout \nthe Pre-Launch Period (and up until the resumption of trading) an Order \nImbalance Indicator every second.\\24\\ Market participants would also be \nable to submit and cancel interest during the Pre-Launch Period for the \nInitial ETP Open as they do today during the Pre-Launch Period for an \nIPO opening process. Proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(B) will further provide \nthat the Pre-Launch Period shall end and the security shall be released \nfor trading by Nasdaq when the following conditions in proposed sub-\nparagraphs (B)(i)-(iii) are all met:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ See supra note 10.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> The ETP will be submitted for the validation checks \npursuant to subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (iii) below by 9:45 a.m. ET at \nthe latest. Prior to this time, if Nasdaq receives notice by 9:40 a.m. \nET from the DLP of the Initial ETP Open that the ETP is ready to \ntrade,\\25\\ the Nasdaq system will calculate the Current Reference Price \n(as defined in Rule 4753(a)(3)(A)) (the ``Expected Price'') at 9:40 \na.m. ET and display it to the DLP.\\26\\ If the DLP then approves \nproceeding, the Nasdaq system will conduct the validation checks in \nsubparagraphs (B)(ii) and (iii) below before releasing the ETP for \ntrading pursuant to the Nasdaq Halt Cross.\\27\\ If no notice is received \nby 9:40 a.m. ET, the Nasdaq system will assume the DLP is ready to \ntrade. Accordingly, the Nasdaq system will calculate the Expected \nPrice, and then conduct the validation checks in subparagraphs (B)(ii) \nand (iii) below before releasing the ETP for trading pursuant to the \nNasdaq Halt Cross.\\28\\ If the DLP notifies the Exchange by 9:40 a.m. ET \nthat the ETP is not ready to trade, Nasdaq will recalculate the \nExpected Price and display it to the DLP until the DLP approves \nproceeding. However, by 9:45 a.m. at the latest, the Nasdaq system will \nconduct the following validation checks:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ The Exchange notes that if the DLP instead notified Nasdaq \nthat the ETP was not ready to trade, the Exchange would wait until \n9:45 a.m. ET at the latest for the DLP to confirm that the ETP was \nready, and once confirmation is received within that time frame, the \nExchange would conduct the validation checks and open the ETP for \ntrading pursuant to the Nasdaq Halt Cross once the validation checks \nwere passed.\n    \\26\\ See supra note 13. The Exchange will display the Expected \nPrice (i.e., the Current Reference Price as defined in the Nasdaq \nHalt Cross rule in Rule 4753(a)(3)(A)) to the DLP and all market \nparticipants via the Order Imbalance Indicator.\n    \\27\\ Upon passing the validation checks, the Pre-Launch Period \nwill end and Nasdaq will open the ETP for trading pursuant to the \nNasdaq Halt Cross in Rule 4753. If the ETP does not pass the \nvalidation checks, the Pre-Launch Period will continue and Nasdaq \nwill recommence another round of validation checks. This is an \niterative process. The ETP will not open for trading until it passes \nthe validation checks. Further, if the DLP does not approve \nproceeding, then the Nasdaq system will recalculate the Expected \nPrice and display it to the DLP (and all other market participants) \nvia Order Imbalance Indicator until the DLP approves proceeding to \nthe Nasdaq system conducting the two validation checks in \nsubparagraphs (B)(ii) and (B)(iii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, \nthe ETP will be submitted for the validation checks by 9:45 a.m. ET \nat the latest. See Rule 4120(c)(8)(i) for similar provisions with \nrespect to the underwriter and the IPO opening process, except the \nExchange is proposing to submit the ETP for validation checks by \n9:45 a.m. ET at the latest and is also proposing to add a scenario \nwhere Nasdaq receives no notice by 9:40 a.m. ET.\n    \\28\\ In this instance, the Exchange will conduct the validation \nchecks in proposed subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (B)(iii) of Rule \n4120(c)(11) at 9:40 a.m. ET, and then open the ETP for trading \npursuant to the Nasdaq Halt Cross upon passing the validation \nchecks.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> First, the Nasdaq system must determine that all market \norders will be executed in the Nasdaq Halt Cross; and \\29\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ The intent of this restriction is to ensure that if a \nmarket participant enters an order offering to buy or sell in the \nNasdaq Halt Cross at any price, the cross should not occur unless \nall such orders can be executed. The Exchange notes that the IPO \nopening process has an identical restriction for the same reasons. \nSee Rule 4120(c)(8)(A)(ii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> Second, the security must pass the price validation test \ndescribed below in proposed subparagraph (C) of Rule 4120(c)(11).\\30\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ See Rule 4120(c)(8)(A)(iii) for identical provisions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Proposed subparagraph (C) of Rule 4120(c)(11) will provide that \nprior to the conclusion of the Pre-Launch Period, the DLP may select \nprice bands for purposes of applying the price validation test.\\31\\ \nUnder the price validation test, the System compares the Expected Price \nwith the actual price calculated by the Nasdaq Halt Cross. If the \nactual price calculated by the Nasdaq Halt Cross differs from the \nExpected Price by an amount in excess of the price band, the security \nwill not be released for trading and the Pre-Launch Period will \ncontinue. The DLP may select an upper price band (i.e., an amount by \nwhich the actual price may not exceed the Expected Price) and a lower \nprice band (i.e., an amount by which the actual price may not be lower \nthan the Expected Price). If a security does not pass the price \nvalidation test, the DLP may, but is not required to, select different \nprice bands before recommencing the process to release the security for \ntrading.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\31\\ The DLP can select the price bands at any time before or \nduring the Display Only Period or Pre-Launch Period, and can modify \nthem at any time prior to the conclusion of the Pre-Launch Period. \nAs discussed later in this filing, DLPs may choose price bands \nwithin the range of $0.00 to $0.50. If the DLP does not select any \nprice bands, the default bands will be set at $0.00.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For example, assume that the Expected Price for the Nasdaq Halt \nCross shown to the DLP was $32 per share, and the DLP selected an upper \nprice band of $0.10 and a lower price band of $0.05. In that case, the \nactual price calculated by the system for the cross could not be higher \nthan $32.10 nor lower than $31.95.\n    The price bands available for selection shall be in such \nincrements, and at such price points, as may be established from time \nto time by Nasdaq; the available price bands shall include $0 but shall \nnot be in excess of $0.50. The initial available price bands will range \nfrom $0 to $0.50, with increments of $0.01. Thus, the DLP may select a \nprice band of $0 (i.e., no change from the Expected Price would be \npermitted in this instance), $0.01, $0.02, or any other $0.01 increment \nup to $0.50. The DLP may select different price bands above and below \nthe Expected Price. The Exchange reserves the right to stipulate wider \nincrements (such as $0.05) or price bands that include certain price \npoints but exclude others (for example, increments of $0.01\n\n[[Page 22428]]\n\nup to $0.10, and increments of $0.05 thereafter). However, the Exchange \nwill not (in the absence of the submission of a proposed rule change) \nallow price bands wider than $0.50, as proposed in Rule 4120(c)(11)(C). \nNasdaq will notify member organizations and the public of changes in \navailable price band or increments through a notice that is widely \ndisseminated at least one week in advance of the change.\\32\\ In \nselecting available price bands and increments, Nasdaq will consider \ninput from DLPs and other market participants and the results of past \nusage of price bands to adopt price bands and increments that promote \nefficiency in the initiation of trading and protect investors and the \npublic interest.\\33\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ Price bands will be set exchange-wide, not on a security-\nby-security basis.\n    \\33\\ See proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(C), which is similar to Rule \n4120(c)(8)(B). The Exchange is proposing to add language about \nreserving the right to use wider bands, which is also true for the \nIPO process today even though the current IPO rule is silent in this \nregard.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Similar to the IPO opening process, the failure to satisfy the \nconditions in proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(B)(i)-(iii) during the process \nto release the security for trading will result in a delay of the \nrelease for trading of the Initial ETP Open, and a continuation of the \nPre-Launch Period, until all conditions have been satisfied.\\34\\ Thus, \nif the conditions have not been satisfied, the Pre-Launch Period would \ncontinue seamlessly, with members able to continue to enter or cancel \norders. The ETP would then repeat the process for release until such \ntime the conditions required for launch (i.e., proposed Rule \n4120(c)(11)(B)(i)-(iii)) were satisfied). Thus, the DLP would be shown \nthe applicable Expected Price, and the ETP would launch if all market \norders would be executed and the price validation in proposed Rule \n4120(c)(11)(C) was satisfied. This process can continue until 9:45 a.m. \nET, at which point the ETP would open pursuant to the Nasdaq Halt Cross \nupon passing the validation checks. The Exchange believes that opening \nthe ETP at 9:45 a.m. ET with no exceptions is appropriate because by \nthat time, the DLP would be expected to step in and respond to any \nexcess demand, and any excess volatility in the ETP would be protected \nthrough the proposed validation checks. Under the proposed Initial ETP \nOpen, DLPs may set the price bands that would apply in the price \nvalidation checks,\\35\\ notify Nasdaq that the ETP is ready to trade \nprior to 9:45 a.m. ET, and approve Nasdaq proceeding with the price \nvalidation checks after the DLP receives the Expected Price. Further, \nDLPs are incentivized under Nasdaq's DLP program in Equity 7, Section \n114(f) to provide liquidity and participate in the Initial ETP Open.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\34\\ See proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(B), which is similar to Rule \n4120(c)(8)(A).\n    \\35\\ See supra note 28 and accompanying text.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In addition, unlike an IPO where only the underwriter may provide \nmarkets in the corporate security on the first day of trading, other \nliquidity providers in addition to the DLP may step in and begin \nproviding markets in an ETP on its first day of trading, which could \nfurther promote price stability in the ETP . Similar to the IPO opening \nprocess, a DLP would be able (but not required) to select different \nprice bands for each attempt to launch the ETP. Thus, a DLP might \nselect an upper and a lower band of $0 initially, such that the \nsecurity would not launch unless the calculated price equaled the \nExpected Price. If the security did not pass the validation check, \nhowever, the DLP could subsequently choose to widen the price bands to \nallow the Initial ETP Open to proceed at a price that might vary from \nthe Expected Price. Such price deviations are possible because market \nparticipants may continue to enter and cancel orders during the period \nbetween the display of the Expected Price to the DLP and the \ncommencement of Nasdaq Halt Cross. Nasdaq may determine at any point \nduring the cross auction process up through the conclusion of the Pre-\nLaunch Period to postpone and reschedule the Initial ETP Open.\\36\\ \nMarket participants may continue to enter orders and order \ncancellations for participation in the cross auction during the Pre-\nLaunch Period up to the point that the cross auction process \ncommences.\\37\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\36\\ See proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(B), which is similar to Rule \n4120(c)(8)(A), except the Exchange is not adopting language that \nprovides that it would consult with the underwriter to postpone and \nreschedule the IPO. This language is designed to allow IPOs to be \npostponed and rescheduled because the underwriter, for example, did \nnot think the corporate security was ready to trade, or Nasdaq had \nto postpone and reschedule the IPO due to a market event or system \ndisruption. As discussed above, the Exchange is proposing to open \nthe ETP at 9:45 a.m. ET at the latest, even if the DLP does not \nindicate that the ETP is ready to trade. However, the Exchange would \nlike to retain the ability to postpone and reschedule the proposed \nInitial ETP Launch in the event of a serious market event or system \ndisruption.\n    \\37\\ See proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(B), which is similar to Rule \n4120(c)(8)(A).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange notes that the DLP's involvement in timing the \ncommencement of trading in the ETP is consistent with the underwriter's \ninvolvement in the existing IPO opening process. Similar to the \nunderwriter in an IPO, the Exchange believes that the DLP, with their \nmarket knowledge of the book and an understanding of the security, \nwould be well placed to notify Nasdaq when the ETP should be released \nfor trading and approve Nasdaq proceeding with the price validation \nchecks after the DLP receives the Expected Price.\n    Accordingly, the Exchange believes it is in the best interest of \nthe market to give DLPs input into the timing of when to proceed with \nopening the ETP via the Nasdaq Halt Cross to help ensure the fair and \norderly launch of trading in the ETP. The proposed language allowing \nthe DLP to postpone and reschedule the Initial ETP Open with the \nconcurrence of Nasdaq is designed to allow flexibility if unforeseen \nmarket or system events make it inadvisable to proceed with the Initial \nETP Open.\n    The Exchange is also proposing to update Rule 4753(b) to include \nproposed Rule 4120(a)(15) in the list of enumerated provisions that \nwould be subject to the Nasdaq Halt Cross. As such, any ETP that is \nsubject to the Initial ETP Open will be opened using the Nasdaq Halt \nCross for trading during Market Hours.\n    Lastly, the Exchange proposes to amend Equity 7, Section 115, which \nsets forth pricing for various Nasdaq services such as the Nasdaq IPO \nWorkstation. Today, the Nasdaq IPO Workstation provides subscribing \nmember firms with access to the IPO Indicator service, which provides \ninformation on orders that would be received in an IPO during the \nlaunch process. This tool assists subscribing member firms in \nmonitoring their orders in the Nasdaq Halt Cross leading up to the \nlaunch of an IPO.\\38\\ The IPO Indicator provides the same information \nin the Order Imbalance Indicator \\39\\ together with information about \nthe subscribing member firms on Nasdaq in the IPO security. The IPO \nIndicator allows the subscriber to select an IPO security by ticker and \nsee the Current Reference Price, the number of paired shares, and the \nnumber of imbalance shares during the Display Only and Pre-Launch \nPeriods. The subscriber can also see the total number of IPO shares the \nmember firm has entered for execution in the IPO Halt Cross, the nature \nof such shares (buy or sell), and the number of IPO shares that would \nbe executed in the Nasdaq Halt Cross at that time for each of those \ncategories. A subscriber can also access further detail on its IPO \nshares\n\n[[Page 22429]]\n\npresented by individual order or order block, which will include the \nnumber of IPO shares in a particular order or order block, the number \nand percentage of IPO shares of the order or order block that would be \nexecuted in the Nasdaq Halt Cross if it occurred at any given time in \nthe process, based on the Order Imbalance Indicator disseminated every \nsecond, and the price at which the order or order block was submitted. \nAs such, the IPO Indicator provides member firms with information \nconsistent with what Nasdaq currently disseminates during the IPO \nopening process, but as it relates to the member firm's orders and in \ngreater detail.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\38\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 74041 (January 13, \n2015), 80 FR 2762 (January 20, 2015) (SR-NASDAQ-2014-110) (Order \nApproving a Proposed Rule Change to Offer the New IPO Workstation).\n    \\39\\ See supra note 10.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange now proposes to offer this tool to subscribing member \nDLPs and non-member ETP issuers so that they may receive similar \ninformation described above for the ETP securities subject to the \nInitial ETP Open.\\40\\ Today, member firms may subscribe to the Nasdaq \nIPO workstation at no cost.\\41\\ DLPs are member firms, so they would \nalso be able to subscribe to the Nasdaq IPO workstation at no cost to \naccess the IPO Indicator under this proposal. The Exchange proposes in \nnew paragraph (k) to Equity 7, Section 115 that an ETP issuer may \nlikewise subscribe to the IPO Workstation at no cost so that they may \nreceive similar information on orders in the proposed Initial ETP Open. \nThis information will be the same information that is in the Order \nImbalance Indicator.\\42\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\40\\ The DLP and ETP issuer would receive the information \ndescribed above for the IPO Indicator on a consolidated basis and \nnot on an individual member firm's order basis.\n    \\41\\ See Equity 7, Section 115(i).\n    \\42\\ See supra note 10.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImplementation\n    To implement this proposal, Nasdaq will release an Equity Trader \nAlert no later than the second quarter of 2025 announcing the \nimplementation date.\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section \n6(b) of the Act,\\43\\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Section \n6(b)(5) of the Act,\\44\\ in particular, in that it is designed to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments \nto and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national \nmarket system, and, in general to protect investors and the public \ninterest. The proposed rule change aims to protect investors and the \npublic interest by strengthening safeguards against unexpected \nvolatility in the pricing of ETPs on their launch day.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\43\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\44\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The proposed rule change achieves these goals by offering an \noptional new issuer halt that enhances the price discovery process for \nETPs on their initial day of trading. This function is similar to the \nIPO opening process in Rules 4120(a)(7), 4120(c)(8), and 4753, which \nhas proven effective in managing price discovery for newly listed \nsecurities. While the IPO opening process currently provides protection \nby ensuring the final price does not deviate from recent indicative \nprices beyond set price band thresholds (such a $0.50 change), similar \nsafeguards are required to ensure stability and investor confidence in \nETP pricing upon launch.\n    The Exchange believes that its proposal to offer optional \nfunctionality to permit ETP issuers the ability to open on launch day \nby entering into a new issuer halt would maximize the chances of more \nefficient price discovery and remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, \nin general, protect investors because the initial sale price would be \nbased on market interest and the matching of buy and sell orders in an \nauction would be open to all market participants. Today, the ETP would \nsimply open for trading at 4:00 a.m. ET during Pre-Market Hours at an \ninitial price that is based on the ETP's Net Asset Value, as provided \nby the ETP issuer to Nasdaq. Accordingly, the Exchange believes that \nthe proposed process would provide safeguards for the opening price of \nthe ETP that is based on additional market information thereby \nprotecting investors and the public interest.\n    Although the Exchange is providing ETP issuers the discretion to \nelect either the current process or the new proposed process, the \nExchange believes that each price discovery process is designed to \narrive at an opening price that represents the price for the underlying \nETP. In particular, Nasdaq believes that the change will facilitate the \ncommencement of orderly trading in ETPs on their first day of trading, \nby providing the DLP with flexibility throughout the initial launch \nprocess to allow order entry and the development of price stability \nprior to opening. The Exchange believes that the DLP's involvement in \ntiming the commencement of trading in the ETP, as described above, is \nconsistent with the Act as this will promote the fair and orderly \nlaunch of trading in the ETP. The Exchange believes that the DLP, with \ntheir market knowledge of the book and an understanding of the \nsecurity, would be well placed to notify Nasdaq when the ETP should be \nreleased for trading and approve Nasdaq proceeding with the price \nvalidation checks after the DLP receives the Expected Price.\n    The Exchange also believes that it is reasonable and appropriate to \nuse the Nasdaq Halt Cross process under Rule 4753 to open trading in \nthe ETP (upon passing the validation checks) because it is consistent \nwith the process that is used by Nasdaq when opening an IPO security. \nIt will ensure that the process for resuming trading following the \nInitial ETP Launch is consistent with other types of halts initiated by \nNasdaq, including the IPO halt. The Exchange also believes that it is \nreasonable, equitable and not unfairly discriminatory to offer the IPO \nWorkstation to all subscribing DLP member firms and non-member ETP \nissuers at no cost because they will be provided with more information \nregarding orders submitted for participation in the Initial ETP Open, \nsimilar to the IPO process as discussed above. Both the DLP and ETP \nissuer would be able to subscribe for this tool for the Initial ETP \nOpen at no cost, just as all subscribing member firms do today for \nIPOs.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in \nfurtherance of the purposes of the Act. Specifically, the change will \nnot affect the ability of market participants to participate fully in \nan ETP's launch day because it is an optional functionality that \npermits ETPs to enter into a new issuer halt on its launch day, for a \nspecified time period, and then manually open. Rather, the change is \ndesigned to promote stability and reduce volatility in the pricing of \nthe ETP on its launch day, and therefore does not impose any \nrestriction on competition. In particular, the Exchange believes that \nthe optional initial launch process will enhance the competitiveness of \nits process for initial pricing of ETPs without imposing any burdens on \nthe ability of DLP or other market participants to participate in that \nprocess.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were either solicited or received.\n\n[[Page 22430]]\n\nIII. Discussion and Commission Findings\n\n    After careful review, the Commission finds that the proposed rule \nchange, as modified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with the Act and \nrules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities \nexchange.\\45\\ In particular, the Commission finds that the proposed \nrule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with Section \n6(b)(5) of the Act,\\46\\ which requires, among other things, that the \nExchange's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative \nacts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, \nto remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open \nmarket and a national market system, and, in general, to protect \ninvestors and the public interest.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\45\\ In approving this proposed rule change, the Commission has \nconsidered the proposed rule's impact on efficiency, competition, \nand capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).\n    \\46\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange states that its proposal to permit ETP issuers to \nbegin trading on launch day by conducting an auction at the beginning \nof regular trading hours would maximize the chances of more efficient \nprice discovery and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of \na free and open market and a national market system and, in general, \nprotect investors because the initial sale price would be based on \nmarket interest and the matching of buy and sell orders in an auction \nthat would be open to all market participants. The Exchange states the \nproposed process would protect investors and the public interest by \nproviding safeguards for the opening price of the ETP based on \nadditional market information, as opposed to the current process in \nwhich the ETP would open for trading at 4:00 a.m. ET during Pre-Market \nHours at an initial price informed by the ETP's Net Asset Value as \nprovided by the ETP to the Exchange.\n    Further, the Exchange represents that the proposed Initial ETP Open \nprocess is similar to the IPO opening process, which has ``proven \neffective in managing price discovery for newly listed securities.'' \n\\47\\ Unlike the IPO opening process, (1) the Initial ETP Open would \nprovide that a DLP, instead of an underwriter, select price bands to \nensure that the actual calculated price at which the Nasdaq Halt Cross \nwould occur does not deviate from the Expected Price by more than the \nselected price band amounts and (2) the ETP would be submitted for \nvalidation checks at 9:45 a.m. ET at the latest without exception, \nwhereas under the existing IPO process underwriter approval is required \nprior to the Exchange submitting the IPO security for validation \nchecks. The Exchange's proposal to provide an alternative opening \nprocess for ETPs on the first day of trading modeled on the IPO opening \nprocess could benefit investors by enhancing the price discovery \nprocess for ETPs on their initial day of trading, and the role of the \nDLP could be an additional safeguard against unexpected volatility in \nthe pricing of the ETP.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\47\\ See Amendment No. 1 at 19.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Finally, the Exchange's proposal to offer the IPO Workstation to \nall subscribing DLP member firms and non-member ETP issuers at no cost, \nas is done for all subscribing member firms for IPOs, will promote just \nand equitable principles of trade. Access to the IPO Workstation will \nprovide the DLP and ETP Issuer with information regarding orders \nsubmitted for participation in the Initial ETP Open. The Exchange \nrepresents that the information made available through the IPO \nWorkstation will be the same information that is in the Order Imbalance \nIndicator.\\48\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\48\\ See page 17.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed \nrule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with Section \n6(b)(5) of the Act \\49\\ and the rules and regulations thereunder \napplicable to a national securities exchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\49\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV. Solicitation of Comments on Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule \nChange\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and \narguments concerning whether Amendment No. 1 is consistent with the \nAct.

The Commission will post all comments on \nthe Commission's internet website (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml\">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml</a>). Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all \nwritten statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are \nfiled with the Commission, and all written communications relating to \nthe proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other \nthan those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the \nprovisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for website viewing and \nprinting in the Commission's Public Reference Room, 100 F Street NE, \nWashington, DC 20549, on official business days between the hours of 10 \na.m. and 3 p.m. Copies of the filing also will be available for \ninspection and copying at the principal office of the Exchange. Do not \ninclude personal identifiable information in submissions; you should \nsubmit only information that you wish to make available publicly.

Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by \nAmendment No. 1\n\n    The Commission finds good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of \nthe Act,\\50\\ to approve the proposed rule change, as modified by \nAmendment No. 1, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of \npublication of notice of Amendment No. 1 in the Federal Register. As \ndescribed in greater detail above, in Amendment No. 1, the Exchange: \n(1) provided additional background on how an ETP opens today and \nrationale on why the Exchange is proposing the Initial ETP Open; (2) \nspecified that the Exchange would only assign one DLP per ETP in the \ncontext of the proposed Initial ETP Open; (3) deleted the Regulation M \nstatement relating to the DLP in proposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(A) because \nthe Exchange inadvertently included this statement when it does not \napply in the context of this proposal; (4) added more granularity in \nproposed Rule 4120(c)(11)(B)(i) about the DLP notifying the Exchange \nthat the ETP is ready to trade; (5) clarified that price bands would be \nset exchange-wide and not on a security-by-security basis;\n\n[[Page 22431]]\n\n(6) specified the DLP's responsibilities in the proposed Initial ETP \nOpen; and (7) clarified that the IPO Indicator will provide the same \ninformation in the Order Imbalance Indicator under this proposal. The \nchanges and clarifications in Amendment No. 1 assist the Commission in \nevaluating the Exchange's proposal and do not materially change the \nterms of the Exchange's original proposal. Accordingly, the Commission \nfinds good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\\51\\ to \napprove the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1 on an \naccelerated basis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\50\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).\n    \\51\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\n    It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the \nAct,\\52\\ that the proposed rule change (SR-NASDAQ-2025-011), as \nmodified by Amendment No. 1, be, and it hereby is, approved on an \naccelerated basis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\52\\ Id.\n\n    For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, \npursuant to delegated authority.\\53\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\53\\ 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSherry R.

(the ``Exchange'' or ``Cboe \nOptions'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \n``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, \nand III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The \nCommission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the \nproposed rule change from interested persons.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).\n    \\2\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or ``Cboe Options'') proposes \nto amend fees related to the Cboe Legacy Silexx platform versions. The \ntext of the proposed rule change is provided in Exhibit 5.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the \nExchange's website (<a href=\"http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/CBOELegalRegulatoryHome.aspx\">http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/CBOELegalRegulatoryHome.aspx</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the \nSecretary, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend fees related to the Cboe Legacy \nSilexx platform versions (collectively, the ``Legacy Platforms'' as \nfurther described herein) and to extend the time of a fee waiver \ncurrently offered for Cboe Silexx, effective May 1, 2025.\\3\\ By way of \nbackground, the Exchange offers several versions of its Silexx \nplatform. Originally, the Exchange offered the following versions of \nthe Silexx platform: Basic, Pro, Pro Plus Risk and Buy-Side Manager \n(``Legacy Platforms''). The Legacy Platforms are designed so that a \nUser may enter orders into the platform to send to the executing \nbroker, including TPHs, of its choice with connectivity to the \nplatform. The executing broker can then send orders to Cboe Options (if \nthe broker-dealer is a Trading Permit Holder (``TPH'')) or other U.S. \nexchanges (and trading centers) in accordance with the User's \ninstructions. Users cannot directly route orders through any of the \nLegacy Platforms to an exchange or trading center nor is the platform \nintegrated into or directly connected to Cboe Option's System. In 2019, \nthe Exchange made available a new version of the Silexx\n\n[[Page 22432]]\n\nplatform, Silexx FLEX, which supports the trading of FLEX Options and \nallows authorized Users with direct access to the Exchange to establish \nconnectivity and submit orders directly to the Exchange.\\4\\ In 2020, \nthe Exchange made an additional version of the Silexx platform \navailable, Cboe Silexx, which supports the trading of non-FLEX Options \nand allows authorized Users with direct access to the Exchange to \nestablish connectivity and submit orders directly to the Exchange.\\5\\ \nCboe Silexx is essentially the same platform as Silexx FLEX, with the \nsame applicable functionality, except that it additionally supports \nnon-FLEX trading. As noted in previous filings, the Exchange is in the \nprocess of transitioning the Legacy Platforms to the current version of \nCboe Silexx and Silexx FLEX.\\6\\ As the Exchange is actively \ntransitioning away from the Legacy Platforms, and in the meantime is \nexpending time and resources to maintain both platforms, the Exchange \npreviously proposed to increase the fees for the Legacy Platforms.\\7\\ \nFor this same reason, the Exchange now proposes to increase the API fee \nfor the Legacy Platforms from a $200/month/login ID fee to $2,000/\nmonth/login ID for logins 1-5 and a fee of $0/month/login ID for logins \n6-10 for a firm and shall be capped at 10 login IDs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ The Exchange initially submitted the proposed rule change on \nMay 1, 2025 (SR-CBOE-2025-032). On May 12, 2025, the Exchange \nwithdrew that filing and submitted this filing.\n    \\4\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 87028 (September 19, \n2019) 84 FR 50529 (September 25, 2019) (SR-CBOE-2019-061). Only \nUsers authorized for direct access and who are approved to trade \nFLEX Options may trade FLEX Options via Cboe Silexx. Only authorized \nUsers and associated persons of Users may establish connectivity to \nand directly access the Exchange, pursuant to Rule 5.5 and the \nExchange's technical specifications.\n    \\5\\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 88741 (April 24, \n2020) 85 FR 24045 (April 30, 2020) (SR-CBOE-2020-040). Only \nauthorized Users and associated persons of Users may establish \nconnectivity to and directly access the Exchange, pursuant to Rule \n5.5 and the Exchange's technical specifications.\n    \\6\\ See Securities Exchange Release No. 98722 (October 11, 2023) \n88 FR 71619 (October 17, 2023) (SR-CBOE-2023-060). Only authorized \nUsers and associated persons of Users will continue to be able to \nestablish connectivity to and directly access the Exchange, pursuant \nto Rule 5.5 and the Exchange's technical specifications. \nUnauthorized Users will not be able to connect directly to the \nExchange. The new Cboe Silexx platform will function in the same \nmanner as the Legacy Platforms versions currently available to \nUsers: it will be completely voluntary; orders entered through the \nplatform will receive no preferential treatment as compared to \norders electronically sent to Cboe Options in any other manner; \norders entered through the platform will be subject to current \ntrading rules in the same manner as all other orders sent to the \nExchange, which is the same as orders that are sent through the \nExchange's System today; the Exchange's System will not distinguish \nbetween orders sent from Silexx and orders sent in any other manner; \nand Silexx will provide technical support, maintenance and user \ntraining for the new platform version upon the same terms and \nconditions for all Users. The Exchange plans to decommission the \nLegacy Platforms at a future to-be-determined date, at which time \nthe Legacy Platforms will be unavailable to users.\n    \\7\\ See Securities Exchange Release No. 102185 (January 14, \n2025) 90 FR 7200 (January 21, 2025) (SR-CBOE-2025-001); Securities \nExchange Release No. 102398 (February 11, 2025) 90 FR 9781 (February \n18, 2025) (SR-CBOE-2025-005); and Securities Exchange Release No. \n102724 (March 13, 2025) 90 FR 14288 (March 31, 2025) (SR-CBOE-2025-\n016).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange previously introduced a fee waiver of two months to \nallow users of Cboe Silexx to transition to the new version of the \nplatform without incurring duplicative Login ID and Market Data Feed \nfees for access to both the old and new versions of Cboe Silexx during \nthis transitional period.\\8\\ The Exchange further noted that it \nbelieved not assessing duplicative fees for Users transitioning to Cboe \nSilexx would serve as an incentive to market participants to start \nusing the Cboe Silexx platform, while also providing time and \nflexibility for such Users to become familiar with and fully acclimated \nto the new platform.\\9\\ For this same reason, the Exchange now proposes \nto extend the existing fee waiver for Cboe Silexx Login ID fees that \nare incurred during the migration from a period of two months to three \nmonths, which does not need to be consecutive.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ See supra[sic] note 13.\n    \\9\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and \nregulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, \nthe requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\\10\\ Specifically, the \nExchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\11\\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be \ndesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation \nand coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, \nsettling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating \ntransactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, \nin general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, \nthe Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the \nSection 6(b)(5) \\12\\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be \ndesigned to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, \nbrokers, or dealers. Additionally, the Exchange also believes the \nproposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act, \nwhich requires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation \nof reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its TPHs and other \npersons using its facilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\11\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n    \\12\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In particular, the Exchange also believes the proposed fee increase \nfor the API for the Legacy Platforms is reasonable, equitable, and not \nunfairly discriminatory because the fee will apply to all users of the \nLegacy Platforms who utilize the API. Additionally, the Exchange \nbelieves the proposed fee is reasonable as it accounts for \nadministrative costs that Cboe Silexx is incurring, but not charging \nusers, to maintain support for Legacy Platforms while Cboe Silexx \ntransitions away from the Legacy Platforms. As noted earlier, the \nExchange is in the process of transitioning the Legacy Platforms to the \ncurrent version of Cboe Silexx and Silexx FLEX. The Exchange believes \nthat increasing the API fee for the Legacy Platforms also serves as an \nincentive to market participants to transition to the current version \nof Cboe Silexx from the Legacy Platforms.\\13\\ Further, the Exchange \nnotes that the proposed, new fee structure for the API for the Legacy \nPlatforms maxes out at a monthly fee of $10,000. While the Exchange \nwould like to incentivize market participants to transition to the \ncurrent version of Cboe Silexx, it does not want the increase in the \nAPI fee to be overly prohibitive for firms that may have a larger \nnumber of users that they are working to transition. The Exchange also \nbelieves that capping the number of API Login IDs a firm may utilize \nwill further incentivize market participants to transition to the \ncurrent version of Cboe Silexx. The Exchange reiterates that the \nSilexx, including the Legacy Platforms and Cboe Silexx, is entirely \noptional for participants and such connectivity is not required to \naccess the Exchange. Of further note, the API feature is an additional \noptional feature on top of the optional connectivity the Exchange \noffers to connect. For the above reasons, the Exchange believes that \nproposed fee increase is reasonable,\n\n[[Page 22433]]\n\nequitable, and not unfairly discriminatory.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ The Exchange has previously introduced incentives to assist \nin the migration from the Legacy Platforms to the current version of \nCboe Silexx and Silexx Flex by introducing a Data Management fee for \nusers of Legacy Platforms and waiving duplicative Login ID and \nMarket Data Feed fees for Cboe Silexx during a user's transition \nperiod. See Securities Exchange Release No. 99111 (December 7, 2023) \n88 FR 86411 (December 13, 2023) (SR-CBOE-2023-064) and Securities \nExchange Release No. 98722 (October 11, 2023) 88 FR 71619 (October \n17, 2023) (SR-CBOE-2023-060).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Next, the Exchange believes that increasing the time permitted for \nwaivers is also reasonable, equitable and not unfairly discriminatory \nbecause the waiver applies to users who are already subject to a \nmonthly Login ID fee (albeit for the Legacy Platform), as well as \nMarket Data Feed fees (for those receiving it on the Legacy Platform). \nAdditionally, the fee waiver period will be limited to the timeframe \nduring which such Users have access to the old and new version of Cboe \nSilexx and would otherwise result in duplicative fees. The Exchange \nfurther believes a fee waiver of three months is an appropriate and \nreasonable amount of time for Users to become familiar with and fully \nacclimated to the new platform and therefore able to terminate their \nconnection to the Legacy Platforms. The Exchange notes that a timeline \nof three months is more fitting now, as many of the users who are some \nof the final users to transition from the Legacy Platforms may have \nmore nuanced issues to address while they are migrating to Cboe Silexx.\n    Finally, the Exchange notes that use of the platform is \ndiscretionary and not compulsory, as users can choose to route orders, \nincluding to Cboe Options, without the use of the platform. Indeed, the \nLegacy Platforms are not an exclusive means of trading, and if market \nparticipants believe that other products, vendors, front-end builds, \netc. available in the marketplace are more beneficial or cost effective \nthan the Legacy Platforms (or the current version of Cboe Silexx and \nSilexx FLEX), they may simply use those products instead, including for \nrouting orders to the Exchange (indirectly or directly if they are \nauthorized Users). The Exchange makes the platform available as a \nconvenience to market participants, who will continue to have the \noption to use any order entry and management system available in the \nmarketplace to send orders to the Exchange and other exchanges; the \nplatform is merely an alternative offered by the Exchange.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed change will not \nimpose any burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary or \nappropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because the \nproposed rule change will apply to similarly situated participants \nuniformly, as described in detail above.\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule changes will \nimpose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or \nappropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because the \nproposed change applies only to Cboe Options. Additionally, the Legacy \nPlatforms are similar to types of products that are widely available \nthroughout the industry, including from some exchanges and the current \nversion of Cboe Silexx and Silexx FLEX, at similar prices. Further, the \nproposed rule change relates to (i) an optional feature on an optional \nplatform as it pertains to the proposed fee increase for the API for \nLegacy Platforms and (ii) further assisting participants in their \nmigration efforts by waiving the Cboe Silexx Login ID fees for an \nadditional month for this optional platform. As discussed, the use of \nthe platform continues to be completely voluntary and market \nparticipants will continue to have the flexibility to use any entry and \nmanagement tool that is proprietary or from third-party vendors, and/or \nmarket participants may choose any executing brokers to enter their \norders. The Legacy Platforms are not an exclusive means of trading, and \nif market participants believe that other products, vendors, front-end \nbuilds, etc. available in the marketplace are more beneficial than the \nLegacy Platforms (or the current version of Cboe Silexx and Silexx \nFLEX), they may simply use those products instead, including for \nrouting orders to the Exchange (indirectly or directly if they are \nauthorized Users). Use of the functionality is completely voluntary.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the \nproposed rule change.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section \n19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \\14\\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \\15\\ \nthereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed \nrule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule \nchange if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or \notherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission \ntakes such action, the Commission will institute proceedings to \ndetermine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or \ndisapproved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).\n    \\15\\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.

Institution of proceedings is appropriate at this time in \nview of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change. \nInstitution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has \nreached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. \nRather, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to \nprovide comments on the proposed rule change.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,\\15\\ the Commission is \nproviding notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. \nThe Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional \nanalysis of the proposed rule change's consistency with Section 6(b)(5) \nof the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a \nnational securities exchange be ``designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices'' and ``to protect investors and the \npublic interest.'' \\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ Id.\n    \\16\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the \nExchange's statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth \nin the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to \nsubmit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission \nseeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the \nTrust, which would hold XRP, is designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not \npreviously contemplated by the Commission.\n\nIV. Procedure: Request for Written Comments\n\n    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written \nsubmissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the \nissues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have \nwith the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written \nviews of interested persons concerning whether the proposal, as \nmodified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) or any \nother provision of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. \nAlthough there do not appear to be any issues relevant to approval or \ndisapproval that would be facilitated by an oral presentation of views, \ndata, and arguments, the Commission will consider, pursuant to Rule \n19b-4, any request for an opportunity to make an oral presentation.\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the Securities \nActs Amendments of 1975, Public Law 94-29 (June 4, 1975), grants the \nCommission flexibility to determine what type of proceeding--either \noral or notice and opportunity for written comments--is appropriate \nfor consideration of a particular proposal by a self-regulatory \norganization.

For \nadditional information, the applicable system of records notice (SORN), \nDOT/ALL-14, 73 FR 3316 (Jan. 17, 2008), can be reviewed at <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2008-01-17/pdf/E8-785.pdf\">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2008-01-17/pdf/E8-785.pdf</a>.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\n    On July 24, 2023, the FAA published a proposed rule titled \n``Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certification'' (MOSAIC) in \nthe Federal Register to amend regulations for the manufacture, \ncertification, operation, maintenance, and alteration of light-sport \ncategory aircraft, and other amendments (88 FR 47650, Docket No. FAA-\n2023-1377).\n    The Draft Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA) analyzes and \ndiscloses the potential environmental impacts associated with \nimplementation of the MOSAIC rule, pursuant to the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA). A categorical exclusion was applied to \nFAA's action to issue the proposed rule and provide notice in the \nFederal Register (88 FR 47722).\n    The MOSAIC rule would establish requirements for aircraft, other \nthan unmanned aircraft, that hold special airworthiness certificates, \nairmen that operate and maintain those aircraft, and supporting rules. \nThe rule would enable the FAA to certificate light-sport category \naircraft, sport pilots, and light-sport repairmen at the appropriate \nlevel of rigor and privilege. The rule aims to increase the \navailability of safe, modern, and affordable aircraft for recreational \naviation, flight training, and certain aerial work.\n    Under the proposed action, manufacturers of light-sport aircraft \nmay design and manufacture a broader array of aircraft including \nadditional classes of aircraft such as rotorcraft and powered-lift, and \naircraft with increased seating, without weight limits, higher speeds, \nnew types of propulsion systems, new propeller types, retractable \nlanding gear, and aircraft with simplified flight controls. Sport pilot \nprivileges would be expanded to include a broader array of aircraft and \nadd new privileges. New privileges for sport pilots would include \noperating helicopters, operating at night, operating aircraft with \nretractable landing gear, operating aircraft with constant speed \npropellers, and operating high-performance airplanes. These new \nprivileges would be available via training and endorsements. Repairman \n(light-sport) certificate privileges also would be expanded to allow \nwork on all aircraft in the expanded categories of light-sport \naircraft.\n    The proposed action would revise operating limitations for \nrestricted category aircraft, experimental aircraft, and light-sport \ncategory aircraft. The rule would also codify a Congressional mandate \nto enable certain aircraft with an experimental airworthiness \ncertificate to operate commercially as space support vehicles without \nan air carrier certificate or exemption. The rule would establish a new \npurpose for issuance of an experimental\n\n[[Page 22438]]\n\nairworthiness certificate to former military aircraft to improve \nalignment between certain operations of former military aircraft and \nthe experimental airworthiness certificates which authorize their \noperation. The rule would also increase the duration of certain \nexperimental airworthiness certificates from one to three years. \nAdditionally, except for non-powered aircraft, agricultural aircraft, \nand fire-fighting aircraft, the proposed rule would expand the \napplicability of noise requirements under part 36 of title 14 of the \nCode of Federal Regulations to new light-sport aircraft and certain \nalterations that increase noise in used light-sport aircraft and \ncertain used experimental light-sport category aircraft. The rule would \nallow options for compliance: conventional noise testing per part 36 or \na means of compliance specified in FAA-approved, industry consensus \nstandards.\n    The environmental impacts of implementing these proposed MOSAIC \nrule changes have been considered in a manner consistent with the \nprovisions of NEPA, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and FAA Order \n1050.1F, Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures.\n    Based on the analysis provided in the Draft PEA, the FAA has \npreliminarily determined in a proposed finding of no significant impact \nthat there will not be a significant impact to the human environment. \nAs a result, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has not been \ninitiated. 42 U.S.C. 4336e(7). The FAA intends for this PEA to create \nefficiencies by establishing a framework that can be used for \n``tiering,'' where appropriate, to future FAA actions that require \nadditional analysis beyond the scope of this PEA. As decisions on \nfuture FAA actions are made, to the extent additional NEPA analysis is \nrequired, environmental review will be conducted to supplement the \nanalysis set forth in this PEA.\n    The Draft PEA is available for review online at the following link: \n<a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FAA-2023-1377/document\">https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FAA-2023-1377/document</a>.\n\nComments Invited\n\n    The FAA invites interested stakeholders to submit comments on the \nDraft PEA, as specified in the ADDRESSES section of this Notice. \nCommenters should include the subject line, ``Public Comment on Draft \nMOSAIC PEA'' on all comments submitted to the FAA. All comments must be \nprovided in English.\n    The FAA will accept comments in Word, PDF, or email body. No \nbusiness proprietary information, copyrighted information, or \npersonally identifiable information should be submitted in response to \nthis request. Please be aware that comments submitted may be posted on \na Federal website or otherwise released publicly.\n    The most helpful comments reference a specific recommendation, \nexplain the reason for any recommended change, and include supporting \ninformation. The FAA will consider all comments received on or before \nthe closing date. The FAA will also consider late filed comments if it \nis possible to do so without incurring expense or delay.\n\n    Issued in Washington, DC.\nBrian Cable,\nManager, Organization and System Policy Branch, Policy and Standards \nDivision, Aircraft Certification Service.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09456 Filed 5-23-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4910-13-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

The estimated total \ncost is $1.69 billion.\n    This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and \nnational security objectives of the U.S. by improving the security of a \nNATO Ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress \nin Europe.\n    The proposed sale will improve Poland's capability to meet current \nand future threats by ensuring it has modern, capable air-to-air \nmunitions. This sale will further advance the already high level of \nPolish Air Force interoperability with U.S. Joint Forces and other \nregional and NATO forces. The Government of Poland already has AMRAAMs \nin its inventory and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles \nand services into its armed forces.\n    The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the \nbasic military balance in the region.\n    The principal contractor will be RTX Corporation, Tucson, AZ. There \nare no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this \npotential sale.\n    Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the \nassignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor \nrepresentatives to the Government of Poland.\n    There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a \nresult of this proposed sale.\nTransmittal No. 24-29\nNotice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section \n36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act\nAnnex\nItem No. vii\n    (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:\n    1. The AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) \nis a supersonic, air-launched, aerial intercept guided missile \nfeaturing digital technology and micro-miniature, solid-state \nelectronics. AMRAAM capabilities include look-down and shoot-down, \nmultiple launches against multiple targets, resistance to electronic \ncountermeasures, and interception of high and low-flying and \nmaneuvering targets. This potential sale will include Captive Air \nTraining Missiles, AMRAAM guidance section spares and control section \nspares, and LAU-129 guided missile launchers.\n    2. The Common Munitions Built-In-Test (BIT)/Reprogramming Equipment \n(CMBRE) is supporting equipment used to interface with weapon systems \nto initiate and report BIT results and to upload and download flight \nsoftware. CMBRE supports multiple munitions platforms with a range of \napplications that perform preflight checks, periodic maintenance \nchecks, loading of Operational Flight Program data, loading of \nmunitions mission planning data, loading of Global Positioning System \n(GPS) cryptographic keys, and declassification of munitions memory.\n    3. The ADU-891 Adapter Group Test Set provides the physical and \nelectrical interface between the CMBRE and the missile.\n    4. The highest level of classification of defense articles, \ncomponents, and services included in this potential sale is SECRET.\n    5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge \nof the specific hardware and software elements, the information could \nbe used to develop countermeasures that might reduce weapon system \neffectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or \nadvanced capabilities.\n    6. A determination has been made that Poland can provide \nsubstantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive \ntechnology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale is \nnecessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national \nsecurity objectives outlined in the Policy Justification.\n    7. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal \nhave been authorized for release and export to Poland.\n\n[FR Doc. 2025-09346 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6001-FR-C\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Bulletin Number 328 lists \ncurrent per diem rates prescribed for reimbursement of subsistence \nexpenses while on official Government travel to Alaska, Hawaii, the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the possessions of the United States. \nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 lodging rate review for Guam, American Samoa, \nMidway Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and Wake Island resulted in \nrate changes for multiple locations. The meal rate for Wake Island was \nalso updated during this review.\n\nDATES: The updated rates take effect March 1, 2025.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John Kenney, 571-372-1300, \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#167c797e783866387d737878736f38757f60567b777f7a387b7f7a\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"90fafff8febee0befbf5fefef5e9bef3f9e6d0fdf1f9fcbefdf9fc\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This document notifies the public of \nrevisions in per diem rates prescribed by the Per Diem, Travel, and \nTransportation Allowance Committee for travel to non-foreign areas \noutside the continental United States. The FY 2025 lodging rate review \nfor Guam, American Samoa, Midway Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and \nWake Island resulted in lodging rate increases for three locations. The \nreview also resulted in a meal rate increase for Wake Island. Bulletin \nNumber 328 is published in the Federal Register to ensure that \nGovernment travelers\n\n[[Page 22078]]\n\noutside the DoD are notified of revisions to the current reimbursement \nrates.\n    If you believe the lodging, meal or incidental allowance rate for a \nlocality listed in the following table is insufficient, you may request \na rate review for that location.

EIIC provides technical support to states and \njurisdictions to achieve the EMSC program's mandate by increasing \npediatric readiness in hospital EDs and prehospital EMS agencies to \nimprove outcomes for children. EIIC supports demonstration projects to \nimplement evidence-based clinical guidelines and establish evidence-\nbased training for emergency care practitioners in hospital EDs and \nprehospital EMS agencies in underserved communities. EIIC was \nestablished in 2016 through a 4-year cooperative agreement. HRSA's \nMaternal and Child Health Bureau re-competed the program in 2020 for \nanother 4 years and extended the program for an additional year in \nfiscal year 2024 to support the first comprehensive national assessment \nof prehospital agencies and continue quality improvement activities to \nincrease pediatric readiness. The current budget period ends on June \n30, 2025. Renewal of this grant will allow EIIC to continue to advance \npediatric readiness nationally during this upcoming extension period in \nboth prehospital EMS and hospital emergency departments through the \ndissemination of data. HRSA intends to recompete this program prior to \nthe end of the 12-month extension period. HRSA will award $2,500,000 to \nthe existing EIIC Program award recipient to continue operations as \noutlined in HRSA-20-037 Notice of Funding Opportunity.\n\nThomas J.

While the \nSecretary of HHS is named as the respondent in all proceedings brought \nby the filing of petitions for compensation under the Program, the \nUnited States Court of Federal Claims is charged by statute with \nresponsibility for considering and acting upon the petitions.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  For information about requirements \nfor filing petitions, and the Program in general, contact Lisa L. \nReyes, Clerk of Court, United States Court of Federal Claims, 717 \nMadison Place NW, Washington, DC 20005, (202) 357-6400. For information \non HRSA's role in the Program, contact the Director, Division of Injury \nCompensation Programs, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 8W-25A, Rockville, \nMaryland 20857; 1-800-338-2382, or visit our website at: <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation\">https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation</a>.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Program provides a system of no-fault \ncompensation for certain individuals who have been injured by specified \nchildhood vaccines. Subtitle 2 of Title XXI of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. \n300aa-10 et seq., provides that those seeking compensation are to file \na petition with the United States Court of Federal Claims and to serve \na copy of the petition to the Secretary of HHS, who is named as the \nrespondent in each proceeding. The Secretary has delegated this \nresponsibility under the Program to HRSA. The Court is directed by \nstatute to appoint special masters who take evidence, conduct hearings \nas appropriate, and make initial decisions as to eligibility for, and \namount of, compensation.\n    A petition may be filed with respect to injuries, disabilities, \nillnesses, conditions, and deaths resulting from vaccines described in \nthe Vaccine Injury Table (the Table) set forth at 42 CFR 100.3. This \nTable lists for each covered childhood vaccine the conditions that may \nlead to compensation and, for each condition, the time period for \noccurrence of the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of \nsignificant aggravation after vaccine administration. Compensation may \nalso be awarded for conditions not listed in the Table and for \nconditions that are manifested outside the time periods specified in \nthe Table, but only if the petitioner shows that the condition was \ncaused by one of the listed vaccines.\n    Section 2112(b)(2) of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa-12(b)(2), \nrequires that ``[w]ithin 30 days after the Secretary receives service \nof any petition filed under section 2111 the Secretary shall publish \nnotice of such petition in the Federal Register.'' Set forth below is a \nlist of petitions received by HRSA on April 1, 2025, through April 30, \n2025. This list provides the name of the petitioner, city, and state of \nvaccination (if unknown then the city and state of the person or \nattorney filing the claim), and case number. In cases where the Court \nhas redacted the name of a petitioner and/or the case number, the list \nreflects such redaction.\n    Section 2112(b)(2) also provides that the special master ``shall \nafford all interested persons an opportunity to submit relevant, \nwritten information'' relating to the following:\n    1. The existence of evidence ``that there is not a preponderance of \nthe evidence that the illness, disability, injury, condition, or death \ndescribed in the petition is due to factors unrelated to the \nadministration of the vaccine described in the petition,'' and\n    2. Any allegation in a petition that the petitioner either:\n    a. ``[S]ustained, or had significantly aggravated, any illness, \ndisability, injury, or condition not set forth in the Vaccine Injury \nTable but which was caused by'' one of the vaccines referred to in the \nTable, or\n    b. ``[S]ustained, or had significantly aggravated, any illness, \ndisability, injury, or condition set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table \nthe first symptom or manifestation of the onset or significant \naggravation of which did not occur within the time period set forth in \nthe Table but which was caused by a vaccine'' referred to in the Table.\n    In accordance with section 2112(b)(2), all interested persons may \nsubmit written information relevant to the issues described above in \nthe case of the petitions listed below. Any person choosing to do so \nshould file an original and three (3) copies of the information with \nthe Clerk of the United States Court of Federal Claims at the address \nlisted above (under the heading ``For Further Information Contact''), \nwith a copy to HRSA addressed to Director,\n\n[[Page 22098]]\n\nDivision of Injury Compensation Programs, Health Systems Bureau, 5600 \nFishers Lane, 8W-25A, Rockville, Maryland 20857.

The information collection requirements under five CSAPR \ntrading programs and the Texas SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program are \nreflected in the existing ICR as most recently revised in 2018. In \n2021, EPA promulgated an additional CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone trading \nprogram which only includes sources previously subject to another CSAPR \ntrading program reflected in the current ICR. This ICR renewal reflects \nall six CSAPR\n\n[[Page 22092]]\n\ntrading programs and the Texas SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program. Most \naffected sources under the CSAPR and Texas trading programs are also \nsubject to the Acid Rain Program (ARP). The information collection \nrequirements under the CSAPR and Texas trading programs, which consist \nprimarily of requirements to monitor and report emissions data in \naccordance with 40 CFR part 75, substantially overlap and are fully \nintegrated with ARP information collection requirements. The burden and \ncosts of overlapping requirements are accounted for in the ARP ICR (OMB \nControl Number 2060-0258). This ICR accounts for information collection \nburden and costs under the CSAPR and Texas trading programs that are \nincremental to the burden and costs already accounted for in the ARP \nICR. All data received by EPA will be treated as public information.\n    Form Numbers: Agent Notice of Delegation #5900-172, Certificate of \nRepresentation #7610-1, General Account Form #7610-5, Allowance \nTransfer Form #7610-6, Retired Unit Exemption #7610-20, Allowance \nDeduction #7620-4.\n    Respondents/affected entities: Industry respondents are stationary, \nfossil fuel-fired boilers and combustion turbines serving electricity \ngenerators subject to the CSAPR and Texas trading programs, as well as \nnon-source entities voluntarily participating in allowance trading \nactivities. Potential state respondents are states that can elect to \nsubmit state-determined allowance allocations for sources located in \ntheir states.\n    Respondents' obligation to respond: Industry respondents: voluntary \nand mandatory (Sections 110(a) and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act). State \nrespondents: voluntary.\n    Estimated number of respondents: 941 (total); 870 industry \nrespondents, 27 potential state respondents, and 44 non-sources \nentities.\n    Frequency of response: On occasion, quarterly, and annually.\n    Total estimated burden: 109,233 hours (per year). Burden is defined \nat 5 CFR 1320.03(b).\n    Total estimated cost: $16,855,976 (total per year); includes \n$8,207,543.84 annualized capital or operation & maintenance costs.\n    Changes in Estimates: There is decrease of 4,279 hours in the total \nestimated respondent burden compared with the ICR currently approved by \nOMB. This is due to a decrease in the number of regulated sources from \nfacility retirements.\n\nCourtney Kerwin,\nDirector, Information Engagement Division.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09300 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6560-50-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

In general, all NESHAP \nstandards require initial notifications, performance tests, and \nperiodic reports by the owners/operators of the affected facilities. \nThey are also required to maintain records of the occurrence and \nduration of any startup, shutdown, or malfunction in the operation of \nan affected facility, or any period during which the monitoring system \nis inoperative. These notifications, reports, and records are essential \nin determining compliance with 40 CFR part 63, subpart MMM.\n    Form Numbers: None.\n    Respondents/affected entities: Pesticide active ingredient \nproduction facilities.\n\n[[Page 22093]]\n\n    Respondent's obligation to respond: Mandatory (40 CFR part 63, \nsubpart MMM).\n    Estimated number of respondents: 19 (total).\n    Frequency of response: Quarterly and semiannually.\n    Total estimated burden: 13,200 hours (per year). Burden is defined \nat 5 CFR 1320.03(b).\n    Total estimated cost: $2,150,000 (per year), which includes \n$339,000 annualized capital or operation & maintenance costs.\n    Changes in the Estimates: There is no change in hours in the total \nestimated respondent burden compared with the ICR currently approved by \nOMB. This is due to two considerations. First, the regulations have not \nchanged over the past three years and are not anticipated to change \nover the next three years. Second, the growth rate for this industry is \nvery low or non-existent, so there is no significant change in the \noverall burden. This ICR corrects a minor error in the currently \napproved ICR by adding burden for certain new respondents who may be \nrequired to repeat their conducted performance tests; however, this \ncorrection has no significant impact on the overall burden. Since there \nare no changes in the regulatory requirements and there is no \nsignificant industry growth, there are also no changes in the capital/\nstartup or operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.\n\nCourtney Kerwin,\nDirector, Information Engagement Division.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09292 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6560-50-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

This request for \ncomment is being made pursuant to section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA.\n    With respect to the following collection of information, VHA \ninvites comments on: (1) whether the proposed collection of information \nis necessary for the proper performance of VHA's functions, including \nwhether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy \nof VHA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of \ninformation; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of \nthe information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of \nthe collection of information on respondents, including through the use \nof automated collection techniques or the use of other forms of \ninformation technology.\n    Title: Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers\n\n[[Page 22164]]\n\n(PCAFC) Decision Appeal Form (VA Form 10-306).\n    OMB Control Number: 2900-0894. <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch\">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch</a>. (Once at this link, you can enter the OMB Control Number to \nfind the historical versions of this Information Collection.)\n    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.\n    Abstract: The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act \nof 2010 (Pub. L. 111-163) enacted 38 U.S.C. 1720G, which directed the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish a Program of \nComprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) and a Program of \nGeneral Caregiver Support Services (PGCSS). VA's regulations \nimplementing PCAFC and PGCSS are in 38 CFR part 71. Both programs are \nmanaged by VA's Caregiver Support Program (CSP) Office. On June 6, \n2018, the President signed into law the John S. McCain III, Daniel K. \nAkaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and \nStrengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018 or the VA MISSION \nAct 2018 (Pub. L. 115-182). The VA MISSION Act of 2018 expanded the \nPCAFC to Family Caregivers of eligible Veterans of all eras in a phased \napproach, established new benefits for Primary Family Caregivers of \neligible Veterans, and made other changes affecting program eligibility \nand VA's evaluation of PCAFC applications.\n    Since program inception, Veterans and caregivers who disagree with \na PCAFC decision were afforded the right to appeal through the Veterans \nHealth Administration (VHA) Clinical Appeals Process. A 2021 Court \nruling in the case of Jeremy Beaudette & Maya Beaudette v. Denis \nMcDonough, Secretary of Veterans Affairs changed the appeal and review \noptions available to individuals who have received a PCAFC decision and \ndisagree with that decision. In that case, the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor Veterans Claims ruled in favor of petitioners seeking review by the \nBoard of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) of decisions under the PCAFC. \nAs a result of the Court's ruling, BVA review is now available to \nindividuals who have received a decision under the PCAFC since the \nprogram began in May 2011. Consequently, VA expanded options available \nto Veterans and caregivers who seek review of or to appeal a PCAFC \ndecision.\n    The options include a separate appeals process (legacy) that must \nbe used to appeal to the Board regarding PCAFC decisions issued before \nFebruary 19, 2019. The legacy process is implemented through use of VA \nForm 10-306, which allows Veterans and caregivers to request \ninformation about past PCAFC decisions to determine whether they wish \nto pursue an appeal to the Board or request review. VA projects the \nsubmission of a lower number of 10-306 forms going forward because the \nannual number of requests following the court decision has been \ndecreasing over time. CSP is discontinuing VA Form 10-307, which \npreviously was included in this collection, as the form is no longer \nnecessary and will become obsolete. There is a commensurate decrease in \nthe burden hours for this collection due to the discontinuance and \nremoval of VA Form 10-307 and the anticipated decrease in the number of \n10-306 forms that will be received annually by VA.\n    Affected Public: Individuals or Households.\n    Estimated Annual Burden: 12,500 hours.\n    Estimated Average Burden per Respondent: 15 minutes.\n    Frequency of Response: Once annually.\n    Estimated Number of Respondents: 50,000.\n    Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.\n\nLanea Haynes,\nActing, VA PRA Clearance Officer, (Alt.)

Institution of proceedings is \nappropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised \nby the proposed rule change. Institution of proceedings does not \nindicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect \nto any of the issues involved. Rather, the Commission seeks and \nencourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule \nchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,\\14\\ the Commission is \nproviding notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. \nThe Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional \nanalysis of the proposed rule change's consistency with Section 6(b)(5) \nof the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a \nnational securities exchange be ``designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices'' and ``to protect investors and the \npublic interest.'' \\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ Id.\n    \\15\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the \nExchange's statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth \nin the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to \nsubmit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission \nseeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the \nTrust, which would hold SOL, is designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not \npreviously contemplated by the Commission.\n\nIV. Procedure: Request for Written Comments\n\n    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written \nsubmissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the \nissues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have \nwith the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written \nviews of interested persons concerning whether the proposal is \nconsistent with Section 6(b)(5) or any other provision of the Act, and \nthe rules and regulations thereunder. Although there do not appear to \nbe any issues relevant to approval or disapproval that would be \nfacilitated by an oral presentation of views, data, and arguments, the \nCommission will consider, pursuant to Rule 19b-4, any request for an \nopportunity to make an oral presentation.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the Securities \nActs Amendments of 1975, Public Law 94-29 (June 4, 1975), grants the \nCommission flexibility to determine what type of proceeding--either \noral or notice and opportunity for written comments--is appropriate \nfor consideration of a particular proposal by a self-regulatory \norganization.

No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st \nSess. 30 (1975).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and \narguments regarding whether the proposed rule change should be approved \nor disapproved by June 13, 2025.

Institution of proceedings is \nappropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised \nby the proposed rule change. Institution of proceedings does not \nindicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect \nto any of the issues involved. Rather, the Commission seeks and \nencourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule \nchange.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,\\14\\ the Commission is \nproviding notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. \nThe Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional \nanalysis of the proposed rule change's consistency with Section 6(b)(5) \nof the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a \nnational securities exchange be ``designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices'' and ``to protect investors and the \npublic interest.'' \\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ Id.\n    \\15\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the \nExchange's statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth \nin the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to \nsubmit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission \nseeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the \nTrust, which would hold SOL, is designed to prevent fraudulent and \nmanipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not \npreviously contemplated by the Commission.\n\nIV. Procedure: Request for Written Comments\n\n    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written \nsubmissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the \nissues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have \nwith the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written \nviews of interested persons concerning whether the proposal is \nconsistent with Section 6(b)(5) or any other provision of the Act, and \nthe rules and regulations thereunder. Although there do not appear to \nbe any issues relevant to approval or disapproval that would be \nfacilitated by an oral presentation of views, data, and arguments, the \nCommission will consider, pursuant to Rule 19b-4, any request for an \nopportunity to make an oral presentation.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the Securities \nActs Amendments of 1975, Public Law 94-29 (June 4, 1975), grants the \nCommission flexibility to determine what type of proceeding--either \noral or notice and opportunity for written comments--is appropriate \nfor consideration of a particular proposal by a self-regulatory \norganization.

No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st \nSess. 30 (1975).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and \narguments regarding whether the proposed rule change should be approved \nor disapproved by June 13, 2025.

The Applicants have submitted the \ninformation required by 49 CFR 1182.2, including information \ndemonstrating that the proposed transaction is consistent with the \npublic interest under 49 U.S.C. 14303(b), see 49 CFR 1182.2(a)(7), and \na jurisdictional statement under 49 U.S.C. 14303(g) that the aggregate \ngross operating revenues of the involved carriers exceeded $2 million \nduring the 12-month period immediately preceding the filing of the \napplication, see 49 CFR 1182.2(a)(5). (Appl. 6-9.)\n    The Applicants assert that the proposed transaction will not have a \nmaterial, detrimental impact on the adequacy of transportation services \navailable to the public. (Id. at 7.)

The Applicants assert that the market for the \ntransportation services provided by the Acquired Regulated Entities is \ncompetitive in nature, as the areas where such carriers operate are \ngenerally geographically dispersed and the majority of all home-to-\nschool student transportation contracts are subject to competitive bid \nprocesses and the possibility that a school can provide ``in-house'' \nschool bus services. (Id.) The Applicants also state that the \ncompetitors of the Acquired Regulated Entities include First Student, \nStudent Transportation, Inc., North America Central School Bus, Beacon \nMobility, and many other regional and local providers. (Id. at 9.) As \nto charter services, the Applicants assert that the Acquired Regulated \nEntities compete for charter services such as school-related activities \n(athletic and academic competitions, field trips, etc.) and \noccasionally non-school related activities and events but that the \ndemand for such services is limited due to, among other things, a lack \nof amenities on school buses suitable for charter service needs. (Id. \nat 4-5, 9.) Based on the foregoing, the Applicants state that the \nimpact of the proposed transaction will be minimal, at most, and that \nneither competition nor the public interest will be adversely affected. \n(Id. at 9.)\n    With respect to fixed charges, the Applicants assert that such \ncharges are not contemplated to have a material impact on the proposed \ntransaction. (Id. at 7.) The Applicants further state that they do not \nexpect the transaction to have substantial impacts on employees or \nlabor conditions, nor do they anticipate a measurable reduction in \nforce or changes in compensation levels or benefits. (Id.)\n    Based on the Applicants' representations, the Board finds that the \nacquisition of control of the Acquired Regulated Entities is consistent \nwith the public interest and should be tentatively approved and \nauthorized. If any opposing comments are timely filed, these findings \nwill be deemed vacated and, unless a final decision can be made on the \nrecord as developed, a procedural schedule will be adopted to \nreconsider the application. See 49 CFR 1182.6.

The agency will summarize and/or include \nyour comments in the request for OMB's clearance of this information \ncollection.\n    OMB Control Number: 2120-0777.\n    Title: Pilot Certification Unmanned Aircraft Systems.\n    Form Numbers: 8710-13.\n    Type of Review: Renewal of an information collection.\n    Background: Subpart C of title 14 Code of Federal Regulations part \n107 (14 CFR part 107), Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, provides \nrequirements for applicants to obtain a remote pilot certificate, and \nestablishes procedures for applicants to apply for such certificates. \nPart 107 also refers to a provision in 14 CFR part 61, as applicants \nwho already hold a certificate under 14 CFR part 61 are eligible to \nobtain a remote pilot certificate by completing an initial training \ncourse in a manner acceptable to the Administrator.\n    Persons applying for a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS \nrating under part 107 must submit information using the FAA Form 8710-\n13, Remote Pilot Certificate and/or Rating Application. For applicants \nwho do not hold a pilot certificate under part 61, the Remote Pilot \nCertificate and/or Rating Application is submitted along with a \ndocumentation demonstrating that the applicant has passed an \naeronautical knowledge test. For applicants who hold a pilot \ncertificate under part 61 and meet the flight review requirements of \nSec.  61.56, the Remote Pilot Certificate and/or Rating Application is \nsubmitted with evidence of completion of a training course.\n    The FAA has an electronic data collection system called the \nIntegrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA). IACRA \nis a secure web-based application that uses online validation and \ndigital signatures to complete the remote pilot certificate application \ndocuments. IACRA interfaces with multiple FAA databases such as \nknowledge testing and airman records for data validation and \nverification. It automatically ensures that applicants meet regulatory \nand policy requirements.\n    IACRA improves the airman certification process by checking for \ndata errors that cause rejected applications. The certification \nprocessing time is reduced since the applicant, recommending instructor \n(if required), and inspector/examiner can complete the airman \napplication online and can submit the completed application \nelectronically using digital signatures. OMB has used IACRA as an \nexample of FAA's compliance with the Government Paperwork Elimination \nAct.\n    Respondents: Persons submitting an application for a Remote Pilot \nCertificate and/or Rating for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, \nsubmitted either in paper form or online using the FAA's Integrated \nAirman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA) website. \nApproximately 59,000 applications submitted annually.\n    Frequency: On occasion, once per applicant.\n    Estimated Average Burden per Response: 15 minutes.\n    Estimated Total Annual Burden: One response per applicant per year; \n14,750 hours total per year for all applicants.\n\n    Issued in Washington, DC, on May 19, 2025.\nJoseph Morra,\nManager, Emerging Technologies Division, AFS-700.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09268 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4910-13-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Introduction\n\n    This interim Order establishes a temporary reduced targeted \nscheduling limit on the number of scheduled operations at Newark \nLiberty International Airport (EWR) reflected in authorized scheduled \ntimings. The Acting Administrator of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) is issuing this Order as a result of a persistent \nnumber of flights above capacity at EWR. This Order is intended to \nrelieve the substantial inconvenience to the traveling public caused by \nexcessive flight delays at the airport due to construction, staffing \nchallenges, and recent equipment issues, which magnify as they spread \nthrough the National Airspace System. This Order aims to provide a more \nefficient use of the nation's airspace and alleviate temporary \nconditions exacerbating delays at EWR. This Order takes effect on May \n20, 2025, and will expire upon the implementation of a final order.\n\nII. Background\n\n    The U.S. Government has exclusive sovereignty over the airspace of \nthe United States.\\1\\ Under this broad authority, Congress has \ndelegated to the Administrator extensive and plenary authority to \nensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of the nation's \nnavigable airspace. In this regard, the Administrator is required to \nassign the use of navigable airspace by regulation or order under such \nterms, conditions and limitations as he may deem necessary to ensure \nits efficient use.\\2\\ The Administrator may modify or revoke an \nassignment when required in the public interest.\\3\\ Furthermore, in \ncarrying out the Administrator's safety responsibilities under the \nstatute, the Administrator must consider controlling the use of the \nnavigable airspace and regulating civil operations in that airspace in \nthe interest of the safety and efficiency of those operations.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 49 U.S.C. 40103.\n    \\2\\ 49 U.S.C. 40103(b)(1), as previously codified in 49 U.S.C. \nApp. Sec.  307(a). Title 49 was recodified by Public Law 103-222, \n108 Stat. 745 (1994). The textual revisions were not intended to \nresult in substantive changes to the law. The recodification stated \nthat the words in Sec.  307(a) ``under such terms, conditions, and \nlimitations as he may deem'' were omitted as surplus. H. Rpt. 103-\n180 (103d Cong., 1st Sess. 1993) at 262.\n    \\3\\ Id.\n    \\4\\ 49 U.S.C. 40101(d)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The FAA's statutory authority to manage ``the efficient use of \nairspace'' encompasses its management of the nationwide system of air \ncommerce and air traffic control. Ensuring the efficient use of the \nairspace means that FAA must take all necessary steps to prevent \nextreme congestion at an airport from disrupting or adversely affecting \nthe overall air traffic system for which FAA is responsible. Further, \ndelays at EWR frustrate the efficient operations of air carriers \ntransporting passengers to and from this important region. The impacts \nof delays at EWR spread throughout the NAS, resulting in substantial \neconomic loss for the traveling public, air carriers, shippers, and \nothers.\n\nEWR Level 2 Designation\n\n    On April 6, 2016, FAA designated EWR as a Level 2 schedule-\nfacilitated airport under the International Air Transportation \nAssociation (IATA)\n\n[[Page 22148]]\n\nWorldwide Slot Guidelines (WSG), effective October 30, 2016.\\5\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ 81 FR 19861 (April 6, 2016).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The FAA does not allocate slots, apply historic precedence, or \nimpose minimum usage requirements at EWR. Level 2 schedule facilitation \ndepends upon close and continuous discussions and voluntary agreement \nbetween airlines and FAA to reduce congestion. At Level 2 airports, FAA \nprovides priority consideration for flights approved by FAA and \noperated by the carrier in those approved times in the prior scheduling \nseason when FAA reviews proposed flights for facilitation in the next \ncorresponding scheduling season. Only those flights that were actually \noperated as approved in the prior scheduling season generally receive \npriority for the next corresponding scheduling season. However, FAA \nnotes that the usual Level 2 processes include flexibility for the \nfacilitator to prioritize planned flights that are canceled in advance \nor on the day of the scheduled operation due to operational impacts \nbeyond the control of the carrier.\n    Although FAA redesignated EWR from a Level 3 to Level 2 airport in \n2016, FAA has continuously monitored the airport's performance due to \nits prominence in the NAS and impact on the system overall. As such, \nEWR implemented targeted scheduling limits in an effort to minimize \ndelay and congestion. The current baseline targeted scheduling limit \nfor EWR is 77 operations per hour.\\6\\ The FAA has implemented a number \nof mitigations to address delays at the airport due to staffing \nchallenges and runway construction.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ 89 FR 43501 (May 17, 2024).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStaffing-Related Relief at EWR\n\n    On March 27, 2023, FAA announced a limited policy for prioritizing \nup to ten percent of a carrier's returned operations at EWR, due to \npost-pandemic effects on ATC staffing at New York Terminal Radar \nApproach Control (TRACON)(N90), for purposes of establishing a \ncarrier's operational baseline in the next corresponding season.\\7\\ The \nFAA determined that the interdependency and complexity of the airspace, \nnumber of flights into the New York City region, and N90 staffing \nshortfalls met the applicable waiver standard for the N90's Level 3 \nairports and justified an offer of relief for carriers at EWR. The FAA \nextended this relief through the close of the Summer 2025 Scheduling \nSeason.\\8\\ This relief is part of a continuous effort, in partnership \nwith air carriers, to manage traffic at EWR safely and efficiently \nwhile staffing levels improve.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ 88 FR 18032 (March 27, 2023).\n    \\8\\ 90 FR 12931 (March 19, 2024).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEWR Construction\n\n    On November 20, 2024, FAA announced a limited, conditional policy \nfor prioritizing returned operations at EWR due to a construction-\nrelated runway closure at EWR for purposes of establishing a carrier's \noperational baseline in the next corresponding scheduling seasons.\\9\\ \nRunway 4L-22R has been and remains closed daily from April 15, 2025, \nthrough June 15, 2025. Weekend closures of Runway 4L-22R were scheduled \nfrom March 1, 2025, to April 14, 2025, and will resume September 1, \n2025, to December 31, 2025, from Friday at 11:00 p.m. through 5:00 a.m. \non Sunday, Eastern Time.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ 89 FR 91544 (November 20, 2024).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The FAA worked with carriers to address the impact this runway \nclosure has on scheduled operations for the Summer 2025 and Winter \n2025/2026 scheduling seasons. The FAA requested that carriers reduce \noperations from April 15, 2025, through June 15, 2205, to no more than \n35 arrivals per hour from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time and no \nmore than 31 arrivals per hour from 3:00 p.m. to the end of the day, \nEastern Time. The FAA also requested that carriers reduce operations to \nno more than 35 departures per hour through 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, \nand no more than 31 departures per hour from 5:00 p.m. through the end \nof the day, Eastern Time. The FAA stated that no new requested timings \nwould be approved during the runway closure period.\n\nAir Traffic Controller Staffing Status\n\n    Since July of 2024, Philadelphia TRACON (PHL) has been the TRACON \nfacility responsible for overseeing the Newark area. PHL's targeted \nstaffing number is 114 Certified Professional Controllers (CPCs); the \ncurrent onboard number at PHL is 82, representing 71.9% staffed. Area \nC, overseeing the Newark area, has a targeted staffing number of 38 \nCPCs, with its current staff of 24 CPCs representing 63% staffed. Under \nan arrangement by the previous administration, by the end of July 2026, \n16 CPCs currently assigned to Area C will return to N90, which \npreviously oversaw the Newark area. Actions are currently underway to \ntrain CPCs for Area C and to replace those 16 CPCs. PHL currently has \n26 trainees, and many of these have previous experience at higher level \nfacilities and are expected to certify in less time than typical. This \npipeline of personnel will allow FAA to build up CPC staffing for Area \nC.\n\nEquipment Outages\n\n    EWR recently experienced technology issues at PHL which guides \naircraft in and out of the airport.\\10\\ The FAA is taking steps to \nimmediately shore up the reliability of equipment and operations at EWR \nin light of these outages. However, these outages lead to disruptions \nin operations causing delays and impact CPCs serving the airport.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ Update: Newark Liberty International Airport, FAA General \nStatements (May 7, 2025). FAA General Statements [verbar] Federal \nAviation Administration\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIII. Decision To Convene a Delay Reduction Meeting\n\n    The convergence of underlying staffing challenges, PHL equipment \nissues caused by an antiquated air traffic control system, and runway \nclosures due to construction has resulted in the current operational \nlevels at EWR becoming untenable.\n    Congress authorized the Secretary of Transportation to ask U.S. air \ncarriers to meet with the FAA to discuss flight reductions at severely \ncongested airports to reduce overscheduling and flight delays during \npeak operating hours.\\11\\ Under this authority, the Secretary and \nActing Administrator of the FAA determined that such a meeting was \nnecessary to address delays and congestion at EWR.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ 49 U.S.C. 41722(a).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Through a notice issued on May 14, 2025, and published in the \nFederal Register, FAA invited U.S. air carriers with scheduled \noperations at EWR and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey \n(PANYNJ) to attend the scheduling reduction meeting commencing on May \n14, 2025.\\12\\ The FAA invited all other interested parties and persons \nto submit information on the subject of operations at EWR to a public \ndocket for FAA's consideration in issuing this Order.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ 90 FR 20545 (May 14, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV. Determination of Operational Targets\n\n    The statute authorizing the Administrator to conduct a scheduling \nreduction meeting requires FAA to establish operational targets for the \nefficient scheduling of the airport.\\13\\ The FAA announced the proposed \noperational targets in the Notice of the Delay Reduction Meeting and \ninvite to carriers. The FAA reviewed the current delay and cancellation \nrates at EWR against the approved schedules during\n\n[[Page 22149]]\n\nthe construction period and for the remainder of Summer 2025 Scheduling \nSeason. As previously stated in the Notice of the Delay Reduction \nMeeting announcing the scheduling reduction meeting, since April 15, \n2025, cancellations at EWR are occurring at a rate of one to four per \nhour, with an increase in the afternoon and evening, averaging about 34 \narrival cancellations per day.\\14\\ The number of delayed arrivals is \nconsistently high, beginning with an average of five in the 7:00 a.m. \nhour and increasing throughout the day to an average of 16 between 7:00 \np.m. and 11:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The average delay duration is 85 \nminutes at 7:00 a.m. and increases to 137 minutes at 5:00 p.m., Eastern \nTime. This rate declines, but holds, at about 100 minutes per flight at \nthe end of the day. Overall, the data shows variability in scheduled \nversus actual arrivals, with a corresponding increased level of delayed \narrivals across the hours of the day.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ 49 U.S.C. 41722(c).\n    \\14\\ 90 FR 20545, 20546 (May 14, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Based on FAA's analysis of the data, FAA proposed an hourly arrival \nrate of no more than 28 operations, with a corresponding hourly \ndeparture rate of 28 operations, resulting in no more than 56 total \noperations per hour during the remainder of the construction \nperiod.\\15\\ The construction period is defined as the daily closure of \nRunway 4L/22R until June 15, 2025, and weekends from September 1, 2025, \nthrough December 31, 2025, from Friday at 11:00 p.m. through 5:00 a.m. \non Sunday, Eastern Time. Outside of the construction period, through \nthe end of Summer 2025 scheduling season ending on October 25, 2025, \nFAA proposed a targeted scheduling rate of 34 arrivals per hour, with a \ncorresponding departure rate of 34 operations, resulting in no more \nthan 68 total operations per hour. The FAA determines that this \noperational target would reduce overscheduling, flight delays, and \ncancellations to an acceptable level at EWR and ensure the efficient \nuse of the NAS. These operational targeted scheduling limits for this \nperiod will take place between 6:00 a.m. and 10:59 p.m., Eastern Time.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ Foreign carrier operations are factored into each reduced \ntargeted scheduling limit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nV. Meetings With the U.S. Air Carriers\n\n    The FAA convened the scheduling reduction meeting with the U.S. air \ncarrier participants and representatives from the PANYNJ on May 14, \n2025, and the meetings continued until its recess on May 16, 2025. The \nFAA had separate meeting sessions over the three days with seven air \ncarriers and the PANYNJ. In these meetings, FAA and carriers discussed \nvoluntary modifications to schedules during the construction period and \nthrough the rest of the Summer 2025 Scheduling Season. Representatives \nof the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and the Department of \nTransportation monitored the joint and individual meeting sessions of \nthe scheduling reduction meeting. In addition, the in-person sessions \nwere transcribed.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ The FAA has not yet formally adjourned the meeting. In the \nevent that further meeting sessions are required, the meeting is in \nrecess status prior to the issuance of final order to provide \nparties the opportunity to make additional voluntary schedule \nreductions and modifications.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The FAA stated that immediate action is required to address the \nsituation at EWR. Since the daily runway closures conclude on June 15, \n2025, and this schedule reduction meeting occurred during the Summer \n2025 Scheduling Season, there is a limited window to implement schedule \nmodifications. The FAA commends the carriers, especially United \nAirlines, Spirit Airlines, Allegiant Airlines, Alaska Airlines, and \nAmerican Airlines, that made substantial schedule adjustments to \naccommodate the reduced rate during the construction period prior to \nthe meetings.\n    The discussions were productive and, by the time of the meeting \nrecess, participating carriers contributed a level of reduction almost \nat the proposed targets. On Friday, May 16, 2025, the FAA stated that \nfurther discussions with participating carriers will be necessary to \nfinalize the reductions and re-timings proposed and agreed upon in the \nindividual sessions.\n    On Monday, May 19, 2025, FAA determined that additional reductions \nwere necessary for specific hours and subsequently advised those \ncarriers affected by further reductions. The FAA has confirmed with \neach carrier their remaining operations following these reductions. \nThese confirmed operations are designated authorized scheduled timings \nfor EWR for the purposes of this interim order.\n    U.S. and foreign air carriers, the PANYNJ, and other interested \nparties were also invited by the May 14, 2025, Federal Register notice \nto provide whatever information and opinion they deemed relevant to \nFAA's ultimate decision. The Notice stated that FAA will work with \nforeign carriers using the IATA guidelines to address any voluntary \nreductions foreign carriers would like to propose during this period. \nAll U.S. and foreign carriers are invited to contact the Slot \nAdministration Office with any additional proposed reductions or \nschedule modifications that would contribute to the overall effort to \nreduce operations at EWR. The FAA will take any additional proposed \nreductions or modifications into consideration before issuing a final \nOrder in this matter.\n\nVI. Revised Hourly Targeted Schedule Limitations\n\n    As established in the Notice and in sessions with carriers during \nthe delay reduction meetings, the hourly targeted schedule limitations \nare reduced below current levels at two different rates depending on if \nthe operation falls during or outside the construction periods.\n    Every day until June 15, 2025, and on weekends from September 1, \n2025, through December 31, 2025, from Friday at 11:00 p.m. through 5:00 \na.m. on Sunday, Eastern Time, the targeted limit is no more than 28 \narrivals and 28 departures per hour. Outside of the construction \nperiod, until the close of the Summer 2025 Scheduling Season, October \n25, 2025, the limit is no more than 34 arrivals and departures per \nhour. The FAA will continue to work with carriers to smooth their \nschedules and to adjust the timing of arriving and departing flights so \nas not to overwhelm a particular hour in the event of delays or other \noperational issues.\n\nVII. Foreign Air Carriers\n\n    Prior to the issuance of a final Order, the FAA Slot Administration \nOffice asks that foreign carriers assess their operations at EWR and \npropose any voluntary schedule reductions or modifications that may \nalleviate congestion at EWR. The FAA will work with foreign carriers to \nmaintain historic prioritization for any previously approved timings \nfor the purposes of establishing an operational baseline for the next \ncorresponding season.\n\nVIII. Unscheduled Operations and New Scheduled Operations\n\n    The FAA will not accommodate new unscheduled or scheduled \noperations through the construction period or remainder of the Summer \n2025 Scheduling Season at EWR. New operations during this time period \ncould exacerbate the existing conditions and undo the purpose of the \nscheduling reduction meetings, which is to achieve operational \nstability at EWR.\n\nIX. Operational Flexibility\n\n    Based on FAA's experience with capacity-constrained airports, FAA \nanticipates that carriers may occasionally need to modify their\n\n[[Page 22150]]\n\nschedule times for operational or other reasons while this Order is in \neffect. Accordingly, this Order provides a mechanism through which such \ncarriers can modify their schedules.\n    Carriers operating at EWR must obtain the Administrator's written \napproval before making a schedule change that would be outside the \nhourly window associated with an authorized timing.\n    The FAA recognizes that the Winter 2025/2026 schedule submission \ndate was May 15, 2025. The FAA will work with carriers to accommodate \nschedules proposed for Saturdays in the construction period in the \nWinter 2025/2026 Scheduling Season.\n    The FAA recognizes that there may be unexpected times when a \ncarrier's operations are greatly disrupted due to operation issues, \nweather, or other circumstances beyond the carrier's control. Since EWR \nis a Level 2 airport, FAA will work the carrier on any additional \nrelief needed to prioritize impacted operations for the purposes of \nestablishing operational baselines for the next corresponding season.\n    Accordingly, with respect to scheduled flight operations at EWR, \nunder the authority provided to the Secretary of Transportation and the \nFAA Administrator by 49 U.S.C. 40101, 40103, 40113, and 41722, it is \nhereby ordered that:\n    1. This Order modifies the targeted scheduling limit for arrivals \nand departures at EWR during the affected hours for the U.S. air \ncarriers who operate at EWR as reflected by scheduled authorized \ntimings. The FAA will not accommodate authorized scheduled timings \nunder this Order to any person or entity other than a certificated U.S. \nair carrier with appropriate economic authority and FAA operating \nauthority under 14 CFR part 121, 129, or 135. This Order further \naffirms that FAA will not accommodate new requests or re-timings by \nother domestic or foreign carriers during the period this Order is \neffective. Under this interim Order, carriers may submit additional \nvoluntary returns to be included in the final order. The FAA Vice \nPresident, System Operations Services, is the final decision-maker for \ndeterminations under this paragraph. This Order applies to the \nfollowing:\n    a. All U.S. air carriers conducting scheduled operations at EWR as \nof the date of this Order, any U.S. air carrier that operates under the \nsame designator code as such carrier, and any air carrier that has or \nenters into a codeshare agreement with such carrier.\n    b. All U.S. air carriers operating scheduled or regularly conducted \ncommercial service to EWR while this Order is in effect.\n    2. This Order modifies targeted scheduled arrivals and departures \nat EWR from 6 a.m. through 10:59 p.m., Eastern Time, until October 25, \n2025, and weekends from September 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025, \nfrom Friday at 11:00 p.m. through 5:00 a.m. on Sunday.\n    3. This Order takes effect on May 20, 2025 and expires upon the \nissuance of a final order consistent with these proceedings to allow \nfor continued dialogue between air carriers and FAA to finalize \nschedule reductions and modifications.\n    4. The following procedures apply to authorized scheduled timings \nat EWR:\n    a. Scheduled air carrier arrivals and departures should not exceed \n28 per hour, respectively, from 6 a.m. through 10:59 p.m., Eastern Time \nuntil June 15, 2025, and weekends from September 1, 2025, through \nDecember 31, 2025, from Friday at 11:00 p.m. through 5:00 a.m. on \nSunday, Eastern Time. From June 16, 2025, through October 25, 2025, \narrivals and departures should not exceed 34 per hour, respectively, \naside from the Saturdays designated as part of the construction period \nwhen the lower targeted rate applies.\n    b. The Administrator may change the targeted limits if he \ndetermines that capacity exists to accommodate additional operations \nwithout a significant increase in delays.\n    5. A carrier operating an authorized scheduled timing may request \nthe Administrator's approval to move any arrival or departure scheduled \nfrom 6 a.m. through 10:59 p.m. to another half hour within that period. \nExcept as provided in paragraph seven, the carrier must receive the \nwritten approval of the Administrator, or his delegate, prior to \nconducting any scheduled arrival or departure. All requests to move an \nauthorized scheduled timing must be submitted to the FAA Slot \nAdministration Office, telephone (202) 267-2822 or email <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9cabb1ddcbddb1cff0f3e8fdf8f1f5f2dcfafdfdb2fbf3ea\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"06312b4751472b556a697267626b6f684660676728616970\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, and must come from a designated representative of \nthe carrier.\n    6. Notice of a swap under this paragraph must be submitted in \nwriting to the FAA Slot Administration Office, telephone (202) 267-2822 \nor email <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7443593523355927181b001510191d1a341215155a131b02\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"50677d1107117d033c3f2431343d393e103631317e373f26\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, and must come from a designated \nrepresentative of each carrier. The FAA must confirm and approve these \nexchanges in writing prior to the effective date of the exchange. The \nFAA will approve swaps between carriers under the same marketing \ncontrol up to 72-hours after the actual operation, but only to \naccommodate operational disruptions that occur on the same day of the \nscheduled operation.\n    7. Any authorized scheduled timing not used during the remainder of \nthe Summer 2025 Scheduling Season or applicable dates in the Winter \n2025/2026 period will not be prioritized for the purposes of \nestablishing an operational baseline for the next corresponding season \nunless the carrier notifies the FAA of a request for prioritization. \nThe FAA and DOT review such requests, and FAA will respond to the \ncarrier with an acknowledgement of relief.\n    8. If FAA determines that a further reduction in targeted scheduled \noperations is needed, the FAA may call an additional scheduling \nreduction meeting pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 41722.\n    9. The FAA will enforce this Order through an enforcement action \nseeking a civil penalty under 49 U.S.C. 46301(a). A carrier that is not \na small business as defined in the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, \nwill be liable for a civil penalty of up to $75,000 for every flight it \noperates above the limits set forth in this Order. A carrier that is a \nsmall business as defined in the Small Business Act will be liable for \na civil penalty of up to $16,630 for every flight it operates above the \nlimits set forth in this Order. The FAA also could file a civil action \nin U.S. District Court, under 49 U.S.C. 46106, 46107, seeking to enjoin \nany air carrier from violating the terms of this Order.\n    10. The FAA may modify or withdraw any provision in this Order on \nits own or on application by any carrier for good cause shown.\n\n    Issued in Washington, DC, on May 20, 2025.\nChristopher J. Rocheleau,\nActing Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09376 Filed 5-21-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4910-13-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

The IIJA provides about $1,020,000,000 annually, for five years, \nto award competitive grants for airport terminal and tower development. \nOf this amount, about $1,000,000,000 annually, for five years, is for \nthe Airport Terminal Program; $20,000,000 annually, for five years, is \nfor an Airport-owned Contract Tower Program. Additionally, the IIJA \ndirects funds that are unobligated at the end of the fourth fiscal year \nafter first made available under the Airport Infrastructure Grant (AIG) \nprogram to be converted to a new competitive funding program for the \nfifth and final fiscal year of availability. Of the amounts converted, \nthe first $100,000,000 is set aside to augment the IIJA's Airport-owned \nContract Tower Program grant program. Funds exceeding $100,000,000 are \nthen awarded through the new competitive grant program, called the \nAirport Infrastructure Grant Funding Reallocation Program (AFR). The \ninformation collected is based on grant considerations and priorities \noutlined in the IIJA. Project consideration areas include increasing \nterminal capacity and passenger access; replacing aging infrastructure; \nachieving compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 \nU.S.C. 12101, et seq.); improving airport access for historically \ndisadvantaged populations; improving energy efficiency; improving \nairfield safety through terminal relocation; encouraging actual and \npotential\n\n[[Page 22152]]\n\ncompetition; impact on the National Airspace System; reducing \nemissions; reducing noise impact to the surrounding community; reducing \ndependence on the electrical grid; and providing general benefits to \nthe surrounding community. The information FAA is collecting will \ninclude general airport information, a project overview, and narratives \non project consideration areas as outlined in the IIJA. Airport owners \nand managers who want to pursue funding and obtain benefits from the \nIIJA Programs will submit information via FAA Form 5100-144 to compete \nfor grants. Approximately 3,075 airports are eligible to compete for \nthis funding, but, based on previous-year submissions, the FAA expects \nonly a small subset of eligible airports to submit project information \nthrough this competitive grant process.\n    Respondents: Approximately 655 airports.\n    Frequency: Annually.\n    Estimated Average Burden per Response: 6 hours.\n    Estimated Total Annual Burden: 3,930 hours for all respondents.\n\n    Issued in Washington, DC, on May 19, 2025.\nJesse Carriger,\nManager, Infrastructure Branch Office of Airports.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09248 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4910-13-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

The NEPA process is anticipated to be \ncompleted by a combined Final EIS and Record of Decision within two \nyears of issuance of this NOI.\n    The project subject to this notice is:\n    Project Location: The project limits include the existing east-west \nNimmo Parkway/Nimmo Trail right-of-way, which extends approximately 1.9 \nmiles between Albuquerque Drive and Sandbridge Road east of McClannan's \nCurve, and approximately 3.4 miles of Sandbridge Road between Entrada \nDrive to just east of McClannan's Curve.\n\nProposed Project Action\n\n    Background. The City of Virginia Beach has studied a direct \nconnection to the Sandbridge community since 1968. An east-west \ncorridor to the community was included in the City's Master \nTransportation Plan in 1971, the 1979 and 1985 Comprehensive Plans. In \n1999, a corridor study completed by the City of Virginia Beach \nrecommended the Nimmo Parkway Corridor, with a bridge over Ashville \nBridge Creek, as the preferred alternative in linking General Booth \nBoulevard/Princess Anne Road with the Sandbridge community. In 2003, \nplanning studies were conducted on the Nimmo Parkway Corridor which \ndetermined that, when compared to other corridor improvement projects \nfor the area, the Nimmo Parkway Corridor alternative was preferred. In \nsubsequent years, additional improvements have been made along Nimmo \nParkway and Sandbridge Road, with the construction of existing Nimmo \nParkway occurring in four phases over a 30-year period.\n    In May 2022, FHWA approved an Environmental Assessment (EA) for \npublic availability for the EA for this proposed Project included a \nstudy area limited to an east-west corridor of approximately 1.85 miles \nbetween the end of existing Nimmo Parkway to the west at Albuquerque \nDrive and Sandbridge Road approximately 0.2 miles past McClannan's \nCurve, as well as the Sandbridge Road corridor, approximately 3.4 \nmiles, from Entrada Drive to approximately 0.2 miles past McClannan's \nCurve in the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\n[[Page 22153]]\n\n    The Nimmo Parkway Phase VII-B EA evaluated two alternatives, the No \nBuild and Build. The No Build Alternative was retained to serve as a \nbaseline for comparison. The single Build Alternative was a 1.8-mile-\nlong two-lane undivided roadway extending from Albuquerque Drive to \nSandbridge Road with an 800-foot proposed bridge over Ashville Bridge \nCreek.\n    A public hearing on the EA was held on June 8, 2022. Based on \npublic and agency comments on the EA, in September 2023, FHWA \ndetermined that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required for \nthe Project (23 CFR 771.119(i)). Federal agency comments on the EA \nstated a need to analyze an additional alternative, specifically \nimprovements to existing Sandbridge Road within the City of Virginia \nBeach. This alternative had been considered in the EA but was not \nretained for detailed evaluation, because improvements to existing \nSandbridge Road would have higher right-of-way, environmental impacts \nand costs than the Build Alternative (see Section 2.2.1 of the EA for \nmore details). Agency coordination on the EIS began in April 2024 with \nan understanding among FHWA, VDOT, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \n(USACE), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service (USFWS) that the Build Alternative from the EA and \nimprovements to existing Sandbridge Road would be further evaluated as \nstandalone alternatives.\n    More information regarding the following sections is included in \nthe Additional Project Information Document.\n    The Preliminary Purpose and Need for the Proposed Agency Action. \nBased upon the unreliable conditions of Sandbridge Road and the \nincreasing risk of flooding, the preliminary purpose and need of the \nNimmo Parkway Phase VII-B proposed Project is to provide reliable \naccess and connectivity to the Sandbridge community. Flooding, roadway \ndeficiencies, and crashes and other obstructions are needs that have \nbeen identified that limit reliable access and connectivity.\n    Sandbridge Road is currently the only public access in and out of \nthe Sandbridge community connecting it to the rest of the City of \nVirginia Beach. However, the existing conditions of Sandbridge Road \ncause the roadway to be impassable due to flooding, accidents, and \nother obstructions.\n    The preliminary Purpose and Need was developed with agency \ncoordination and public input, as described in this NOI; see the \nAdditional Project Information Document for details on the development \nof the Purpose and Need. Agencies and the public are invited to comment \non the preliminary Purpose and Need. The preliminary Purpose and Need \nmay be revised based on comments received during the comment period on \nthis notice. The Purpose and Need statement and supporting \ndocumentation, including data and public input summary, will be \navailable in the Draft EIS. The preliminary Purpose and Need has been \ndiscussed with Cooperating and Participating agencies, including \ninformation contained in the Additional Project Information Document.\n    A Preliminary Description of the Proposed Action and Alternatives \nthe Environmental Impact Statement Will Consider. The preliminary \nproposed action includes transportation improvements in the Sandbridge \ncommunity and surrounding areas within the City of Virginia Beach. \nAgencies and the public are invited to comment on the Range of \nAlternatives for the proposed action. The preliminary Range of \nAlternatives has been discussed with Cooperating and Participating \nagencies, including information contained in the Additional Project \nInformation Document. Additional information on the Range of \nAlternatives is in the Additional Project Information Document. The \nRange of Alternatives proposed to be considered in the EIS include:\n\nNo Build\n\n    The No Build Alternative will be retained for detailed study and \nwill serve as a benchmark for comparison with the build alternatives. \nThe No Build Alternative would maintain roadways in the current \nconfiguration and includes existing planned improvements. Within the \nStudy Area, Sandbridge Road is currently a two-lane, undivided roadway \nwith no shoulders. Within the Study Area and at its intersection with \nAlbuquerque Drive, existing Nimmo Parkway is a two-lane, undivided \nroadway with curb-and-gutter and a shared-use path. The No Build \nAlternative includes existing maintenance and any current fiscally-\nconstrained projects. This alternative would not affect any social, \neconomic, cultural, or natural resources.\n\nNimmo Parkway\n\n    The Nimmo Parkway Alternative is approximately 1.8 miles long and \nextends from Albuquerque Drive to Sandbridge Road at a point \napproximately 0.8 miles west of its terminus at the Atlantic Ocean. \nThis alternative would include new alignment to extend existing Nimmo \nParkway to the east and connect to Sandbridge Road. This alternative \nconsists of a 2-lane undivided roadway, 12-foot travel lanes, 4-foot \non-road bike lane, and a 4-foot-wide paved shoulder in both directions. \nFour-foot-wide graded shoulders are included along the paved shoulders. \nA 10-foot-wide shared-use path would be included on one side of the \nroadway with an 8-foot buffer. The Nimmo Parkway Alternative includes \nspanning Ashville Bridge Creek via an 800-foot-long bridge.\n\nImprovements to Existing Sandbridge Road\n\n    This Build Alternative would improve the existing Sandbridge Road \ncorridor between Entrada Drive to Sandbridge Road at a point \napproximately 0.8 miles west of its terminus at the Atlantic Ocean. \nThis alternative would consist of the same dimensions as the Nimmo \nParkway Alternative. The improvements would also include elevating the \nroadway to minimize the risk of flooding and improving the horizontal \ncurves on the roadway where necessary.\n\nConcepts Considered but Proposed Not To Be Retained for Consideration \nin the EIS\n\nTransportation System Management (TSM)/Transportation Demand Management \n(TDM) Improvements\n    TSM/TDM improvements are operational improvements that do not \nnecessarily involve physical changes to infrastructure but rather \nmaximize the efficiency of the current transportation system or reduce \nthe demand for travel on the system through the implementation of low-\ncost improvements. Examples of TSM activities include the addition of \nturn lanes, optimized signalization at intersections, and electronic \nIntelligent Transportation Systems. Examples of TDM activities include \nride sharing, van and carpooling, installation of park and ride \nfacilities, and encouragement of teleworking.\n    Stand-alone TSM/TDM improvements are proposed to not be retained \nbecause they would not provide reliable access and connectivity to the \nSandbridge community.\nTransit-Only Improvements\n    Transit-only improvements considered include additional bus \nservices, such as new buses or lines to supplement the existing Hampton \nRoads Transit (HRT) system which services the City of Virginia Beach. \nPer the City of Virginia Beach Master Transportation Plan, an HRT line \ncurrently accesses as\n\n[[Page 22154]]\n\nfar as Upton Drive on Nimmo Parkway; there is no existing service to \nthe Sandbridge community. HRT performs market analysis reviews to \nassess the demand for transit services by evaluating areas with high \nconcentration of potential transit users, commuters, jobs, and non-work \ndestinations, along with travel flow analysis. Per the HRT Fiscal Year \n2018-2027 Transit Development Plan, the Project vicinity falls within \nan area of low potential transit utilization and there are no plans to \nexpand service in this area of the city.\n    Stand-alone transit-only improvements are proposed to not be \nretained because they would not provide reliable access and \nconnectivity to the Sandbridge community.\n    The alternatives to be retained will be finalized after the \nconsideration of public comments received during the comment period on \nthis Notice, and they will be documented in the Draft EIS. The \nalternatives may be revised based on the consideration of public \ncomments. The alternatives not retained will also be documented in the \nDraft EIS. See the Additional Project Information Document for a more \ndetailed description of the development of the preliminary Range of \nAlternatives.\n    Brief Summary of Expected Effects. The EIS will evaluate the \npotential social, economic, and environmental effects resulting from \nthe implementation of the build alternatives and the No Build \nAlternative. FHWA and VDOT will seek input from the public and agencies \nduring the EIS development process regarding the effects of the \nProject. FHWA and VDOT will evaluate effects to environmental and \ncommunity resources in accordance with their NEPA guidance and \nprocedures. The following resources are the most sensitive resources in \nthe Project area and will be evaluated closely by FHWA and VDOT:\n    <bullet> Wetlands and other Waters of the U.S.: Both build \nalternatives would require fill and removal from Waters of the U.S. and \nimpacts to wetlands considered to be jurisdictional which will require \na permit from the USACE for the discharge of dredged or fill material \ninto Waters of the U.S., including wetlands.\n    <bullet> Section 4(f): Both build alternatives are located adjacent \nto lands included in the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, which is \nmanaged by the USFWS. There is the potential for impacts to the Refuge, \nwhich is a Section 4(f) property. Potential impacts to this Section \n4(f) property will be analyzed and coordinated in accordance with 23 \nCFR part 774.\n    <bullet> Wildlife and wildlife habitat: Both build alternatives \nhave the potential to impact wildlife and wildlife habitat. Such \nimpacts would be assessed to consider footprint impacts, the effects of \nnoise and visual disturbance from construction and operations, \npotential wildlife-vehicle collisions, and habitat connectivity. This \nwould also be included in the assessment of effects on the function and \npurpose of the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge as part of the Section \n4(f) analysis.\n    <bullet> Section 7: Both build alternatives would include tree \nremoval and potential impacts to the federally-endangered northern \nlong-eared bat and the proposed endangered tricolored bat.\n    <bullet> Flood plains: Portions of both build alternatives are \nwithin the 100-year flood plain, or base flood plain, so there is the \npotential for encroachments on flood plains.\n    <bullet> Community impacts: The improvements to existing Sandbridge \nRoad alternative have the potential for right-of-way impacts and \nrelocations. The Nimmo Parkway alternative is within right-of-way owned \nby the Project sponsor, the City of Virginia Beach, so right-of-way \nacquisition and relocations are not anticipated.\n    <bullet> Safety: Roadway safety would also be considered in the \nanalysis of alternatives, including the potential for wildlife-vehicle \ncollisions.\n    The EIS will evaluate the expected impacts and benefits to the \nknown resources above, as well as the following resources: Land use and \nright-of-way, farmland, social and community resources, economics, air \nquality, transportation, traffic noise, ecosystem resources (wildlife \nand threatened and endangered species), historic and cultural \nresources, hazardous waste sites, and visual resources. The level of \nreview of the identified resources for the EIS will be commensurate \nwith the anticipated effects to each resource from the proposed Project \nand will be governed by the statutory or regulatory requirements \nprotecting those resources.\n    The analyses and evaluations conducted for the EIS will identify \nthe potential for effects; avoidance measures; whether the anticipated \neffects would be adverse; and the appropriate environmental mitigation \nmeasures. Additional information on the expected impacts is provided in \nthe Additional Project Information Document available for review in the \ndocket established for this proposed Project and on the project website \nas noted in the ADDRESSES section.\n    Agencies, stakeholders, and the public are invited to comment on \nthe expected impacts. The environmental impact analysis will not begin \nuntil the Purpose and Need, Range of Alternatives, and impact \ncategories are finalized based on public comment on this notice. The \nidentification of impacts may be revised due to the consideration of \npublic comments. See the Additional Project Information Document for a \nmore detailed description of the Summary of Expected Impacts. The \nstudies to identify the impacts, as well as the analyses of impacts \nfrom the retained alternatives, will be presented in the Draft EIS.\n    Anticipated Permits and Other Authorizations. A Clean Water Act \nSection 404 permit decision from the USACE is anticipated on August 31, \n2027. Other likely Federal and State authorizations include the \nVirginia Marine Resources Commission (VRMC) Subaqueous Bottoms and \nTidal Wetlands Permit on March 31, 2027, a Virginia Department of \nEnvironmental Quality (VDEQ) Individual Permit on April 30, 2027, and a \nCoastal Zone Consistency Determination on June 1, 2027. Per U.S.C. \n139(d)(10), the aforementioned permits and authorizations should be \ncompleted by no later than 90 days after the issuance of the Record of \nDecision. The Project sponsor, the City of Virginia Beach, has \ncommitted to obtaining permits within 90 days of the issuance of the \nRecord of Decision.\n    Section 7 consultation under the Endangered Species Act is expected \nto be concluded on January 1, 2026, and Section 106 consultation under \nthe National Historic Preservation Act is anticipated to be concluded \non June 1, 2026. See the Additional Project Information Document for \nmore detail on the anticipated permits and other authorizations.\n    A Schedule for the Decision-Making Process. The Project schedule \nfollows the requirements of the environmental review process under 23 \nU.S.C. 139, which requires that environmental reviews for major \nprojects occur within agency average of 2 years (from the date of \npublication of the NOI) to the date of issuance of the ROD. Cooperating \nand Participating Agencies have reviewed the schedule and agencies with \npermitting or other authorizations, including USACE, VMRC, VDEQ, USFWS, \nand the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency, have confirmed the \nschedule is appropriate. Per 23 U.S.C. 139(d)(10), permits and \nauthorizations should be completed by no later than 90 days after the \nissuance of the Record of Decision. The Project\n\n[[Page 22155]]\n\nsponsor, the City of Virginia Beach, has committed to obtaining permits \nwithin 90 days of the issuance of the Record of Decision. Following the \nissuance of this notice, FHWA and VDOT will coordinate with the \nParticipating, Cooperating, and Cooperating/Concurring Agencies to \ndevelop study documentation and the Draft EIS.\n    <bullet> The Draft EIS is anticipated to be issued in September \n2025.\n    <bullet> The combined Final EIS and Record of Decision is \nanticipated in May 2027.\n    <bullet> A Section 404 permit decision from the USACE is expected \nin August 2027.\n    See the Additional Project Information Document for additional \nschedule details.\n\nDescription of the Public Scoping Process, Including Scoping Meetings\n\nOutreach Conducted During Development of the EA\n    In September 2018, the City of Virginia Beach held a Citizen \nInformation Meeting (CIM) to seek feedback from the public on the \nProject. More than 100 members of the public attended the CIM, and more \nthan 600 people completed a project survey online or via hard copy at \nthe CIM.\n    In Spring 2019, the City of Virginia Beach held a scoping meeting \nand send scoping letters to Federal and State agencies to request \nrelevant information and identify any key issues regarding potential \nenvironmental impacts. Six agencies provided comments.\n    In May 2022, the City of Virginia Beach held a public hearing to \npresent the preliminary Project design and the findings of the EA. More \nthan 300 public comments were received on the EA.\nAgency Scoping\n    In March 2024, as part of initial NEPA scoping to determine the \nclass of action, VDOT and FHWA identified agencies who would likely \nserve as Cooperating and Participating Agencies for the EIS. These \nagencies are largely the same entities involved in the preparation of \nthe Nimmo Parkway Phase VII-B EA.\n    Beginning in April 2024, VDOT and FHWA began to brief the likely \nCooperating and Participating Agencies on initial NEPA scoping \nactivities to support the development of the EIS.\n    Agency coordination up to this point has been conducted primarily \nthrough VDOT's monthly NEPA Agency Coordination Meeting. All likely \nCooperating and Participating Agencies are invited to attend the \nmonthly agency coordination meeting. A brief summary of agency \ncoordination is included below.\n\nApril 2024\n    <bullet> Introduction of the Project, including Project history\n    <bullet> Discussion of resource methodologies and preliminary \npurpose and need and range of alternatives\nMay 2024\n    <bullet> Discussion of agency comments on resource methodologies\n    <bullet> Discussion of preliminary purpose and need\nJune 2024\n    <bullet> Discussion of preliminary purpose and need and range of \nalternatives\nJuly 2024\n    <bullet> Discussion of preliminary range of alternatives and future \npermitting activities\nAugust 2024\n    <bullet> Discussion of preliminary range of alternatives\nSeptember 2024\n    <bullet> Preliminary concurrence from agencies on preliminary \npurpose and need and discussion of preliminary range of alternatives\nOctober 2024\n    <bullet> Discussion of preliminary range of alternatives\nNovember 2024\n    <bullet> Preliminary concurrence from agencies on preliminary range \nof alternatives\n\n    In accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139, an Agency Coordination Plan is \nbeing developed and will be finalized within 90 days of the issuance of \nthis NOI; the Agency Coordination Plan establishes a framework for \ncoordination among the Federal, State, local agencies participating and \nthe public in the development of the EIS.\n\nPublic Review\n\n    A 30-day comment period is being held in association with this NOI. \nAgencies and the public are invited to comment on the Environmental \nAnalysis Methodologies, Purpose and Need, and Range of Alternatives for \nthe proposed action.

What action is EPA proposing?\n\n    On March 19, 2009, Texas submitted a revision to its SIP to address \nregional haze for the first planning period (2009 Plan). Texas made \nthis SIP submission to satisfy the requirements of the CAA's regional \nhaze program pursuant to CAA sections 169A and 169B and 40 CFR 51.308. \nThe EPA is proposing to approve the portions of Texas's 2009 Plan which \nthe EPA previously disapproved related to certain reasonable progress \nrequirements under 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1) through (3).\\1\\ The disapproval \nwas subsequently vacated by the Fifth Circuit. The EPA is also \nproposing to approve the portions of Oklahoma's first planning period \nSIP that the State submitted in 2010 (2010 Plan) that address certain \nrequirements under 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1). EPA's disapproval of these \nportions of the Oklahoma plan was also vacated by the Fifth Circuit as \npart of the same action that vacated portions of our disapproval of \nTexas's 2009 Plan.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ The BART requirements for EGUs were disapproved in a \nseparate action in 2012. See 77 FR 33642 (June 7, 2012). EPA \npromulgated a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to address these \nrequirements in 2017 and revised it in 2020. See 82 FR 48324 \n(October 17, 2017) and 85 FR 49170 (Aug.12, 2020) As such this \naction does not address BART for EGUs in Texas.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On March 20, 2014, Texas submitted its five-year progress report as \na SIP revision (2014 Plan) to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR \n51.308(g) and (h). The EPA is proposing to approve Texas's 2014 Plan.\n    On July 20, 2021, Texas submitted a revision to its SIP to address \nregional haze for the second planning period (2021 Plan). Texas made \nthis SIP submission to satisfy the requirements of the CAA's regional \nhaze program pursuant to CAA sections 169A and 169B and 40 CFR 51.308. \nThe EPA is proposing to approve the 2021 Plan.\n\nII. Background and Regional Haze Rule Requirements\n\n    In the 1977 CAA Amendments, Congress created a program for \nprotecting visibility in the nation's mandatory Class I Federal areas, \nwhich include certain national parks and wilderness areas.\\2\\ The CAA \nestablishes as a national goal the ``prevention of any future, and the \nremedying of any existing, impairment of visibility in mandatory Class \nI Federal areas which impairment results from manmade air pollution.'' \n\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ CAA section 169A. Areas statutorily designated as mandatory \nClass I Federal areas consist of national parks exceeding 6,000 \nacres, wilderness areas and national memorial parks exceeding 5,000 \nacres, and all international parks that were in existence on August \n7, 1977. CAA section 162(a). There are 156 mandatory Class I areas. \nThe list of areas to which the requirements of the visibility \nprotection program apply is in 40 CFR part 81, subpart D.\n    \\3\\ CAA section 169A.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Regional haze is visibility impairment that is produced by a \nmultitude of anthropogenic sources and activities which are located \nacross a broad geographic area and that emit pollutants that impair \nvisibility. Visibility impairing pollutants include fine and coarse \nparticulate matter (PM) (e.g., sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, \nelemental carbon, and soil dust) and their precursors (e.g., sulfur \ndioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), and, in \nsome cases, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and ammonia \n(NH<INF>3</INF>)). Fine particle precursors react in the atmosphere to \nform fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>), which impairs \nvisibility by scattering and absorbing light. Visibility impairment \nreduces the\n\n[[Page 22167]]\n\nperception of clarity and color, as well as visible distance.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ There are several ways to measure the amount of visibility \nimpairment, i.e., haze. One such measurement is the deciview, which \nis the principal metric used by the RHR. Under many circumstances, a \nchange in one deciview will be perceived by the human eye to be the \nsame on both clear and hazy days. The deciview is unitless. It is \nproportional to the logarithm of the atmospheric extinction of \nlight, which is the perceived dimming of light due to its being \nscattered and absorbed as it passes through the atmosphere. \nAtmospheric light extinction (b\\ext\\) is a metric used for \nexpressing visibility and is measured in inverse megameters \n(Mm<SUP>-1</SUP>). Light extinction can be simpler to use in \ncalculations than deciviews, since it is not a logarithmic function. \nThe formula for the deciview is 10 ln (b\\ext\\)/10 Mm-1). 40 CFR \n51.301.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    To address regional haze visibility impairment, the 1999 RHR \nestablished an iterative planning process that requires both States in \nwhich Class I areas are located and states ``the emissions from which \nmay reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment \nof visibility'' in a Class I area to periodically submit SIP revisions \nto address such impairment. CAA section 169A(b)(2); \\5\\ see also 40 CFR \n51.308(b) and (f) (establishing submission dates for iterative regional \nhaze SIP revisions); 64 FR 35714, 35768 (July 1, 1999).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ The RHR expresses the statutory requirement for States to \nsubmit plans addressing out-of-State Class I areas by providing that \nStates must address visibility impairment ``in each mandatory Class \nI Federal area located outside the State that may be affected by \nemissions from within the State.'' 40 CFR 51.308(d) and (f).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. Regional Haze Rule Requirements for the First Planning Period\n\n    Much of the focus in the first implementation period of the \nregional haze program, which ran from 2007 through 2018, was on \nsatisfying States' Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) \nobligations. First implementation period SIPs were additionally \nrequired to contain long-term strategies for making reasonable progress \ntoward the national visibility goal, of which BART is one component. \nThe core required elements for the first implementation period SIPs \n(other than BART) are laid out in 40 CFR 51.308(d). Those provisions \nrequired that States containing Class I areas establish reasonable \nprogress goals (RPGs) that are measured in deciviews and reflect the \nanticipated visibility conditions at the end of the implementation \nperiod including from implementation of States' long-term strategies. \nThe first planning period RPGs were required to provide for an \nimprovement in visibility for the most impaired days over the period of \nthe implementation plan and ensure no degradation in visibility for the \nleast impaired days over the same period. In establishing the RPGs for \nany Class I area in a State, the State was required to consider four \nstatutory factors: the costs of compliance, the time necessary for \ncompliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of \ncompliance, and the remaining useful life of any potentially affected \nsources.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ CAA section 169A(g)(1); 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    States were also required to calculate baseline (using the five \nyear period of 2000-2004) and natural visibility conditions (i.e., \nvisibility conditions without anthropogenic visibility impairment) for \neach Class I area, and to calculate the linear rate of progress needed \nto attain natural visibility conditions, assuming a starting point of \nbaseline visibility conditions in 2004 and ending with natural \nconditions in 2064. This linear interpolation is known as the uniform \nrate of progress (URP) and is used as a tracking metric to help States \nassess the amount of progress they are making towards the national \nvisibility goal over time in each Class I area.\\7\\ The 1999 RHR also \nprovided that States' long-term strategies must include the \n``enforceable emissions limitations, compliance, schedules, and other \nmeasures as necessary to achieve the reasonable progress goals.'' \\8\\ \nIn establishing their long-term strategies, States are required to \nconsult with other States that also contribute to visibility impairment \nin a given Class I area and include all measures necessary to obtain \ntheir shares of the emission reductions needed to meet the RPGs.\\9\\ \nSection 51.308(d) also contains seven additional factors States must \nconsider in formulating their long-term strategies, 40 CFR \n51.308(d)(3)(v), as well as provisions governing monitoring and other \nimplementation plan requirements.\\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(i)(B) and (d)(2). The EPA established \nthe URP framework in the 1999 RHR to provide ``an equitable \nanalytical approach'' to assessing the rate of visibility \nimprovement at Class I areas across the country. The starting point \nfor the URP analysis is 2004 and the endpoint was calculated based \non the amount of visibility improvement that was anticipated to \nresult from implementation of existing CAA programs over the period \nfrom the mid-1990s to approximately 2005. Assuming this rate of \nprogress would continue into the future, the EPA determined that \nnatural visibility conditions would be reached in 60 years, or 2064 \n(60 years from the baseline starting point of 2004). However, the \nEPA did not establish 2064 as the year by which the national goal \nmust be reached. 64 FR 35714, 35731-32 (July 1, 1999). That is, the \nURP and the 2064 date are not enforceable targets but are rather \ntools that ``allow for analytical comparisons between the rate of \nprogress that would be achieved by the State's chosen set of control \nmeasures and the URP.'' 82 FR 3078, 3084 (January 10, 2017).\n    \\8\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3).\n    \\9\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3)(i) and (ii).\n    \\10\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Finally, the 1999 RHR required States to submit periodic progress \nreports--SIP revisions due every five years that contain information on \nStates' implementation of their regional haze plans and an assessment \nof whether anything additional is needed to make reasonable progress, \nsee 40 CFR 51.308(g) and (h)--and to consult with the Federal Land \nManager(s) \\11\\ (FLMs) responsible for each Class I area according to \nthe requirements in CAA section 169A(d) and 40 CFR 51.308(i).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ The EPA's regulations define ``Federal Land Manager'' as \n``the Secretary of the department with authority over the Federal \nClass I area (or the Secretary's designee) or, with respect to \nRoosevelt-Campobello International Park, the Chairman of the \nRoosevelt-Campobello International Park Commission.'' 40 CFR 51.301.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Regional Haze Rule Requirements for the Second Planning Period\n\n    On January 10, 2017, the EPA promulgated revisions to the RHR, (82 \nFR 3078, January 10, 2017), that apply for the second and subsequent \nimplementation periods. The reasonable progress requirements as revised \nin the 2017 rulemaking (referred to here as the 2017 RHR Revisions) are \ncodified at 40 CFR 51.308(f). For additional background on the 2017 RHR \nrevisions, please refer to section III of the preamble to the 2017 RHR \nrevisions.\\12\\ The following is an abbreviated history and background \nof the regional haze program and 2017 Regional Haze Rule as it applies \nto the current action.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ Section III of the 2017 RHR is titled ``Overview of \nVisibility Protection Statutory Authority, Regulation, and \nImplementation'' 82 FR 3078, 3081, January 10, 2017.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Under the CAA and EPA's regulations, all 50 States, the District of \nColumbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are required to submit regional \nhaze SIPs satisfying the applicable requirements for the second \nimplementation period of the regional haze program by July 31, 2021. \nEach State's SIP must contain a long-term strategy for making \nreasonable progress toward meeting the national goal of remedying any \nexisting and preventing any future anthropogenic visibility impairment \nin Class I areas.\\13\\ To this end, 40 CFR 51.308(f) lays out the \nprocess by which States determine what constitutes their long-term \nstrategies, with the order of the requirements in 40 CFR 51.308(f)(1) \nthrough (3) generally mirroring the order of the steps in the \nreasonable progress analysis \\14\\ and\n\n[[Page 22168]]\n\nparagraphs (f)(4) through (6) containing additional, related \nrequirements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ CAA section 169A(b)(2)(B).\n    \\14\\ The EPA explained in the 2017 RHR Revisions that we were \nadopting new regulatory language in 40 CFR 51.308(f) that, unlike \nthe structure in 51.308(d), ``tracked the actual planning \nsequence.'' (82 FR 3078, 3091, January 10, 2017).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Broadly speaking, a State first must identify the Class I areas \nwithin the State and determine the Class I areas outside the State in \nwhich visibility may be affected by emissions from the State. These are \nthe Class I areas that must be addressed in the State's long-term \nstrategy.\\15\\ For each Class I area within its borders, a State must \nthen calculate the baseline (five-year average period of 2000-2004), \ncurrent, and natural visibility conditions (i.e., visibility conditions \nwithout anthropogenic visibility impairment) for that area, as well as \nthe visibility improvement made to date and the ``uniform rate of \nprogress'' (URP).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See 40 CFR 51.308(f) and (f)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The URP is the linear rate of progress needed to attain natural \nvisibility conditions, assuming a starting point of baseline visibility \nconditions in 2004 and ending with natural conditions in 2064. This \nlinear interpolation is used as a tracking metric to help States assess \nthe amount of progress they are making towards the national visibility \ngoal over time in each Class I area.\\16\\ Each State having a Class I \narea and/or emissions that may affect visibility in a Class I area must \nthen develop a long-term strategy that includes the enforceable \nemission limitations, compliance schedules, and other measures that are \nnecessary to make reasonable progress in such areas. A reasonable \nprogress determination is based on applying the four factors in CAA \nsection 169A(g)(1) to sources of visibility impairing pollutants that \nthe State has selected to assess for controls for the second \nimplementation period. Additionally, as further explained below, the \nRHR at 40 CFR 51.3108(f)(2)(iv) separately provides five ``additional \nfactors'' \\17\\ that States must consider in developing their long-term \nstrategies.\\18\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ See 40 CFR 51.308(f)(1).\n    \\17\\ The five ``additional factors'' for consideration in 40 \nCFR51.308(f)(2)(iv) are distinct from the four factors listed in CAA \nsection 169A(g)(1) and 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) that States must \nconsider and apply to sources in determining reasonable progress.\n    \\18\\ See 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    A State evaluates potential emission reduction measures for those \nselected sources and determines which are necessary to make reasonable \nprogress. Those measures are then incorporated into the State's long-\nterm strategy. After a State has developed its long-term strategy, it \nthen establishes RPGs for each Class I area within its borders by \nmodeling the visibility impacts of all reasonable progress controls at \nthe end of the second implementation period, i.e., in 2028, as well as \nthe impacts of other requirements of the CAA. The RPGs include \nreasonable progress controls not only for sources in the State in which \nthe Class I area is located, but also for sources in other States that \ncontribute to visibility impairment in that area. The RPGs are then \ncompared to the baseline visibility conditions and the URP to ensure \nthat progress is being made towards the statutory goal of preventing \nany future and remedying any existing anthropogenic visibility \nimpairment in Class I areas.\\19\\ There are additional requirements in \nthe rule, including FLM consultation, that apply to all visibility \nprotection SIPs and SIP revisions.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2) and (3).\n    \\20\\ See e.g., 40 CFR 51.308(i).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    While States have discretion to choose any source selection \nmethodology that is reasonable, whatever choices they make should be \nreasonably explained. To this end, 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) requires that \na State's SIP submission include ``a description of the criteria it \nused to determine which sources or groups of sources it evaluated.'' \nThe technical basis for source selection, which may include methods for \nquantifying potential visibility impacts such as emissions divided by \ndistance metrics, trajectory analyses, residence time analyses, and/or \nphotochemical modeling, must also be appropriately documented, as \nrequired by 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iii). Once a State has selected the set \nof sources, the next step is to determine the emissions reduction \nmeasures for those sources that are necessary to make reasonable \nprogress for the second implementation period.\\21\\ This is accomplished \nby considering the four factors--``the costs of compliance, the time \nnecessary for compliance, and the energy and nonair quality \nenvironmental impacts of compliance, and the remaining useful life of \nany existing source subject to such requirements.'' \\22\\ The EPA has \nexplained that the four-factor analysis is an assessment of potential \nemission reduction measures (i.e., control options) for sources; ``use \nof the terms `compliance' and `subject to such requirements' in section \n169A(g)(1) strongly indicates that Congress intended the relevant \ndetermination to be the requirements with which sources would have to \ncomply to satisfy the CAA's reasonable progress mandate.'' \\23\\ Thus, \nfor each source it has selected for four-factor analysis,\\24\\ a State \nmust consider a ``meaningful set'' of technically feasible control \noptions for reducing emissions of visibility impairing pollutants.\\25\\ \nThe EPA has also explained that, in addition to the four statutory \nfactors, States have flexibility under the CAA and RHR to reasonably \nconsider visibility benefits as an additional factor alongside the four \nstatutory factors.\\26\\ Ultimately, while States have discretion to \nreasonably weigh the factors and to determine what level of control is \nneeded, 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) provides that a State ``must include in \nits implementation plan a description of . . . how the four factors \nwere taken into consideration in selecting the measure for inclusion in \nits long-term strategy.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ The CAA provides that, ``[i]n determining reasonable \nprogress there shall be taken into consideration'' the four \nstatutory factors. CAA section 169A(g)(1). However, in addition to \nfour-factor analyses for selected sources, groups of sources, or \nsource categories, a State may also consider additional emission \nreduction measures for inclusion in its long-term strategy, e.g., \nfrom other newly adopted, on-the-books, or on-the-way rules and \nmeasures for sources not selected for four-factor analysis for the \nsecond planning period.\n    \\22\\ CAA section 169A(g)(1).\n    \\23\\ 82 FR 3078, 3091 (January 10, 2017).\n    \\24\\ ``Each source'' or ``particular source'' is used here as \nshorthand. While a source-specific analysis is one way of applying \nthe four factors, neither the statute nor the RHR requires States to \nevaluate individual sources. Rather, States have ``the flexibility \nto conduct four-factor analyses for specific sources, groups of \nsources or even entire source categories, depending on State policy \npreferences and the specific circumstances of each State.'' 82 FR \n3078, 3088 (January 10, 2017).\n    \\25\\ Id. at 3088.\n    \\26\\ See, e.g., ``Responses to Comments on Protection of \nVisibility: Amendments to Requirements for State Plans; Proposed \nRule'' (December 2016), Docket Number EPA-HQ-OAR-2015-0531, U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency at 186.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As explained above, 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) requires States to \ndetermine the emission reduction measures for sources that are \nnecessary to make reasonable progress by considering the four factors. \nPursuant to 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2), measures that are necessary to make \nreasonable progress towards the national visibility goal must be \nincluded in a State's long-term strategy and in its SIP. If the outcome \nof a four-factor analysis is that an emissions reduction measure is \nnecessary to make reasonable progress towards remedying existing or \npreventing future anthropogenic visibility impairment, that measure \nmust be included in the SIP.\n    The characterization of information on each of the factors is also \nsubject to the documentation requirement in 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iii). \nThe reasonable progress analysis is a technically complex exercise, and \nalso a flexible one that provides States with bounded discretion to \ndesign and implement approaches appropriate to their circumstances. \nGiven this flexibility,\n\n[[Page 22169]]\n\n 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iii) plays an important function in requiring a \nState to document the technical basis for its decision making so that \nthe public and the EPA can comprehend and evaluate the information and \nanalysis the State relied upon to determine what emission reduction \nmeasures must be in place to make reasonable progress. The technical \ndocumentation must include the modeling, monitoring, cost, engineering, \nand emissions information on which the State relied to determine the \nmeasures necessary to make reasonable progress. Additionally, the RHR \nat 40 CFR 51.3108(f)(2)(iv) separately provides five ``additional \nfactors'' \\27\\ that States must consider in developing their long-term \nstrategies: (1) emission reductions due to ongoing air pollution \ncontrol programs, including measures to address reasonably attributable \nvisibility impairment; (2) measures to reduce the impacts of \nconstruction activities; (3) source retirement and replacement \nschedules; (4) basic smoke management practices for prescribed fire \nused for agricultural and wildland vegetation management purposes and \nsmoke management programs; and (5) the anticipated net effect on \nvisibility due to projected changes in point, area, and mobile source \nemissions over the period addressed by the long-term strategy.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\27\\ The five ``additional factors'' for consideration in 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)(iv) are distinct from the four factors listed in CAA \nsection 169A(g)(1) and 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) that States must \nconsider and apply to sources in determining reasonable progress.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Because the air pollution that causes regional haze crosses State \nboundaries, 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(ii) requires a State to consult with \nother States that also have emissions that are reasonably anticipated \nto contribute to visibility impairment in a given Class I area. If a \nState, pursuant to consultation, agrees that certain measures (e.g., a \ncertain emission limitation) are necessary to make reasonable progress \nat a Class I area, it must include those measures in its SIP.\\28\\ \nAdditionally, the RHR requires that States that contribute to \nvisibility impairment at the same Class I area consider the emission \nreduction measures the other contributing States have identified as \nbeing necessary to make reasonable progress for their own sources.\\29\\ \nIf a State has been asked to consider or adopt certain emission \nreduction measures, but ultimately determines those measures are not \nnecessary to make reasonable progress, that State must document in its \nSIP the actions taken to resolve the disagreement.\\30\\ Under all \ncircumstances, a State must document in its SIP submission all \nsubstantive consultations with other contributing States.\\31\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(ii)(A).\n    \\29\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(ii)(B).\n    \\30\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(ii)(C).\n    \\31\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(ii)(C).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Reasonable progress goals ``measure the progress that is projected \nto be achieved by the control measures States have determined are \nnecessary to make reasonable progress based on a four-factor \nanalysis.'' \\32\\ For the second implementation period, the RPGs are set \nfor 2028. Reasonable progress goals are not enforceable targets, 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(3)(iii). While States are not legally obligated to achieve \nthe visibility conditions described in their RPGs, 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(3)(i) requires that ``[t]he long-term strategy and the \nreasonable progress goals must provide for an improvement in visibility \nfor the most impaired days since the baseline period and ensure no \ndegradation in visibility for the clearest days since the baseline \nperiod.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ 82 FR 3078, 3091 (January 10, 2017).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    RPGs may also serve as a metric for assessing the amount of \nprogress a State is making towards the national visibility goal. To \nsupport this approach, the RHR requires States with Class I areas to \ncompare the 2028 RPG for the most impaired days to the corresponding \npoint on the URP line (representing visibility conditions in 2028 if \nvisibility were to improve at a linear rate from conditions in the \nbaseline period of 2000-2004 to natural visibility conditions in 2064). \nIf the most impaired days RPG in 2028 is above the URP (i.e., if \nvisibility conditions are improving more slowly than the rate described \nby the URP), each State that contributes to visibility impairment in \nthe Class I area must demonstrate, based on the four-factor analysis \nrequired under 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i), that no additional emission \nreduction measures would be reasonable to include in its long-term \nstrategy.\\33\\ To this end, section 51.308(f)(3)(ii) requires that each \nState contributing to visibility impairment in a Class I area that is \nprojected to improve more slowly than the URP provide ``a robust \ndemonstration, including documenting the criteria used to determine \nwhich sources or groups [of] sources were evaluated and how the four \nfactors required by paragraph (f)(2)(i) were taken into consideration \nin selecting the measures for inclusion in its long-term strategy.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\33\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(3)(ii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(6) requires States to have certain strategies and \nelements in place for assessing and reporting on visibility. Individual \nrequirements under this section apply either to States with Class I \nareas within their borders, States with no Class I areas but that are \nreasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment \nin any Class I area, or both. Compliance with the monitoring strategy \nrequirement may be met through a State's participation in the \nInteragency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) \nmonitoring network, which is used to measure visibility impairment \ncaused by air pollution at the 156 Class I areas covered by the \nvisibility program.\\34\\ All States' SIPs must provide for procedures by \nwhich monitoring data and other information are used to determine the \ncontribution of emissions from within the State to regional haze \nvisibility impairment in affected Class I areas, as well as a statewide \ninventory documenting such emissions.\\35\\ All States' SIPs must also \nprovide for any other elements, including reporting, recordkeeping, and \nother measures, that are necessary for States to assess and report on \nvisibility.\\36\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\34\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(6), (f)(6)(i) and (iv).\n    \\35\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(6)(ii), (iii), and (v).\n    \\36\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(6)(vi).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(5) requires a State's regional haze SIP revision \nto address the requirements of paragraphs 40 CFR 51.308(g)(1) through \n(5) so that the plan revision due in 2021 will serve also as a progress \nreport addressing the period since submission of the progress report \nfor the first implementation period. The regional haze progress report \nrequirement is designed to inform the public and the EPA about a \nState's implementation of its existing long-term strategy and whether \nsuch implementation is in fact resulting in the expected visibility \nimprovement.\\37\\ To this end, every State's SIP revision for the second \nimplementation period is required to assess changes in visibility \nconditions and describe the status of implementation of all measures \nincluded in the State's long-term strategy, including BART and \nreasonable progress emission reduction measures from the first \nimplementation period, and the resulting emissions reductions.\\38\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\37\\ See 81 FR 26942, 26950 (May 4, 2016), 82 FR 3078, 3119 \n(January 10, 2017).\n    \\38\\ 40 CFR 51.308(g)(1) and (2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Clean Air Act section 169A(d) requires that before a State holds a \npublic hearing on a proposed regional haze SIP revision, it must \nconsult with the appropriate FLM or FLMs; pursuant to that \nconsultation, the State must include a summary of the FLMs' conclusions \nand recommendations in\n\n[[Page 22170]]\n\nthe notice to the public. Consistent with this statutory requirement, \nthe RHR also requires that States ``provide the [FLM] with an \nopportunity for consultation, in person and at a point early enough in \nthe State's policy analyses of its long-term strategy emission \nreduction obligation so that information and recommendations provided \nby the [FLM] can meaningfully inform the State's decisions on the long-\nterm strategy.'' \\39\\ For the EPA to evaluate whether FLM consultation \nmeeting the requirements of the RHR has occurred, the SIP submission \nshould include documentation of the timing and content of such \nconsultation. The SIP revision submitted to the EPA must also describe \nhow the State addressed any comments provided by the FLMs.\\40\\ Finally, \na SIP revision must provide procedures for continuing consultation \nbetween the State and FLMs regarding the State's visibility protection \nprogram, including development and review of SIP revisions, five-year \nprogress reports, and the implementation of other programs having the \npotential to contribute to impairment of visibility in Class I \nareas.\\41\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\39\\ 40 CFR 51.308(i)(2).\n    \\40\\ 40 CFR 51.308(i)(3).\n    \\41\\ 40 CFR 51.308(i)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIII. What regional haze SIPs are being addressed in this proposal?\n\nA. Texas's First Planning Period SIP and Five-Year Progress Report SIP\n\n    Texas submitted its regional haze SIP for the first implementation \nperiod to the EPA on March 31, 2009 (2009 Plan). The EPA issued a \nlimited disapproval of Texas's 2009 Plan on June 7, 2012, due to its \nreliance on the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to address BART \nrequirements for Texas electric generating units (EGUs).\\42\\ Two years \nlater, the EPA proposed a rule to partially approve and partially \ndisapprove Texas's 2009 Plan on December 16, 2014; \\43\\ however, due to \na related ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit),\\44\\ the EPA could not \nfinalize the December 2014 proposal in its entirety. As such, the EPA's \nobligations for the first implementation period for Texas's regional \nhaze SIP were addressed in two separate actions.\\45\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\42\\ 77 FR 33642 (June 7, 2012).\n    \\43\\ 79 FR 74818 (December 16, 2014).\n    \\44\\ EME Homer City Generation, L.P v. EPA, 795 F.3d 118 (D.C. \nCir. 2015).\n    \\45\\ 81 FR 296 (January 5, 2016); 82 FR 48324 (October 17, \n2017), affirmed and supplemented in 85 FR 49170 (August 12, 2020).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    One action, finalized on January 5, 2016, addressed the first \nplanning period regional haze requirements in Texas except for BART \nrequirements for EGUs (2016 Final Rule).\\46\\ The 2016 Final Rule \npartially approved and partially disapproved Texas's 2009 Plan. \nSpecifically, we disapproved the following requirements:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\46\\ 81 FR 296 (January 5, 2016). In July 2016, the 5th Circuit \nCourt of Appeals issued a stay of the action. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d \n405 (5th Cir. 2016). Subsequent to the stay opinion, the EPA \nrequested and the court granted EPA's motion for a partial voluntary \nremand.\n\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(1)(i)(A), regarding Texas's \nreasonable progress four factor analysis.\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(1)(i)(B), regarding Texas's \ncalculation of the emission reductions needed to achieve the URPs \nfor the Guadalupe Mountains and Big Bend National Parks.\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(1)(ii), regarding Texas's RPGs for \nthe Guadalupe Mountains and Big Bend National Parks.\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(2)(iii), regarding Texas's \ncalculation of the natural visibility conditions for the Guadalupe \nMountains and Big Bend National Parks.\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(2)(iv)(A) regarding Texas's \ncalculation of natural visibility impairment.\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(i) regarding Texas's long-term \nstrategy consultation.\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(ii) regarding Texas securing its \nshare of reductions in other States' RPGs.\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(iii) regarding Texas's technical \nbasis for its long-term strategy.\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(v)(C), regarding Texas's emissions \nlimitations and schedules for compliance to achieve the RPGs.\n\n    We approved the 2009 Plan as to the other regional haze rule \nrequirements under 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1) through (4), 40 CFR 51.308(i), \nas well as Texas's BART determinations and BART rules for non-EGUs as \nrequired under 40 CFR 51.308(e). As discussed in more detail in section \nIII.B of this document, we also addressed an outstanding portion of \nOklahoma's first planning period SIP (2010 Plan) related to the \nrequirements under 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1) due to potential impacts from \nTexas sources on Oklahoma's Class I area. Specifically, we disapproved \nthe portion of Oklahoma's 2010 Plan that addressed 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1), \nwith the exception of the minimum progress requirement under 40 CFR \n51.308(d)(1)(vi), which we approved. To address the deficiencies in the \nSIPs, we also promulgated a FIP as part of the 2016 Final Rule that, \namong other things, established SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits for 15 \nEGUs located at eight coal-fired power plants in Texas.\n    The 2016 Final Rule was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit), and was stayed by the court on July \n15, 2016.\\47\\ In the court's published stay opinion, the court \ndetermined that the Petitioners in that case showed a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits that the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously \nin both its disapproval of a portion of Texas's 2009 Plan and also in \npromulgating a FIP to address said deficiencies, which included \nSO<INF>2</INF> emission limits on 15 units at eight coal-fired power \nplants in Texas. Considering the stay, the EPA requested a partial \nvoluntary remand of the 2016 Final Rule, which was granted by the Fifth \nCircuit on March 22, 2017.\\48\\ On July 26, 2023, the EPA proposed a \nrule to address the remanded 2016 Final Rule (2023 RP Proposal).\\49\\ In \nthe 2023 RP Proposal, the EPA proposed to disapprove the same portions \nof the Texas and Oklahoma SIPs which had been previously disapproved in \nthe 2016 Final Rule, in certain instances supplementing and clarifying \nour rationale for disapproval and, in others, incorporating our \noriginal bases for disapproval.\\50\\ Additionally, in the 2023 RP \nProposal, the EPA proposed to amend the FIP portion of the 2016 Final \nRule, by rescinding the control measures it previously promulgated for \n15 EGUs in Texas.\\51\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\47\\ Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 411 (5th Cir. 2016).\n    \\48\\ Texas v. EPA, Case No. 16-60118, Order (March 22, 2017).\n    \\49\\ 88 FR 48152 (July 26, 2023).\n    \\50\\ 88 FR 48152, 48159 (July 26, 2023).\n    \\51\\ 88 FR 48152, 48159 (July 26, 2023).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    During remand proceedings, notably while working to respond to the \npublic comments received on the 2023 Proposals, the EPA became aware \nthat key documents in the administrative record of the 2016 Final Rule \nwere no longer in the EPA's possession. As such, on September 3, 2024, \nthe EPA filed a motion for voluntary vacatur, acknowledging that the \nadministrative record no longer contained information required by the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Clean Air Act for judicial \nreview of the EPA's partial SIP disapprovals and FIPs.\\52\\ The Fifth \nCircuit granted the EPA's motion for partial voluntary vacatur on \nDecember 17, 2024, vacating the SIP disapproval and FIP portions of the \n2016 Final Rule.\\53\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\52\\ Respondents' Motion for Voluntary Vacatur, Texas v. EPA, \nCase No. 16-60118 (September 3, 2024).\n    \\53\\ Texas v. EPA, Case No. 16-60118, Order (December 17, 2024). \nBecause the EPA's motion for vacatur was specific to the SIP \ndisapprovals and the FIPs and the Fifth Circuit granted this motion, \nthe court vacated the disapproval and FIP portions of the 2016 Final \nRule, leaving the approvals intact. Thus, we are leaving our prior \napprovals in place and not reconsidering or reopening those \ndeterminations in this action.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22171]]\n\n    The second action, finalized on October 17, 2017, and affirmed and \nsupplemented on August 12, 2020, promulgated a FIP to address the BART \nrequirements for Texas EGUs for which we disapproved back in 2012.\\54\\ \nThe FIP established an intrastate SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program that \nserved to satisfy SO<INF>2</INF> BART requirements for Texas EGUs and \nrelied on CSAPR participation as a NO<INF>X</INF> BART alternative for \nTexas EGUs. The EPA is not addressing BART requirements for Texas EGUs \nin this action.\\55\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\54\\ See 82 FR 48324 (October 17, 2017); 85 FR 49170 (August 12, \n2020).\n    \\55\\ In 2023, the EPA proposed to reconsider its 2020 BART FIP \nfor EGUs. See 88 FR 28918 (May 4, 2023). The proposed 2023 has not \nbeen finalized and the 2020 final FIP is still in place.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On March 24, 2014, Texas submitted its five-year progress report as \na SIP revision (2014 Plan) under 40 CFR 51.308(g) and (h). The EPA is \nsubject to a consent decree deadline of December 15, 2026, to act on \nTexas's 2014 Plan.\\56\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\56\\ Our Children's Earth Foundation v. Regan, Case 1:23-CV-\n02848, Consent Decree (May 31, 2024).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB. Oklahoma's First Planning Period SIP\n\n    Oklahoma submitted its regional haze SIP revision on February 19, \n2010 (2010 Plan). We finalized a partial approval and partial \ndisapproval of that submittal on December 28, 2011, but did not act on \nthe portions of the SIP that addressed reasonable progress as required \nby 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1). We deferred consideration of the reasonable \nprogress requirements because to properly assess whether Oklahoma had \nsatisfied these requirements, we first needed to evaluate and act upon \nthe regional haze SIP revision submitted by the State of Texas.\\57\\ On \nDecember 16, 2014, we proposed to disapprove the portion of the \nOklahoma regional haze SIP that addressed 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1), with the \nexception of the minimum progress requirement under 40 CFR \n51.308(d)(1)(vi), which we approved.\\58\\ The disapproval stemmed from \nconsideration of impacts from Texas sources in establishing the \nreasonable progress goals for Wichita Mountains. In that same proposed \naction, we proposed a FIP for both Texas and Oklahoma. Specific to \nOklahoma, the FIP proposed to reset Oklahoma's RPGs based on our \nproposed finding that the controls we proposed for the Texas FIP also \nserved to cure the defects in these sections of Oklahoma's regional \nhaze SIP as well, thus satisfying the FIP obligation stemming from our \nproposed disapproval of portions of the Oklahoma SIP. The proposed \npartial disapproval and FIP for Oklahoma were finalized with our \nconcurrent FIP for Texas (2016 Final Rule).\\59\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\57\\ 76 FR 81728 (December 28, 2011). In this earlier action, we \nalso disapproved the SO<INF>2</INF> BART determinations for six EGUs \nat three power plants in Oklahoma and promulgated a FIP that \nestablished SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits for these EGUs. \nSubsequently, we approved a SIP revision from Oklahoma addressing \nthe BART requirements for two EGUs at one power plant and removed \nthe FIP requirements for this facility. 79 FR 12944 (March 7, 2014).\n    \\58\\ 79 FR 74818 (December 16, 2014).\n    \\59\\ 81 FR 296 (January 5, 2016).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    However, as discussed in section III.A. of this document, the Fifth \nCircuit granted the EPA's motion for voluntary vacatur on December 17, \n2024, vacating the SIP disapprovals and FIP portions of the 2016 Final \nRule for Oklahoma and Texas.\\60\\ Because the EPA's 2016 Final Rule SIP \ndisapprovals and FIPs were vacated, the EPA now has an outstanding \nobligation to act on those portions of Oklahoma's first planning period \nSIP that address 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1), with the exception of 40 CFR \n51.308(d)(1)(vi) which we previously approved. We provide our \nevaluation of those requirements in section V.B of this document.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\60\\ Texas v. EPA, Case No. 16-60118, Order (December 17, 2024).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC. Texas's Second Planning Period SIP\n\n    In accordance with CAA sections 169A and the RHR at 40 CFR \n51.308(f) and (i), on July 20, 2021, Texas submitted a SIP revision to \naddress its regional haze obligations for the second implementation \nperiod, which runs through 2028 (2021 Plan). Texas made its 2021 Plan \navailable for public comment on October 9, 2020. Texas received and \nresponded to public comments and included the comments and responses to \nthose comments in their submission.\n\nIV. Withdrawal of the 2023 RP Proposed Disapprovals\n\n    As previously discussed, EPA's 2016 Final Rule SIP disapprovals and \nFIPs were vacated by the Fifth Circuit. Therefore, the EPA now has an \noutstanding obligation to act on those portions of Texas's first \nplanning period SIP, which we are proposing to act on in this action. \nThe 2016 Final Rule also disapproved Oklahoma's RPGs for the Wichita \nMountains and disapproved the portions of the Oklahoma SIP addressing \nthe requirements of section 51.308(d)(1) regarding setting RPGs, with \nthe exception of section 51.308(d)(1)(iv). Because the Fifth Circuit's \norder vacated the SIP disapprovals and FIPs, the EPA's 2023 RP Proposal \ncan no longer stand, as that proposed action either relied upon the \n2016 Final Rule or proposed to modify portions of the rule that have \nsince been vacated by the court. As such, the EPA is now proposing to \nwithdraw the 2023 proposed disapprovals. Commenters who would like the \nEPA to consider any comments submitted on the 2023 RP Proposal, 88 FR \n48152 (July 26, 2023), must resubmit such comments during the comment \nperiod for this proposed action.\\61\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\61\\ The rulemaking docket for the now withdrawn action is \navailable under Docket ID EPA-R06-OAR-2014-0754 at \n<a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nV. The EPA's Evaluation and Proposed Action on The First Planning \nPeriod Regional Haze SIPs\n\n    In this action, we are proposing to approve those portions of the \nTexas and Oklahoma first planning period SIPs that were vacated by the \nFifth Circuit. Specifically, the EPA is now acting on the portions of \nthe Texas 2009 Plan SIP addressing the following requirements:\n\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(1)(i)(A) and 51.308(d)(1)(ii), \nregarding Texas's consideration of the four statutory factors in \nestablishing its reasonable progress goals for the Guadalupe \nMountains and Big Bend National Parks;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(1)(i)(B), regarding Texas's \ncalculation of the emission reductions needed to achieve the uniform \nrates of progress for the Guadalupe Mountains and Big Bend National \nParks;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(2)(iii), regarding Texas's \ncalculation of natural visibility conditions for the Guadalupe \nMountains and Big Bend National Parks;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(2)(iv)(A), regarding Texas's \ncalculation of the number of deciviews by which baseline conditions \nexceed natural visibility conditions for the Guadalupe Mountains and \nBig Bend National Parks;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(i), regarding consultation \nrequirements with other States where emissions from Texas are \nreasonably anticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in any \nClass I area located in another State or States;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(ii), regarding Texas securing its \nshare of reductions necessary to achieve the reasonable progress \ngoals at impacted Class I areas in other States;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(iii), regarding Texas's \ndocumentation of its technical basis for which it is relying on to \ndetermine its apportionment of emission reductions necessary for \nthose Class I areas in other States for which it affects; and\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(v)(C), regarding Texas's emission \nlimitations and schedules for compliance to achieve the reasonable \nprogress goals.\n\n    Similarly, we are also addressing the portion of Oklahoma's first \nplanning period SIP addressing section\n\n[[Page 22172]]\n\n51.308(d)(1) \\62\\ which we previously disapproved.\\63\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\62\\ Excluding the portion addressing section 51.308(d)(1)(vi), \nwhich we previously approved.\n    \\63\\ 79 FR 74818 (December 16, 2014).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In support of this proposed action, the EPA's evaluation takes into \naccount the requirements of the CAA and RHR, and the published stay \nopinion from the Fifth Circuit which outlined that Petitioners had a \nstrong likelihood of success on the merits in showing that EPA was \narbitrary and capricious and exceeded its statutory authority in \npartially disapproving the Texas and Oklahoma plans and replacing \nportions of them with a FIP. Because Texas considered the four factors \nand otherwise met the outstanding first planning period rule \nrequirements contained in section 51.308(d), we are now proposing \napproval of Texas's 2009 Plan. Approval of the 2009 SIP is further \nwarranted due to BART obligations for EGUs that have been addressed \nsince 2017 and affirmed in 2020.\\64\\ The EPA also notes that emission \nreductions and improvements in visibility have far exceeded the \nreductions and improvements contemplated in the 2009 Plan and that the \nFifth Circuit weighed the improvements in monitored visibility \nexceeding the goals in its 2016 stay opinion. Finally, because our \nprevious disapproval of portions of Oklahoma's 2010 Plan were largely \ncontingent on our disapproval of portions of Texas's 2009 Plan, we are \nalso proposing to approve the portion of Oklahoma's 2010 Plan that \naddresses section 51.308(d)(1).\\65\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\64\\ See 82 FR 48324 (October 17, 2017); 85 FR 49170 (August 12, \n2020).\n    \\65\\ Excluding the portion addressing section 51.308(d)(1)(vi), \nwhich we previously approved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. Texas's 2009 Plan\n\n1. Calculations of Natural Visibility Conditions and Uniform Rate of \nProgress\n    As required by section 51.308(d)(2)(i) and (iii) of the Regional \nHaze Rule, and in accordance with EPA's 2003 Natural Visibility \nGuidance,\\66\\ Texas calculated baseline (which were current at the \ntime) \\67\\ and natural visibility conditions for its two Class I areas, \nBig Bend National Park (Big Bend) and Guadalupe Mountains National Park \n(Guadalupe Mountains), on the most impaired and least impaired days. \nThe EPA previously found that Texas satisfied the requirement under 40 \nCFR 51.308(d)(2)(i) to calculate baseline visibility conditions, and as \nstated earlier in this action, we are not reconsidering or reopening \nthat determination. The EPA is now proposing to approve Texas's 2009 \nPlan, including the requirement to calculate natural visibility \nconditions under 40 CFR 51.308(d)(2)(iii). Additionally, and stemming \nfrom the approval of Texas's calculation of natural visibility \nconditions, the EPA is proposing to find that Texas satisfied the \nrequirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(2)(iv)(A) \\68\\ with respect to the \ncalculation of natural visibility impairment at Big Bend and Guadalupe \nMountains and 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(i)(B) for calculating the uniform \nrate of improvement (URP) for Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\66\\ Guidance for Estimating Natural Visibility Conditions Under \nthe Regional Haze Rule, EPA-454/B-03-005, September 2003.\n    \\67\\ Because this was the first planning period of the regional \nhaze program, baseline visibility conditions and current visibility \nconditions were the same.\n    \\68\\ In the 2017 RHR Revision, the EPA modified the regulation \ncontaining the requirement for States to calculate natural \nvisibility conditions. The requirement under 40 CFR \n51.308(d)(2)(iv)(A) is now found at 40 CFR 51.308(d)(2)(iv).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Under 40 CFR 51.308(d)(2)(iii), States must determine natural \nvisibility conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days for \nthe Class I areas located in the State. While the Regional Haze Rule \nrequires States to calculate natural visibility conditions for those \nClass I areas located in the State, the rule does not require that \nnatural visibility conditions be calculated in a specific manner, thus \nproviding States with discretion so long as that discretion is \nreasonable. The rule simply requires that States base such calculations \non available monitoring information and appropriate data analysis \ntechniques. To assist States in calculating natural visibility \nconditions, the EPA issued guidance that provided default natural \nconditions for the 20% most impaired and 20% least impaired days for \neach Class I area based on the original IMPROVE equation. However, the \nguidance also explained that States are allowed to use a ``refined'' \napproach or alternative approaches to the guidance defaults to estimate \nthe values that characterize the natural visibility conditions of their \nClass I areas.\\69\\ The default natural conditions in our 2003 guidance \nwere updated by the Natural Haze Levels II Committee utilizing the new \nIMPROVE equation and included some refinements to the estimates for the \nPM components.\\70\\ These estimates are referred to as the ``NC II'' \ndefault natural visibility conditions. Texas started with this refined \nversion of default natural visibility conditions, but altered the \nparameters concerning the contributions of coarse mass and fine soil by \nassuming that 100% of the fine soil and coarse mass concentrations in \nthe baseline period should be attributed to natural causes and that the \ncorresponding estimates in the NC II values should be replaced.\\71\\ For \nthe 20% most impaired days, the TCEQ calculated natural visibility \nconditions for Big Bend and the Guadalupe Mountains of 10.09 dv and \n12.26 dv, respectively. For the 20% least impaired days, the TCEQ \ncalculated that natural visibility conditions for Big Bend and the \nGuadalupe Mountains of 2.19 dv, and 2.10 dv, respectively.\\72\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\69\\ Guidance for Estimating Natural Visibility Conditions Under \nthe Regional Haze Rule, EPA-454/B-03-005, September 2003).\n    \\70\\ This information is included in our docket for this action \nand is also available at <a href=\"https://vista.cira.colostate.edu/Improve/rhr-archived-data/\">https://vista.cira.colostate.edu/Improve/rhr-archived-data/</a>.\n    \\71\\ 2009 Texas Regional Haze Plan, at 5-5--5-6.\n    \\72\\ 2009 Texas Regional Haze Plan, at 5-3--5-6.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Texas's 2009 Plan included an appendix with technical documents to \nsupport its decision to assume that 100% of the fine soil and coarse \nmass concentrations should be attributed to natural sources. These \nrobust technical documents provided a detailed analysis and explanation \nof the land cover of the surrounding desert landscape, which consists \nprimarily of highly erodible soils; the prevalence of dust storms; the \ngeneral lack of potential anthropogenic sources of coarse mass and soil \nin the area surrounding the Class I areas; and the fact that the \nmonitors, especially the Big Bend monitor, are located in areas that \nhave restrictions in place to minimize human impact on its desert \nenvironment.\\73\\ For these reasons, we propose to find that Texas's \nrefined calculation of natural visibility conditions for both Big Bend \nand Guadalupe Mountains was reasonable and well within the discretion \nafforded to States in developing SIPs.\\74\\ Furthermore, Texas points \nout that, consistent with the approach followed for the first planning \nperiod--which focused on the 20% haziest days rather than the 20% of \ndays with the greatest anthropogenic visibility impairment as EPA now \nrequires for second planning period and subsequent SIPs--the 20% \nhaziest days may involve days in which natural sources of visibility \nimpairment play a large factor.\\75\\ Thus, it is not\n\n[[Page 22173]]\n\nunreasonable for Texas to assume that given the surrounding desert \nlandscape and scarcity of anthropogenic sources that natural sources of \nfine soil and coarse mass dominated visibility impairment. Accordingly, \nwe are proposing to approve Texas's calculation of natural visibility \nconditions as required by 40 CFR 51.308(d)(2)(iii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\73\\ See Texas's 2009 Plan, appendix 5-2.\n    \\74\\ Texas's 2009 Plan also notes that to the extent its \napproach over-estimates the percentage of coarse mass and fine soil \nthat is natural, the approach it relied on to estimate organic \ncarbon is likely an underestimation and thus more than compensate \nfor any over-estimation in coarse mass or fine soil. See 2009 Plan, \nappendix 5-2.\n    \\75\\ As explained in the 2017 revisions to the RHR, the approach \nfollowed for the first implementation period involved selecting the \nleast and most impaired days as the monitored days with the lowest \nand highest actual deciview levels regardless of the source of the \nparticulate matter causing the visibility impairment. While the EPA \napproved SIPs using this approach for the first implementation \nperiod, the 2017 revisions to the RHR explained that for the most \nimpaired days an approach focusing on anthropogenic impairment is \nmore appropriate because it will more effectively track whether \nstates are making progress in controlling anthropogenic sources. \nBecause the 1999 RHR rule text already refers to the 20 percent most \nimpaired days, we did not propose to change that wording. In the \npreamble to the proposal, we made clear that going forward, we would \ninterpret ``most impaired days'' to mean those with the greatest \nanthropogenic visibility impairment, as opposed to the 20 percent \nhaziest days. 82 FR 3078, 3101 (January 10, 2017).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(d)(2)(iv)(A) requires States to calculate the number \nof dv by which baseline conditions exceed natural visibility conditions \nfor the most impaired and least impaired days for each Class I area \nlocated within the State. The natural visibility impairment is \ncalculated by subtracting the natural visibility calculation from the \nbaseline visibility calculation. In Chapter 5 of the 2009 Plan, Texas \ncalculated the number of dv by which baseline conditions exceed natural \nvisibility conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days and \nat Big Bend and the Guadalupe Mountains.

Also, in establishing its RPGs, States \nmust consider the uniform rate of improvement in visibility and the \nemission reduction measures needed to achieve it for the period covered \nby the SIP. To calculate this rate of progress, the State must compare \nbaseline visibility conditions to natural visibility conditions in the \nmandatory Federal Class I area and determine the uniform rate of \nvisibility improvement (measured in deciviews) that would need to be \nmaintained during each implementation period to attain natural \nvisibility conditions by 2064. The TCEQ analyzed and determined the URP \nneeded to reach natural visibility conditions by the year 2064. Also, \nin establishing its RPGs, the TCEQ considered the uniform rate of \nimprovement in visibility and the emission reduction measures needed to \nachieve this rate for the period covered by the SIP. In Chapter 10 of \nthe 2009 Plan, Texas compared the baseline visibility conditions to the \nnatural visibility conditions for Big Bend and the Guadalupe Mountains, \nand determined the URP needed to attain natural visibility conditions \nby 2064.\\76\\ The TCEQ constructed the URP by plotting a straight \ngraphical line from the baseline level of visibility impairment to the \nlevel of visibility conditions representing natural conditions in 2064 \nfor both Big Bend and the Guadalupe Mountains.\\77\\ The first benchmark \nyear is 2018 and the calculated improvement required to attain the \ndesired rate of progress is 1.7 dv for Big Bend and 1.2 dv for \nGuadalupe Mountains.\\78\\ Using the baseline visibility values and \nnatural visibility values discussed above, the TCEQ calculated the URP \nfor Big Bend to be 0.12 dv/year, and that for the Guadalupe Mountains \nto be 0.08 dv/yr.\\79\\ The information is summarized in the table below:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\76\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-1--10-3.\n    \\77\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-1--10-3\n    \\78\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-1--10-3.\n    \\79\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-1--10-3.\n\n[[Page 22174]]\n\n\n\n           Table 2--Texas Summary of Uniform Rate of Progress\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             Guadalupe\n            Visibility metric              Big bend (dv)  mountains (dv)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseline Conditions.....................           17.30           17.19\nNatural Visibility......................           10.09           12.26\nTotal Improvement by 2064...............            7.21            4.93\nUniform Rate of Progress (dv/year)......            0.12            0.08\nImprovement Needed by 2018..............             1.7             1.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The EPA finds Texas's analysis to be reasonable. Therefore, because \nTexas correctly followed the procedures for analyzing and determining \nthe rate of progress needed to attain natural visibility conditions by \nthe year 2064 consistent with the requirements of the Regional Haze \nRule, the EPA is proposing to approve Texas's calculation of the rate \nof progress needed to attain natural visibility conditions by the year \n2064 as required by 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(i)(B).\n    Additionally, in Chapter 10 of the 2009 Plan, Texas provided a \ntable showing the additional improvement needed to meet the uniform \nrate of progress for the planning period covered and the estimated \nemission reductions necessary to achieve it.\\80\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\80\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-10. We note that the table provided in \nTexas's 2009 Plan appears to reflect estimates of visibility \nbenefits from an earlier draft of the Texas Regional Haze SIP. In \nthat draft SIP, the TCEQ estimated the visibility benefit from a \ncertain set of controls to be 0.05 dv at each Class I area. Updating \nthese calculations with TCEQ's final estimation of the visibility \nbenefit from the TCEQ control set of 0.16 dv at Big Bend and 0.22 dv \nat Guadalupe Mountains yields revised amounts of 1,100,000 tons of \nSO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> reductions at a cost of \n$2,000,000,000 for Big Bend, and 250,000 tons of SO<INF>2</INF> and \nNO<INF>X</INF> reductions at a cost of $440,000,000 for Guadalupe \nMountains. 2009 Plan, at 10-6, 10-9 to 10-10.

RPGs and Visibility Improvements\n    Under 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1), States with Class I areas are required \nto establish goals that provide for reasonable progress toward \nachieving natural visibility conditions. In establishing an RPG, a \nState must consider the four statutory factors outlined in CAA Section \n169(A)(g)(1), ``the costs of compliance, the time necessary for \ncompliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of \ncompliance, and the remaining useful life of any potentially affected \nsources,'' and include a demonstration showing how these factors were \ntaken into consideration in selecting the goal.'' The reasonable \nprogress goals established by the State must provide for an improvement \nin visibility for the most impaired days over the period of the \nimplementation plan and ensure no degradation in visibility for the for \nleast impaired days over the same period.\n    As required by 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1), Texas established reasonable \nprogress goals (RPGs) for its two Class I areas, Big Bend and Guadalupe \nMountains. In Chapter 10 of its SIP, Texas explained that its RPGs were \nderived from the CENRAP \\81\\ modeling and reflect emissions reductions \nprograms already in place, including assumed reductions under the Clean \nAir Interstate Rule (CAIR) \\82\\ and additional refinery SO<INF>2</INF> \nreductions as a result of EPA's refinery consent decrees. The following \ntables summarize the RPGs Texas established for its two Class I \nareas.\\83\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\81\\ The Central States Air Resource Agencies (CenSARA) is a \nregional planning organization (RPO) that was created in 1995 and \ncurrently includes as members the States of Texas, Oklahoma, \nLouisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, as well \nas the federally recognized tribes within the boundaries of these \nStates. CenSARA created the Central Regional Air Planning \nAssociation (CENRAP) to coordinate activities associated with the \nmanagement of regional haze issues within the member States and \ntribes. However, CENRAP has since been abolished and CenSARA \ncurrently conducts regional haze and other air quality planning \nactivities for the CenSARA States. Since CENRAP was the entity which \nconducted technical analyses during the first planning period, this \nnotice references CENRAP when discussing Texas's 2009 Plan and \nOklahoma's 2010 Plan.\n    \\82\\ CAIR required certain States, including Texas, to reduce \nemissions of SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> that significantly \ncontribute to downwind nonattainment of the 1997 NAAQS for fine \nparticulate matter and ozone.

The TCEQ established a RPG of 16.6 dv for Big \nBend and 16.3 dv for Guadalupe Mountains for the 20% most impaired days \nfor 2018. This represents a 0.7 dv and 0.9 dv improvement in visibility \nover the baseline conditions at Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains, \nrespectively.\n    As part of establishing the RPGs for Big Bend and Guadalupe \nMountains in its first planning period SIP revision, Texas conducted a \ncontrol strategy analysis to inform its consideration of the four \nstatutory factors. As part of its analysis, Texas assessed the costs of \npotential controls and reductions for Texas point sources at ten Class \nI areas, including the two Texas Class I areas and those in nearby \nStates, such as the Wichita Mountains Wilderness Area (Wichita \nMountains) in Oklahoma. Texas focused its control strategy analysis on \nemissions of SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> from point sources. \nTexas focused on point sources of SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> as \nthese sources are the main anthropogenic pollutants that affect \nvisibility at Class I areas in Texas based on source apportionment \nmodeling conducted by CENRAP.\\84\\ Having narrowed the scope of the \ncontrol analysis to emissions of SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> from \npoint sources, Texas then developed a list of potential controls and \ncosts associated with those controls to inform the four-factor \nanalysis, using the CENRAP control strategy analysis as the starting \npoint.\\85\\ Texas adjusted CENRAP's analysis for Texas sources based on \nadditional information and past experience. Texas also added some \nadditional carbon black sources, which were not included in the CENRAP \nanalysis. This work resulted in a list of potential add-on controls for \nreducing SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> at Texas point sources. \nSources with potential control strategy costs greater than $2,700 per \nton SO<INF>2</INF> or NO<INF>X</INF> were initially screened out to \nlimit the population to potential sources with relatively cost-\neffective control strategies. Then, to better capture the point sources \nthat the State believed were likely to contribute to visibility \nimpairment at Class I areas, Texas screened out potential controls and \nsources using several different methods including a Q/d \\86\\ (using \nestimated projected 2018 base annual emissions) of less than five, an \narea of influence (AOI) analysis, and any source with predicted 2018 \nemissions of less than 100 tons per year.\\87\\ The final list of sources \nand potential controls resulted in the evaluation of SO<INF>2</INF> \ncontrols at 13 facilities \\88\\ and NO<INF>X</INF> controls at 15 \nfacilities.\\89\\ Further information about the types of controls \nconsidered, as well as the associated emission reductions and costs are \ndetailed in appendix 10-1 of Texas's 2009 Plan.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\84\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-2; appendix 10-1.\n    \\85\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-4.; 2009 Plan, appendix 10-1. CENRAP \ncontracted with Alpine Geophysics to conduct an evaluation of \npossible additional point-source add-on controls for sources in \nCENRAP States. The Alpine Geophysics evaluation relied on AirControl \nNET, a database tool the EPA released in 2006 to enable cost benefit \nanalyses of potential emissions control measures and strategies. \nAlpine Geophysics prepared cost estimates for potential add-on \ncontrols for NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> reductions in 2005 \ndollars for point sources in CENRAP States.\n    \\86\\ Q/d is the ratio of annual emissions of a given pollutant \nover distance to a Class I area and can be used to identify those \nsources with the largest potential to impact visibility.\n    \\87\\ Texas also excluded additional NO<INF>X</INF> controls on \ncement kilns from consideration, as it concluded it had already \nrequired all the measures it had determined reasonable to control \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions from these sources in the latest Dallas-\nFort Worth ozone SIP revision.\n    \\88\\ SO<INF>2</INF> sources considered were Sommers Deely \nSpruce, Bryans Mill Plant, Big Brown, Coleto Creek Plant, Chemical \nManufacturing, Deer Park Plant, Houston Plant, Como Plant, Waha \nPlant, Monticello, and three carbon black facilities (Big Spring, \nBorger, and Echo).\n    \\89\\ NO<INF>X</INF> sources considered were Sommers Deely \nSpruce, Texarkana Mill, Guadalupe Compressor Station, Fayette Power \nProject, Big Brown, Pampa Plant, Chemical Manufacturing, Tolk, \nLimestone, Sandow, Guardian Industries, Harrington Station, Martin \nLake, Monticello, and Works No. 4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Texas then calculated the total cost of SO<INF>2</INF> and \nNO<INF>X</INF> controls and the resulting emission reductions by \nsumming the individual costs of the identified controls. Texas's \ncontrol set for SO<INF>2</INF> had an estimated cost of approximately \n$270,800,000 and a projected reduction of 155,873 tpy. Texas's control \nset for NO<INF>X</INF> point sources had an estimated cost of \n$53,500,000 and a projected reduction of 27,132 tpy. Using CENRAP's \nmodeling as a starting point, Texas also estimated the additional \nvisibility benefit that would result in 2018 from controlling the \nsources it identified. The additional visibility benefit considered by \nTexas was beyond that already accounted for in the CENRAP modeling for \n2018, which included the on-the-books controls, including CAIR/BART, \nfor each State in the CENRAP region.\n    Using the above control strategy analysis, Texas then considered \nand weighed the four statutory factors in determining the \nreasonableness of additional controls and selecting the RPGs for Big \nBend and Guadalupe Mountains. As part of the four-factor analysis, \nTexas identified the cost of compliance as the key factor.\\90\\ With \nrespect to the cost of compliance, Texas found that at a total \nestimated cost of over $300 million and with no perceptible visibility \nbenefit, it was not reasonable to implement any additional \ncontrols.\\91\\ While visibility is not an explicitly listed factor to \nconsider when determining whether additional controls are reasonable, \nthe purpose of the four-factor analysis is to determine what degree of \nprogress toward natural visibility conditions is reasonable. Texas \nnoted that the time necessary for compliance was not a critical factor \nfor the determination of applicable additional controls for Texas \nsources, and that to the extent energy impacts were quantifiable for a \nparticular control, they were included in its cost estimates.\\92\\ \nAdditionally, Texas did not assume any limited useful equipment \nlife.\\93\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\90\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-7.\n    \\91\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-7.\n    \\92\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-8.\n    \\93\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-8.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The RPGs established by Texas provided for an improvement in \nvisibility conditions for the most impaired days over the first \nplanning period and ensured no degradation in visibility for the least \nimpaired days over the same period. Additionally, Texas's SIP included \na demonstration showing how these factors were taken into consideration \nin selecting the goal. As outlined in the Fifth Circuit's 2016 stay \nopinion, the court determined that Petitioners had a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits in demonstrating that the EPA's prior disapproval \nof Texas's 2009 Plan and the EPA's FIP was unreasonable and thus \narbitrary and capricious. We therefore find Texas's decision to focus \nthe analysis of the four statutory factors on emissions of \nNO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> from point sources to be reasonable, \nas the CENRAP modeling results and the TCEQ's analysis in Chapter 11 \nand appendix 10-1 of the Texas 2009 Plan indicate that the predominant \nanthropogenic pollutants that affect Texas Class I areas are largely \ndue to sulfate and nitrate, primarily from point sources. We also find \nthat TCEQ adequately considered the four factors. Neither the CAA nor \nthe RHR rule specify the specific amount of progress that States are \nrequired to make as part of establishing their reasonable progress \ngoal. Rather, the purpose of the statute and RHR simply requires States \nto achieve ``reasonable'' progress, not maximal progress, toward \nCongress's natural visibility goal. Additionally, we find that Texas \nwas reasonable in determining that no further emission\n\n[[Page 22176]]\n\nreductions were necessary beyond what was accounted for in the CENRAP \nmodeling, which included the emission reductions which were anticipated \nunder the CAIR program (or its replacement). As discussed in the \nfollowing paragraphs, Texas SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program and the \nCSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> Program serve as replacements for the reductions \nanticipated from the CAIR program.\n    Texas's 2009 Plan sought to satisfy SO<INF>2</INF> and \nNO<INF>X</INF> BART requirements for EGUs, by relying on the finding in \nplace at the time that CAIR was better than BART, and that \nparticipation in CAIR would satisfy these BART requirements for \nparticipating EGUs.\\94\\ Chapter 10.5 of Texas's 2009 Plan discusses the \nemission reductions that CAIR or its replacement will bring about \nduring the first planning period in terms of EGU emissions. Due to the \nuncertainty in the amount of reductions that CAIR would bring about, \nTexas relied on the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) projection. The IPM \nprojection estimated that Texas SO<INF>2</INF> emissions in 2018 would \nbe 350,000 tpy. Texas estimated that CAIR would bring about over \n200,000 tpy of SO<INF>2</INF> reductions over the course of the first \nplanning period.\\95\\ These reductions are reflected in the projected \n2018 visibility improvement in the CENRAP modeling relied upon to \nestablish the RPGs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\94\\ As mentioned earlier, because CAIR was vacated, the EPA \nissued a limited disapproval of Texas's 2009 Plan on June 7, 2012, \ndue to its reliance on the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to \naddress BART requirements for Texas EGUs.\n    \\95\\ Chapter 10.5 of Texas's 2009 Plan discusses the emission \nreductions that CAIR or its replacement will bring about during the \nfirst planning period in terms of EGU emissions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In promulgating the Texas SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program as a BART \nalternative that satisfies the SO<INF>2</INF> BART requirements for \ncertain Texas EGUs, the EPA modeled it after the EPA's CSAPR \nSO<INF>2</INF> Group 2 Trading Program.\\96\\ The CSAPR trading programs \nwere promulgated to replace CAIR. Because it was modeled after the \nCSAPR SO<INF>2</INF> Group 2 Trading Program, the Texas SO<INF>2</INF> \nTrading Program established a stringency level comparable to CSAPR in \nTexas. Specifically, Texas's EGUs under CSAPR were estimated to be \naround 317,100 tons per year whereas the Texas SO<INF>2</INF> Trading \nProgram created an assurance level set at 255,083 tons.\\97\\ In \naddition, in our action promulgating the Texas SO<INF>2</INF> Trading \nProgram, the EPA also relied on CSAPR participation as a NO<INF>X</INF> \nBART alternative for Texas EGUs.\\98\\ Thus, the current FIP in place \nthat satisfies BART requirements for EGUs in Texas is consistent with \nthe approach in the Texas's 2009 Plan that relied on emission \nreductions under CAIR and ensures that the EGU emissions are kept below \na specified assurance level.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\96\\ 85 FR 49170, 49181, 49184 (August 12, 2020).\n    \\97\\ 85 FR 49170, 49184 (August 12, 2020).\n    \\98\\ 82 FR 48328 (October 17, 2017).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Therefore, because Texas considered the four statutory factors in \nestablishing its reasonable progress goals for Big Bend and Guadalupe \nMountains National Park, the EPA is proposing that Texas's 2009 Plan \nhas met the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(i)(A).\n40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(ii)\n    Additionally, under 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(ii), if the State \nestablishes an RPG that provides for a slower rate of improvement in \nvisibility than the rate that would be needed to attain natural \nconditions by 2064, the State must demonstrate, based on the four \nfactors, that the rate of progress to attain natural conditions by 2064 \nis not reasonable, and that the RPG adopted by the State is reasonable. \nThe State must also provide an assessment of the number of years it \nwould take to attain natural conditions if visibility improvement \ncontinues at the rate of progress selected by the State as reasonable.\n    Texas's RPGs for the 20% worst days established a slower rate of \nprogress than the URP for Big Bend and the Guadalupe Mountains. Texas \ncalculated that under the rate of progress it selected as reasonable, \nnatural visibility conditions (as calculated by Texas) would not be \nattained at Big Bend until 2155 and at the Guadalupe Mountains until \n2081.\\99\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\99\\ Texas also included calculations based on the EPA's default \nnatural conditions, estimating attainment of natural visibility \nconditions at the Big Bend in 2215 and Guadalupe Mountains in 2167 \nin appendix 10-3 of its regional haze SIP.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Texas submitted that the RPGs it established for Big Bend and the \nGuadalupe Mountains on the 20% worst days were reasonable, and that it \nwas not reasonable to achieve the glide path in 2018. In support of \nthis conclusion, Texas reiterated the over $300 million cost of \ncompliance figure it calculated and the lack of visibility benefits it \nestimated as part of its four-factor analysis. Texas also took other \nfactors into consideration in determining that it is not reasonable to \nachieve the glide paths in 2018 and that the RPGs adopted by the State \nwere reasonable. Among these other factors, Texas specifically \nindicated that the ability to meet the URP or make additional progress \ntowards reaching natural visibility conditions was impeded primarily by \nthe significant contribution of emissions from Mexico and other \ninternational sources. As support, Texas included a discussion of the \npollutant contributions and the sources of visibility impairment at \nthese Class I areas (see section 10.6. and Chapter 11 of the 2009 \nPlan). This discussion showed that based on Particulate Matter Source \nApportionment Technology (PSAT) analysis conducted by CENRAP, 52 \npercent of the impairment at Big Bend and 25 percent of the impairment \nat Guadalupe Mountains was from Mexico and areas further south.\\100\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\100\\ 2009 Plan, at 10-10.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In our prior disapproval of Texas's RPGs, we expressed concerns \nwith how Texas weighed the four factors, primarily as it related to \nconsideration of costs and visibility benefits. As mentioned \npreviously, the Fifth Circuit determined that the EPA's disapprovals \nwould likely be found to be arbitrary and capricious. The court also \ndetermined that the Petitioners had a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of demonstrating that the EPA's FIP was unreasonable and likely \narbitrary and capricious. Specifically, the court noted that the EPA's \nFIP would require a number of costly control measures to be installed \nthough the visibility conditions at the time were already better than \nTexas's RPGs and the RPGs the EPA established in the FIP. Therefore, \nthe EPA is proposing to approve the portion of Texas's 2009 Plan \naddressing the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(ii).\n    Additionally, we agree with the TCEQ that emissions and transport \nfrom Mexico and other international sources will limit the rate of \nprogress achievable on the 20% worst days and that efforts to meet the \ngoal of natural visibility by 2064 would require further emissions \nreductions not only within Texas, but also large emission reductions \nfrom international sources.\\101\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\101\\ Given the impacts from international emissions and the \nfact that the RHR did not allow States to adjust how the URP was \ncalculated to account for international emissions for the first \nplanning period, it was not reasonable at the time for Texas to \nestablish a reasonable progress goal consistent with the rate of \nvisibility improvement that would be needed to attain natural \nconditions by 2064. Furthermore, the approach followed in the first \nplanning period for determining the URP for the most impaired days \ninvolved selecting the most impaired days as the monitored days with \nthe highest actual deciview levels regardless of the source of the \nparticulate matter causing the visibility impairment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    EPA also notes that there has been an overall reduction in \nemissions from the group of sources that Texas selected for evaluation \nas part of its 2009 Plan. SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from this group in \n2018 were at least 80,000 tons less than what was\n\n[[Page 22177]]\n\nprojected. Overall, emissions in Texas were lower than projected for \n2018 and consequently, monitored visibility data shows visibility \nimprovement exceeding what had been originally projected for 2018.\\102\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\102\\ Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE), \n<a href=\"https://vista.cira.colostate.edu/Improve/rhr-summary-data/\">https://vista.cira.colostate.edu/Improve/rhr-summary-data/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Requirements Related to the Long-Term Strategy\n    Section 51.308(d)(3) provides that Texas's long-term strategy \ninclude enforceable emissions limitations, compliance schedules, and \nother measures necessary to achieve the reasonable progress goals \nestablished by States having mandatory Class I areas. There are a \nnumber of requirements a State must meet when establishing its long-\nterm strategy. These requirements include: (1) States must consult with \ndownwind States to develop coordinated management strategies that \naddress regional haze visibility impairment; \\103\\ (2) where multiple \nStates cause or contribute to visibility impairment in a Class I area, \neach State must demonstrate that it has put all measures necessary to \nobtain its share of emission reductions needed to meet the progress \ngoal for the Class I area; \\104\\ (3) each State must provide and \ndocument the technical basis on which the State is relying to determine \nits share of emission reductions necessary to achieve reasonable \nprogress for each Class I area it affects; \\105\\ and (4) in formulating \ntheir long-term strategies, States also have to consider the emissions \nlimitations and schedule for compliance to achieve the reasonable \nprogress goal.\\106\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\103\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3)(i).\n    \\104\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3)(ii).\n    \\105\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3)(iii) and (iv).\n    \\106\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3)(v)(C).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(d)(3)(i) requires that where Texas has emissions \nthat are reasonably anticipated to contribute to visibility impairment \nin any mandatory Class I area located in another State or States, it \nmust consult with the other State(s) in order to develop coordinated \nemission management strategies. In the 2009 Plan, Texas reviewed the \nCENRAP modeling to assess which Class I areas in other States would be \nimpacted by Texas's emissions.\\107\\ Modeling indicated potential \nimpacts to several out of State Class I areas from Texas sources. As \nevidenced in Chapter 4 and appendix 4 of Texas's 2009 Plan, Texas \nconducted the requisite consultation with these States. Texas included \ndocumentation of its calls and correspondence with the relevant States \nfrom 2007 to 2008, prior to submitting its SIP in 2009. Texas's \nconsultation documentation confirms that no States disagreed with \nTexas's approach to its long-term strategy. During consultation, \nLouisiana determined that emissions from Texas do not contribute to \nvisibility impairment at the Breton Wilderness Class I area. Colorado \nconfirmed during consultation that the projected emissions reductions \nin Texas's 2009 Plan would be adequate to meet Texas's apportioned part \nof reductions necessary for Colorado to meet the RPGs for the Colorado \nClass I areas. Based on the 2018 CENRAP projections, Missouri and \nArkansas established RPGs for their Class I areas that provide for a \nslightly greater rate of improvement in visibility than needed to \nattain the URP and determined that the projected emission reductions \nfrom Texas sources included in the model were adequate for the States \nto meet their respective RPGs. Regarding Oklahoma, Texas and Oklahoma \nengaged in multiple conversations regarding Texas's potential impacts \nto the Wichita Mountains Class I area. Stemming from those discussions, \nOklahoma requested that it be able to comment on best available control \ntechnology (BACT) determinations for PSD sources that significantly \nimpact Wichita Mountains. Texas agreed to notify Oklahoma and the \nrelevant FLM whenever modeling indicated that a proposed source \nsignificantly impacts Wichita Mountains. Throughout the consultation \nprocess, Oklahoma did not request any additional reductions from Texas \nand established a reasonable progress goal for Wichita Mountains that \ndid not anticipate further emission reductions beyond those \ncontemplated in Texas's 2009 Plan. For these reasons, as well as those \nreasons articulated in section V.B, we propose to find that Texas has \nsatisfied the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3)(i).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\107\\ Texas First Planning Period Regional Haze SIP, page 4-2. \nThe relevant States are Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Missouri, \nArkansas, and Oklahoma.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(d)(3)(ii) requires that if Texas emissions cause or \ncontribute to impairment in another State's Class I area, it must \ndemonstrate that it has included in its regional haze SIP all measures \nnecessary to obtain its share of the emission reductions needed to meet \nthe progress goal for that Class I area. Section 51.308(d)(3)(ii) also \nrequires that since Texas participated in a regional planning process, \nit must ensure it has included all measures needed to achieve its \napportionment of emission reduction obligations agreed upon through \nthat process. As discussed in the previous paragraphs, Texas consulted \nwith the States that it identified for which emissions from Texas are \nreasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment \nat a Class I area located in that State. Through these consultation \nprocesses, none of the potentially impacted States requested that Texas \ninclude any additional measures in its 2009 Plan, and each State \nestablished RPGs that did not anticipate any additional emissions \nreductions from Texas sources beyond those reflected in the CENRAP \nmodeling. For these reasons, we are proposing that Texas has met the \nrequirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3)(ii).\n    Section 51.308(d)(3)(iii) requires that Texas document the \ntechnical basis, including modeling, monitoring and emissions \ninformation, on which it is relying to determine its apportionment of \nemission reduction obligations necessary for achieving reasonable \nprogress in each mandatory Class I area it affects. It may meet this \nrequirement by relying on technical analyses developed by the regional \nplanning organization and approved by all State participants. Texas \nrelied on technical analyses developed by CENRAP and approved by all \nState participants, but it also performed additional technical \nanalyses, based on Texas's expertise and knowledge of specific Texas \nrelated information. These additional analyses thus built upon the work \nof the regional planning organization in order to evaluate additional \ncontrols. Additionally, Texas's 2009 Plan included emissions inventory \ninformation as detailed in Chapter 7 and appendix 7-1. Texas's 2009 \nPlan also included a modeling assessment as detailed in Chapters 8 and \nappendix 8-1 of its 2009 Plan. Given the extensive technical, modeling, \nand monitoring information included and relied upon in Texas's 2009 \nPlan, we are proposing that Texas has met the requirements of 40 CFR \n51.308(d)(3)(iii).\n    Section 51.308(d)(3)(v)(C) requires that, in developing its long-\nterm strategy, Texas consider emissions limitations and schedules of \ncompliance to achieve the RPGs. Texas determined that implementation of \nexisting and ongoing control measures was adequate to achieve the RPGs \nestablished by it and other CENRAP States. As such, and for the reasons \narticulated in section V.A of this document to support our proposed \napproval of Texas's RPGs, we are proposing that Texas has met the \nrequirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3)(v)(C), finding that additional \nmeasures for Texas's long-\n\n[[Page 22178]]\n\nterm strategy are unnecessary for this planning period.\n4. Proposed Action\n    The regional haze program is made up of discrete planning periods \nwith the ultimate goal of eventually achieving natural visibility in \nClass I areas. For each planning period, States must submit SIPs to \ndemonstrate that progress is being made towards the goal of natural \nvisibility, including a long-term strategy that contains measures that \nare necessary to make reasonable progress. As previously stated, the \nfirst planning period SIPs were due in 2007, and the planning period \nended in 2018. Given Texas's consideration of the statutory factors and \nthe explanation and justification outlined in the previous sections, we \nare proposing to approve the portions of Texas's 2009 Plan addressing \nthe following requirements:\n\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(1)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii), regarding \nTexas's consideration of the four statutory factors in establishing \nits reasonable progress goals for the Guadalupe Mountains and Big \nBend National Parks;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(1)(i)(B), regarding Texas's \ncalculation of the emission reductions needed to achieve the uniform \nrates of progress for the Guadalupe Mountains and Big Bend National \nParks;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(2)(iii), regarding Texas's \ncalculation of natural visibility conditions for the Guadalupe \nMountains and Big Bend National Parks;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(2)(iv)(A), regarding Texas's \ncalculation of the number of deciviews by which baseline conditions \nexceed natural visibility conditions for the Guadalupe Mountains and \nBig Bend National Parks;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(i), regarding consultation \nrequirements with other States where emissions from Texas are \nreasonably anticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in any \nClass I area located in another State or States;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(ii), regarding Texas securing its \nshare of reductions necessary to achieve the reasonable progress \ngoals at impacted Class I areas in other States;\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(iii), regarding Texas's \ndocumentation of its technical basis for which it is relying on to \ndetermine its apportionment of emission reductions necessary for \nthose Class I areas in other States for which it affects; and\n    <bullet> Section 51.308(d)(3)(v)(C), regarding Texas's emission \nlimitations and schedules for compliance to achieve the reasonable \nprogress goals.\n\nB. Oklahoma's 2010 Plan\n\n    As discussed in section III.B. of this document, the EPA finalized \na disapproval of the portions of Oklahoma's 2010 Plan addressing the \nreasonable progress requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1) in our 2016 \nFinal Rule. Because the SIP disapprovals and FIP portions of the 2016 \nFinal Rule were vacated, the EPA now has an outstanding obligation to \nevaluate and act on this portion of Oklahoma's 2010 Plan.\n1. Establishment of RPGs and Visibility Improvement\n    For each mandatory Class I Federal area located within the State, \nOklahoma must establish goals (expressed in deciviews) that provide for \nreasonable progress towards achieving natural visibility \nconditions.\\108\\ The reasonable progress goals must provide for an \nimprovement in visibility for the most impaired days over the period of \nthe SIP and ensure no degradation in visibility for the least impaired \ndays over the same period.\\109\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\108\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1).\n    \\109\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    CENRAP modeling projected visibility conditions anticipated at the \nWichita Mountains in 2018.\\110\\ This was based on the emissions \nreductions resulting from federal and State control programs that were \neither in effect at the time or with mandated future-year emission \nreduction schedules that predated 2018.\\111\\ Based on the results of \nthe four-factor analysis (discussed in the following paragraphs), the \nresults of the CENRAP modeling, and additional information developed by \nCENRAP or obtained through direct consultations with States anticipated \nto impact visibility at Wichita Mountains, the ODEQ decided to adopt \nthe CENRAP modeled 2018 visibility conditions as the RPGs for the \nWichita Mountains Class I area.\\112\\ The ODEQ established an RPG of \n21.47 dv for the Wichita Mountains for 2018 for the 20% worst \ndays.\\113\\ This represents a 2.33 dv improvement in visibility over a \nbaseline of 23.81 dv.\\114\\ The ODEQ's RPG for the 20 percent worst days \nand 20 percent least impaired days are shown in Tables 5 and 6, which \nare based on information from Tables IX-2 through IX-4 of Oklahoma's \n2010 Plan.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\110\\ 2010 Plan, at 104.\n    \\111\\ 2010 Plan, at 104.\n    \\112\\ 2010 Plan, at 104-107.\n    \\113\\ 2010 Plan, at 104-106.\n    \\114\\ 2010 Plan, at 104-106.\n\n                   Table 5--Oklahoma Class I Area Reasonable Progress Goals on 20% Worst Days\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              Projected 2018      Improvement\n                  Oklahoma Class I area                        Baseline      visibility (RPG)  projected by 2018\n                                                           conditions (dv)         (dv)          using RPG (dv)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWichita Mountains........................................           23.81              21.47               2.33\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTable 6--Oklahoma Class I Area Comparison of Reasonable Progress Goal to\n             Baseline Conditions on 20% Least Impaired Days\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Baseline visibility    Projected 2018\n      Oklahoma Class I area         conditions (dv)     visibility (dv)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWichita Mountains...............                9.78               9.23\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As shown in Tables 5 and 6 of this document, the ODEQ's modeled RPG \nfor the 20% worst days shows an improvement in visibility of 2.33 dv at \nthe Wichita Mountains in 2018 and the modeled RPG for the 20% least \nimpaired days shows an improvement of 0.54 dv from the baseline period.\n    In establishing a reasonable progress goal for any mandatory Class \nI area, the State must consider four statutory factors. These factors \nare the costs of compliance, the time necessary for compliance, the \nenergy and nonair quality environmental impacts of\n\n[[Page 22179]]\n\ncompliance, and the remaining useful life of any potentially affected \nsources. The State must then demonstrate how these factors were taken \ninto consideration in selecting the goal.\n    In its 2010 Plan, the ODEQ determined that sulfate and nitrate were \nthe primary pollutants contributing to visibility impairment within \nOklahoma, and that a large portion of these pollutants would come from \npoint sources.\\115\\ As such, Oklahoma evaluated potential control \nmeasures for point sources of SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF>. To \nevaluate any additional control measures necessary for reasonable \nprogress, the ODEQ initially relied on the same CENRAP analysis that \nTexas in part relied on. In considering the CENRAP analysis, Oklahoma \nfound that it included certain controls that were already installed, \nprohibitively costly, technically infeasible, or otherwise \nunreasonable. As a result, the ODEQ conducted its own analysis that \nrefined the CENRAP analysis for certain sources within Oklahoma. The \nfull list of sources considered can be found in Table IX-5 of \nOklahoma's 2010 Plan.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\115\\ 2010 Plan, 94-97; 107-114; appendix 4-2 of 2010 Plan.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In considering the cost of compliance, the ODEQ relied on the \ncontrol analysis performed by CENRAP as well as its knowledge of \nparticular facilities and experience with implementing ozone reduction \nstrategies.\\116\\ In considering the time necessary for compliance, the \nODEQ determined that any such controls would have to be installed and \nin operation by 2018.\\117\\ It did not identify any detrimental nonair \nquality environmental impacts associated with any controls considered, \nand any energy impacts were factored into the cost of controls.\\118\\ In \nconsidering the remaining useful life of any potentially affected \nsources, the ODEQ stated that none of the sources considered for \nadditional emission reductions had indicated plans to shut down.\\119\\ \nBased on the above analysis of the four factors, the ODEQ concluded \nthat retrofitting the identified point sources of NO<INF>X</INF> and \nSO<INF>2</INF> would impose unreasonable costs for negligible \nvisibility improvement.\\120\\ The ODEQ reasoned that most of the largest \nsources of SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> were already being \ncontrolled through BART, consent decrees or other regulatory \nmechanisms; already had adequate controls in place; or are located too \nfar from the Wichita Mountains, and therefore, have too little \nvisibility impact to justify the cost of additional controls.\\121\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\116\\ 2010 Plan, 109-113; appendix 4-2 of 2010 Plan.\n    \\117\\ 2010 Plan, 109-113.\n    \\118\\ 2010 Plan, 109-113.\n    \\119\\ 2010 Plan, 109-113.\n    \\120\\ 2010 Plan, 109-113.\n    \\121\\ 2010 Plan, 109-113.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The RPGs established by Oklahoma provided for an improvement in \nvisibility conditions for the most impaired days over the first \nplanning period and ensured no degradation in visibility for the least \nimpaired days over the same period. Thus, the ODEQ's RPGs for Wichita \nMountains are consistent with the requirement in the RHR that they \nprovide for an improvement in visibility for the most impaired days \nover the period of the SIP and ensure no degradation in visibility for \nthe least impaired days over the same period. Additionally, Oklahoma's \n2010 Plan included a demonstration showing how these factors were taken \ninto consideration in selecting the goal. As outlined in the Fifth \nCircuit's 2016 stay opinion, the court stated that the EPA's prior \ndisapproval of Oklahoma's 2010 Plan stemmed in large part from concerns \nthat the EPA had with Texas's analysis in establishing its RPGs--\nconcerns that the Court said were likely arbitrary and capricious. \nBecause we are now proposing to approve Texas's 2009 Plan, we therefore \npropose to approve the RPGs established by Oklahoma. Specifically, we \nfind that Oklahoma's decision to focus the analysis of the four \nstatutory factors on emissions of NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> \nfrom point sources to be reasonable, as the CENRAP modeling results and \nthe ODEQ's analysis in sections V.F and VIII of the Oklahoma's 2010 \nPlan indicate that sulfate and nitrate are the predominant pollutants \nthat affects the visibility on the worst 20% days at the Wichita \nMountains, and comes primarily from point sources. Oklahoma considered \nthe four statutory factors as required by 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(i)(A) in \nevaluating the major point sources of both SO<INF>2</INF> and \nNO<INF>X</INF>. The ODEQ analyzed the cost of compliance by reviewing \nthe cost information previously developed by CENRAP and made changes to \nthe cost information based on its knowledge of the facilities. Oklahoma \nfocused on moderate cost controls for sources likely to contribute to \nvisibility impairment at the Wichita Mountains. In considering the time \nnecessary for compliance, the ODEQ determined that any such controls \nwould have to be installed and in operation by 2018. It did not \nidentify any detrimental nonair quality environmental impacts \nassociated with any controls considered, and any energy impacts were \nfactored into the cost of controls. In considering the remaining useful \nlife of any potentially affected sources, the ODEQ stated that none of \nthe sources considered for additional emission reductions had indicated \nplans to shut down. Furthermore, the ODEQ also considered the CENRAP \nmodeling results, which indicated that Oklahoma point sources \ncontribute only approximately 3.0 Mm<SUP>-1</SUP> of the total 86.56 \nMm<SUP>-1</SUP> of light extinction projected at Wichita Mountains in \n2018.\\122\\ Based on the 2016 Stay Opinion, the fact that Oklahoma \nconsidered the four factors, the relative lack of visibility impact \nfrom in-State point sources, and the fact that emissions from point \nsources were also being reduced through satisfying BART requirements, \nwe agree with the ODEQ's conclusion that additional control measures \nare unnecessary, and therefore, propose that the requirements of 40 CFR \n51.308(d)(1)(i)(A) have been met.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\122\\ 2010 Plan, 96-100.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Uniform Rate of Progress and Analysis of RPGs\n    In establishing a reasonable progress goal for any mandatory Class \nI Federal area within the State, Oklahoma must analyze and determine \nthe rate of progress needed to attain natural visibility conditions by \nthe year 2064.\\123\\ To calculate this rate of progress (URP), Oklahoma \nmust compare baseline visibility conditions to natural visibility \nconditions in the mandatory Federal Class I area and determine the \nuniform rate of visibility improvement (measured in deciviews) that \nwould need to be maintained during each implementation period in order \nto attain natural visibility conditions by 2064. In our previous final \nrulemaking in 2011, we found that the ODEQ appropriately calculated the \nURP for Wichita Mountains.\\124\\ Therefore, the only portion of 40 CFR \n51.308(d)(1)(i)(B) that we address is Oklahoma's requirement to \nconsider the emission reduction measures needed to achieve the URP when \nestablishing the RPG for Wichita Mountains. Section 51.308(d)(1)(ii) \nprovides that for the period of the SIP, if Oklahoma establishes a RPG \nthat provides for a slower rate of improvement in visibility than the \nrate that would be needed to attain natural conditions by 2064, it must \ndemonstrate based on the factors in section 51.308(d)(1)(i)(A) that the \nrate of progress for the SIP to attain natural conditions by 2064 is \nnot reasonable; and that the progress goal it adopted is reasonable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\123\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(i)(B).\n    \\124\\ 76 FR 81728 (December 28, 2011).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22180]]\n\n    To calculate the URP, the ODEQ compared baseline visibility \nconditions to natural visibility conditions at the Wichita Mountains \nClass I area and determined the linear rate of visibility improvement \n(in deciviews) that would have to be maintained during each \nimplementation period in order to attain natural visibility conditions \nby 2064. Using a baseline of 23.81 dv and a natural visibility value of \n7.53 dv for the 20 percent worst days, the ODEQ calculated the URP to \nbe 16.28 dv, as depicted by Table 7 of this document, which is adapted \nfrom Table III-9 of the SIP:\n\n     Table 7--Wichita Mountains Visibility Improvement Calculations\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseline Conditions..........................  23.81 dv.\nNatural Visibility...........................  7.53 dv.\nTotal Improvement by 2064....................  16.28 dv.\nImprovement by 2018 at Uniform Rate of         3.80 dv.\n Progress.\nUniform Rate of Progress.....................  0.27 dv/year.\n2018 RPG.....................................  21.47 dv.\nImprovement by 2018 under Oklahoma's RPG.....  2.33 dv.\nURP in 2018..................................  20.01 dv.\nImprovement Projected by 2018 Using 2018 RPG.  2.33 dv.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    After considering the URP, the results of the CENRAP modeling and \nthe four reasonable progress factors, the ODEQ determined that meeting \nthe URP goal for 2018 was not reasonable.\\125\\ In its 2010 Plan, the \nODEQ explained that the CENRAP control case sensitivity evaluation \nprojected that visibility at Wichita Mountains would be improved by an \nadditional 0.75 dv on the worst 20% days over what the ODEQ projected \nas its RPG of 21.47 dv for 2018, if controls were implemented at the \nsources that met CENRAP's combination of baseline emissions, potential \nfor cost-effective add-on controls, and location (21.47-20.72 = \n0.75).\\126\\ This projected improvement would not be sufficient to meet \nthe URP. Furthermore, the ODEQ noted that most of the improvement \nprojected by the CENRAP analysis would come from controls on sources \noutside of Oklahoma. As such, Oklahoma adopted the 2018 projected \nvisibility conditions from the CENRAP photochemical modeling as the \nRPGs for the 20% best days and 20% worst days for the Wichita \nMountains. The ODEQ calculated that under the selected rate of \nprogress, Wichita Mountains would attain natural visibility conditions \nin 2102.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\125\\ 2010 Plan, 107-114.\n    \\126\\ 2010 Plan, 109. ODEQ mistakenly referred to an estimated \nvisibility of 20.97 dv for the control scenario instead of the \ncorrect value of 20.72 dv. See correspondence from ODEQ (Lee Warden) \nto EPA (Michael Feldman) on 7/14/2014.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    We propose to approve the ODEQ's demonstration that it is not \nreasonable to meet the URP for Wichita Mountains for this planning \nperiod based on its reliance on the CENRAP analysis and modeling \nprojections. As explained earlier in our discussion of 40 CFR \n51.308(d)(1)(i)(A), Oklahoma considered the four statutory factors and \nestablished RPGs that provided for visibility improvement at Wichita \nMountains over the course of the first planning period. Neither the CAA \nnor the RHR rule specify the specific amount of progress that States \nare required to make as part of establishing their reasonable progress \ngoal. In our prior disapproval of Oklahoma's 2010 Plan, while we agreed \nthat further emissions reductions from Oklahoma sources beyond BART \nwere not necessary to make reasonable progress, we expressed the \nconcern that the consultation process with Texas failed to provide \nOklahoma with the information necessary to determine the reasonable \nreductions from its sources given the anticipated impacts from Texas \nsources at Wichita Mountains. This resulted in Oklahoma being unable to \nconsider all the emission reductions needed to meet or approach the \nURP. As mentioned previously, the Fifth Circuit determined that the \nEPA's disapproval as to this point would likely be found to be \narbitrary and capricious. Specifically, the 2016 Stay Opinion \nhighlighted that neither RHR nor the Clean Air Act explicitly require \nupwind States to provide downwind States with specific types of \ninformation. Given the volume of analysis produced by CENRAP, and the \nfact that the EPA has never before disapproved the consultation between \nStates under the Regional Haze Rule, the court determined that the \nPetitioners had a likelihood of success on the merits of demonstrating \nthat EPA's disapproval of the RPGs that Oklahoma established was \narbitrary and capricious. As previously discussed, Oklahoma considered \nthe four statutory factors in establishing its RPGs for Wichita \nMountains, which provided for improvements in visibility over the \ncourse of the first planning period based on emission reductions due to \nBART requirements from Oklahoma sources as well as emission reductions \nfrom Texas sources that were included in the CENRAP modeling as \ndiscussed in section V.A of this document. Oklahoma showed that further \nemission reductions from Oklahoma sources was not projected to achieve \nthe URP, and after extensive consultation with Texas, Oklahoma \ndetermined that additional emission reductions from Texas sources were \nnot necessary to meet the RPG it established. For these reasons, we are \nproposing that the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(i)(B) and \n51.308(d)(1)(ii) have been met.\n    Additionally, the EPA notes that there has been an overall \nreduction in emissions from the group of sources that Texas selected \nfor evaluation as part of its 2009 Plan. Overall, Texas emissions were \nlower than projected for 2018 and consequently, monitored visibility \ndata shows visibility improvement exceeding what had been originally \nprojected for 2018.\n3. Reasonable Progress Consultation\n    In developing the reasonable progress goal for Wichita Mountains, \nOklahoma must consult with those States which may reasonably be \nanticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment in the \nClass I area.\\127\\ In any situation in which Oklahoma cannot agree with \nanother such State or group of States that a goal provides for \nreasonable progress, Oklahoma must describe in its submittal the \nactions taken to resolve the disagreement.\\128\\ In reviewing Oklahoma's \nSIP submittal, the Administrator will take this information into \naccount in determining whether its goal for visibility improvement \nprovides for reasonable progress towards natural visibility \nconditions.\\129\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\127\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(iv).\n    \\128\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(iv).\n    \\129\\ 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(iv).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22181]]\n\n    In its 2010 Plan, the ODEQ identified several States that were \nprojected through visibility modeling to contribute more than 1 Mm-1 of \nlight extinction at the Wichita Mountains in 2018 and invited these \nStates to consult. It conducted four consultations.\\130\\ It directed \nits first consultation to the tribal leaders in Oklahoma and their \nenvironmental managers, on August 14, 2007.\\131\\ The ODEQ held the next \nthree consultations as conference calls with representatives from \nCENRAP, the EPA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arkansas, Iowa, \nKansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and Texas.\\132\\ The \nODEQ received written responses from the Arkansas Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, the TCEQ, and the Missouri Department of Natural \nResources.\\133\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\130\\ 2010 Plan, 115, appendix 10-1.\n    \\131\\ 2010 Plan, 115, appendix 10-1.\n    \\132\\ 2010 Plan, 115, appendix 10-1.\n    \\133\\ Copies of these letters can be found in appendix 10-1 of \nthe 2010 Plan.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In terms of the consultation process between Texas and Oklahoma \nspecifically, the States exchanged a series of letters in 2007 and \n2008.\\134\\ On August 3, 2007, the ODEQ sent a letter to the TCEQ in \nwhich it noted that despite significant planned reductions in \nSO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from sources in Oklahoma \nand Texas, the Wichita Mountains was not projected to meet the URP. The \nODEQ requested that the TCEQ require new and modified PSD sources to \nconduct analyses of their impacts on visibility at the Wichita \nMountains and that the ODEQ be given an opportunity to review and \ncomment on BACT determinations for proposed projects likely to have a \ncertain impact on visibility at the Wichita Mountains. On October 15, \n2007, the TCEQ sent a response to the ODEQ, agreeing that modeling \nshowed emissions from Texas to be a significant source of visibility \nimpairment at the Wichita Mountains. The TCEQ also noted, however, that \nsignificant reductions from Texas will be realized in the next several \nyears. In response to the ODEQ's specific request for the opportunity \nto comment on BACT for new and modified major sources, the TCEQ stated \nthat it welcomed comment during the public review and comment period \nand would notify FLMs and the ODEQ if modeling were to indicate that a \nproposed source might significantly impact the Wichita Mountains.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\134\\ Appendix 10-1 of the 2010 Plan.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Several months after this initial exchange of letters, the two \nStates again exchanged letters. On March 25, 2008, following comments \nmade by us and the federal land managers on Texas's draft Regional Haze \nSIP, the TCEQ sent a letter to the ODEQ regarding emissions that affect \nthe Wichita Mountains. The TCEQ provided a copy of the PSAT modeling \nresults developed by CENRAP indicating the contribution for each source \narea to visibility impairment at the Wichita Mountains. The TCEQ stated \nin the letter that PSAT modeling indicated that the probable impacts of \nTexas sources at the Wichita Mountains will be reduced by 2018 due to \nexpected emission reductions from current and planned controls. The \nTCEQ then requested concurrence from Oklahoma on this assessment and a \nverification that Oklahoma was not depending on any additional \nreductions from Texas sources in order to meet the RPG for the Wichita \nMountains. On May 12, 2008, the ODEQ sent a response to the TCEQ in \nwhich it noted that it concurred with the information the TCEQ had \nprovided. The ODEQ stated that it had developed its RPG for the worst \n20% days for the Wichita Mountains through the CENRAP deliberations and \nthat its RPG did not anticipate emission reductions beyond those that \nTexas already planned to implement and upon which CENRAP modeling \nstudies have relied.\n    We agree with the ODEQ's approach for identifying those States with \nsources that may impact visibility at the Wichita Mountains and its \ndecision to invite those States to consult. Through the consultation \nprocess, the ODEQ was able to gain additional information regarding the \npotential impacts from nearby States. We also find that Oklahoma \nreasonably determined that additional reductions from Arkansas, \nLouisiana, Missouri, and Iowa were not necessary for reasonable \nprogress based on the projected impacts from those States as \ndemonstrated by the CENRAP modeling results.\\135\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\135\\ 2010 Plan, Table VIII-10.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In terms of its consultation with Texas, as discussed earlier in \nthis document, the 2016 Stay Opinion explained that the Petitioners had \na likelihood of success on the merits in determining that our \ndisapproval of the 2010 Plan based on the consultation with Texas was \narbitrary and capricious. We note that the States engaged in extensive \ndiscussions regarding impacts from Texas sources at Wichita \nMountains.\\136\\ The RHR does not specify what is required of States \nduring the consultation process or dictate a specific outcome in terms \nof agreeing upon a reasonable progress goal. Rather, it explains the \nsteps States must take in the event that States disagree over whether a \ngoal established for a particular Class I area does not provide for \nreasonable progress. In such situations, a State must describe in its \nsubmittal the actions taken to resolve the disagreement. As described \nabove, the ODEQ ultimately established an RPG that did not anticipate \nadditional reductions from Texas sources. As such, there was not a \ndisagreement between the States. While both states agreed that there \nwould be impacts from Texas sources at Wichita Mountains, they also \nagreed that there would be emission reductions from both Texas and \nOklahoma sources and improvement in visibility at Wichita \nMountains.\\137\\ Because Texas and Oklahoma engaged in consultation and \nagreed on the RPG established by Oklahoma for Wichita Mountains, we \nfind that Oklahoma's consultation process with Texas was adequate. For \nthese reasons, we propose that the requirements of 40 CFR \n51.308(d)(1)(iv) have been met.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\136\\ Appendix 10-1 of the 2010 Plan.\n    \\137\\ Appendix 10-1 of the 2010 Plan.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Impact on Areas of Indian Country\n    Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma, \n140 S. Ct. 2452 (2020), the Governor of the State of Oklahoma requested \napproval under section 10211(a) of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, \nEfficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005: A Legacy for Users, Public \nLaw 109-59, 119 Stat. 1144, 1937 (August 10, 2005) (``SAFETEA''), to \nadminister in certain areas of Indian country (as defined at 18 U.S.C. \n1151) the State's environmental regulatory programs that were \npreviously approved by the EPA outside of Indian country. The State's \nrequest excluded certain areas of Indian country further described \nbelow. In addition, the State only sought approval to the extent that \nsuch approval was necessary for the State to administer a program in \nlight of Oklahoma Dept. of Environmental Quality v. EPA, 740 F.3d 185 \n(D.C. Cir. 2014).\\138\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\138\\ In ODEQ v. EPA, the D.C. Circuit held that under the CAA, \nStates have the authority to implement a SIP in non-reservation \nareas of Indian country in the State, unless there has been a \ndemonstration of tribal jurisdiction. Under the D.C. Circuit's \ndecision, the CAA does not provide authority to States to implement \nSIPs in Indian reservations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The EPA has approved Oklahoma's SAFETEA request to administer all \nof the State's EPA-approved environmental regulatory programs in the \nrequested areas of Indian country. As requested by Oklahoma, the EPA's \napproval under SAFETEA does not include Indian country lands, including \nrights-of-way running through the same, that: (1) qualify as Indian \nallotments, the Indian\n\n[[Page 22182]]\n\ntitles to which have not been extinguished, under 18 U.S.C. 1151(c); \n(2) are held in trust by the United States on behalf of an individual \nIndian or Tribe; or (3) are owned in fee by a Tribe, if the Tribe (a) \nacquired that fee title to such land, or an area that included such \nland, in accordance with a treaty with the United States to which such \nTribe was a party, and (b) never allotted the land to a member or \ncitizen of the Tribe (collectively ``excluded Indian country lands'').\n    The EPA's approval under SAFETEA expressly provided that to the \nextent the EPA's prior approvals of Oklahoma's environmental programs \nexcluded Indian country, any such exclusions are superseded for the \ngeographic areas of Indian country covered by the EPA's approval of \nOklahoma's SAFETEA request.\\139\\ The approval also provided that future \nrevisions or amendments to Oklahoma's approved environmental regulatory \nprograms would extend to the covered areas of Indian country (without \nany further need for additional requests under SAFETEA).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\139\\ The EPA's prior approvals relating to Oklahoma's SIP \nfrequently noted that the SIP was not approved to apply in areas of \nIndian country (except as explained in the D.C. Circuit's decision \nin ODEQ v. EPA) located in the State. Such prior expressed \nlimitations are superseded by the EPA's approval of Oklahoma's \nSAFETEA request.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As explained above, the EPA is proposing to approve portions of the \nOklahoma 2010 Plan that relate to reasonable progress requirements for \nthe first planning period from 2007 through 2018, which will apply \nstatewide. Consistent with the D.C. Circuit's decision in ODEQ v. EPA \nand with the EPA's SAFETEA approval, these SIP revisions will apply to \nareas of Indian country as follows: (1) pursuant to the SAFETEA \napproval, the SIP revisions will apply to all Indian country In the \nState of Oklahoma other than the excluded Indian country lands as \ndescribed above; and (2) pursuant to the D.C. Circuit's decision in \nODEQ v. EPA, the SIP revisions will also apply to any Indian allotments \nor dependent Indian communities that are located outside of any Indian \nreservation and over which there has been no demonstration of tribal \nauthority.\n5. Proposed Action\n    For the reasons described in sections V.A and V.B, we are proposing \nto approve the portion of the Oklahoma regional haze SIP that addressed \nthe requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(i) through (v).\n\nC. Texas's 2014 Progress Report SIP Revision (2014 Plan)\n\n    Each State is required to submit a progress report that evaluates \nprogress towards the RPGs for each Class I area within the State and \nfor each Class I area outside the State which may be affected by \nemissions from within the State. 40 CFR 51.308(g). In addition, the \nprovisions of 40 CFR 51.308(h) require States to submit, at the same \ntime as the progress report, a determination of the adequacy of the \nState's existing regional haze implementation plan.\\140\\ The progress \nreport for the first planning period is due five years after submittal \nof the initial regional haze SIP and must take the form of a SIP \nrevision. Texas submitted its first periodic progress report SIP on \nMarch 24, 2014 (2014 Plan). The 2014 Plan assessed visibility progress \ntoward the 2018 RPGs for two Class I areas in Texas: Big Bend and \nGuadalupe Mountains National Parks. The 2014 Plan also assessed \nvisibility progress for 12 other Class I areas in six other States that \nmay be affected by emissions from within Texas through collaboration \nwith the Central Regional Air Planning Association (CENRAP):\\141\\ Caney \nCreek and Upper Buffalo Wilderness Areas in Arkansas; Great Sand Dunes \nWilderness Area in Colorado; Breton Wilderness Area in Louisiana; \nCarlsbad Caverns National Park, Bosque del Apache, Salt Creek, Wheeler \nPeak, and White Mountain Wilderness Areas in New Mexico; Hercules \nGlades and Mingo Wilderness Areas in Missouri; and Wichita Mountains \nWilderness Area in Oklahoma.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\140\\ The Regional Haze Rule requires States to provide in the \nprogress report an assessment of whether the current \n``implementation plan'' is sufficient to enable the States to meet \nall established RPGs under 40 CFR 51.308(g). The term \n``implementation plan'' is defined for purposes of the Regional Haze \nRule to mean any SIP, FIP, or Tribal Implementation Plan. As such, \nthe Agency may consider measures in any issued FIP as well as those \nin a State's regional haze plan in assessing the adequacy of the \n``existing implementation plan'' under 40 CFR 51.308(g) and (h).\n    \\141\\ The CENRAP is a collaborative effort of tribal \ngovernments, State governments and various federal agencies \nrepresenting the central States (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, \nArkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota; and tribal \ngovernments included in these States) that provided technical and \npolicy tools for the central States and tribes to comply with the \nEPA's Regional Haze regulations. Due to lack of funding, CENRAP \nsubsequently ceased to function, and States now communicate through \nthe Central States Air Resource Agencies (CenSARA) with the other \nStates that were part of CENRAP.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Control Measures\n    Section 51.308(g)(1) requires a description of the status of \nimplementation of control measures included in the first planning \nperiod regional haze SIP for achieving reasonable progress goals for \nClass I areas both within and outside the State. Section 51.308(g)(2) \nrequires a summary of the emissions reductions achieved from \nimplementing the control measures in the first planning period regional \nhaze SIP. Chapter 2 of Texas's 2014 Plan provides a summary of control \nmeasures and emissions reductions that were achieved from implementing \nthose control measures included in their first planning period SIP.\n    As discussed previously in this document, Texas relied on \nparticipation in CAIR to satisfy the NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> \nBART requirements for BART-eligible EGUs.\\142\\ In the 2014 Plan and its \nassociated appendix E,\\143\\ Texas provides information on emission \nallowances under CAIR compared to annual EGU emissions. The 2014 Plan \nalso outlined the status of other measures mentioned in its 2009 Plan \nincluding the status of EGU controls for Texas ozone nonattainment \nareas, and the Mass Emissions Cap-and-Trade (MECT) Program in the \nHouston-Galveston-Brazoria ozone nonattainment area. The EPA proposes \nthat the requirements regarding reporting the status of implementation \nof measures and estimation of emissions reductions from implementation \nof those measures for the first implementation period have been met.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\142\\ CAIR was subsequently remanded and replaced by CSAPR, \nwhich led to EPA issuing a limited disapproval of Texas's 2009 \nRegional Haze SIP due to its reliance on CAIR. However, at the time \nthat Texas submitted the progress report in 2014, all sources that \nwere covered by CAIR continued to comply with the requirements of \nthe program as CSAPR was vacated and subject to pending legal \nchallenges.\n    \\143\\ See Table 2-6 in Texas's 2014 Plan (page 2-7).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Visibility Conditions and Changes\n    Section 51.308(g)(3) requires, for each Class I area within a \nState, an assessment of the following visibility conditions and \nchanges, with values for most impaired and least impaired days \nexpressed in terms of five-year averages of these annual values: \ncurrent visibility conditions for the most and least impaired days; \ndifference between current visibility conditions for the most impaired \nand least impaired days and baseline visibility conditions; and, change \nin visibility impairment for the most impaired and least impaired days \nover the past five years. Texas provided this information in Chapter 3 \nof its 2014 Plan. Texas reported the annual average visibility from the \n2011 IMPROVE report for the 20 percent best (least\n\n[[Page 22183]]\n\nimpaired) and 20 percent worst (most impaired) days at Big Bend and \nGuadalupe Mountains National Parks.\\144\\ The State calculated the \nchange in visibility between five-year average baseline visibility \nconditions from 2000-2004 and the five-year average visibility \nconditions for 2007-2011 (the most recent period at the time of the \nprogress report). The results were tabulated for the 20 percent best \nand worst days and then compared to the 2018 RPGs to determine the \namount of visibility improvement achieved.\\145\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\144\\ The most and least impaired days in the RHR for the first \nplanning period refers to the average visibility impairment \n(measured in dv) for the 20 percent of monitored days in a calendar \nyear with the highest and lowest amount of visibility impairment, \nrespectively, averaged over a five-year period (see 40 CFR 51.301). \nIn this notice, when we refer to ``best days'' we mean ``least \nimpaired'' and when we refer to ``worst days'' we mean ``most \nimpaired.''\n    \\145\\ See Figures 5-1 and 5-2 of the 2014 Plan (pages 5-2 and 5-\n3).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The TCEQ reported that Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains showed \nimproved visibility from the 2000-2004 baseline to the most recent \nperiod available (2007-2011) at the time of the 2014 Plan's submittal \nduring the 20 percent worst days.\\146\\ Both Class I areas also showed \nimprovement from the baseline period on the 20 percent best days and \nsatisfied the goal of no visibility degradation for the first \nimplementation period. The progress report showed that the visibility \nat Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains during the 2007-2011 period were \n0.6 and 1.9 dv, respectively, below the 2000-2004 baseline for the 20 \npercent worst days and 0.2 and 1.0 dv, respectively, below the baseline \nfor the 20 percent best days as reflected in Tables 8 and 9.\\147\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\146\\ Progress reports for the first implementation period used \nspecific terms to describe time-periods. ``Baseline visibility \nconditions'' refers to conditions during the 2000 to 2004 time-\nperiod. ``Current visibility conditions'' refers to the most recent \nfive-year average data available at the time the State submitted its \nprogress report for public review. ``Past five years'' refers to the \nfive-year average previous to the five years used for ``current \nvisibility conditions.''\n    \\147\\ See Figures 3-1 and 3-2 of the 2014 Plan (pages 3-3 to 3-\n4).\n\n                    Table 8--Visibility at Texas Class I Areas for the 20 Percent Worst Days\n                                                [Five-year avg.]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     Baseline                       Most recent\n                          Class I area                              (2000-2004)     (2007-2011)   minus baseline\n                                                                       (dv)            (dv)             (dv)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBig Bend National Park..........................................            17.3            16.7            -0.6\nGuadalupe Mountains National Park...............................            17.2            15.3            -1.9\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* A negative sign indicates a reduction from the baseline.\n\n\n                     Table 9--Visibility at Texas Class I Areas for the 20 Percent Best Days\n                                                [Five-year avg.]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     Baseline       Most recent     Most recent\n                          Class I area                              (2000-2004)     (2007-2011)   minus baseline\n                                                                       (dv)            (dv)             (dv)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBig Bend National Park..........................................             5.8             5.6            -0.2\nGuadalupe Mountains National Park...............................             5.9             4.9            -1.0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* A negative sign indicates a reduction from the baseline\n\n    When comparing the 2018 RPGs with the observed 2007-2011 five-year \nvisibility trends for the 20 percent worst days in the progress report, \nboth national parks are achieving the visibility improvement needed to \nmeet the 2018 RPGs established in the Texas 2009 Plan. Big Bend's \nvisibility improved to almost match its 2018 RPG of 16.6 dv and \nGuadalupe Mountains already realized more visibility improvement than \nneeded to meet its 2018 RPG of 16.3 dv. The EPA thus proposes to \nconclude that the State has adequately addressed the applicable \nprovisions under 40 CFR 51.308(g)(3) with respect to the visibility \nconditions at Texas Class I areas.\n3. Emissions Tracking\n    Section 51.308(g)(4) requires an analysis tracking the change for \nthe previous five years in emissions of pollutants, identified by type \nof source or activity, contributing to visibility impairment from all \nsources and activities within the State. In Chapter 4 of its 2014 Plan, \nTexas provides statewide emissions summaries for several source \ncategories for inventory years 2005 (updated), 2008, and 2011.\\148\\ \nTexas evaluated statewide trends in total emissions for NO<INF>X</INF>, \nSO<INF>2</INF>, and PM<INF>2.5</INF> as compared to the modeled \nprojections for 2018. Figure 4-1 of the 2014 Plan shows a graphic \ncomparison of these inventory years against the modeled projections. \nFor all pollutants, actual emissions remained below the model \nprojections (determined by a straight line between 2002 and 2018). The \nEPA proposes to conclude that the State has adequately addressed the \napplicable provisions under 40 CFR 51.308(g)(4) regarding emissions \ntracking because the State compared the most recent updated emission \ninventory data for key visibility impairing pollutants across Texas \navailable at the time of progress report development with the baseline \nemissions used in the modeling for the regional haze plan.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\148\\ 2014 Progress Report SIP Tables 4-1 through 4-3.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Assessment of Anthropogenic Changes Impeding Visibility Progress\n    Section 51.308(g)(5) requires an assessment of any significant \nchanges in anthropogenic emissions that have occurred over the past \nfive years that have limited or impeded progress in reducing pollutant \nemissions and improving visibility. The State indicated in its 2014 \nPlan \\149\\ that there were no significant changes in anthropogenic \nemissions within or outside the state that limited or impeded progress \nin reducing pollutant emissions and improving visibility at Big Bend or \nGuadalupe Mountains National Parks. Both national parks showed overall \ndownward trends in visibility impairment on the worst days. The\n\n[[Page 22184]]\n\nState's analysis of categorized emission inventories from 2005 to 2011 \npresented in the progress report show that no significant increases in \nemissions within the state are occurring to impede visibility \nimprovement or adversely affect the two Class I areas in Texas. In the \n2014 Plan, Texas identifies that visibility at both Texas Class I areas \nis impacted by emissions from Mexico and that no recent information is \navailable to assess changes in international emissions. Texas also \nrequested that the EPA initiate efforts to secure international \nemission reductions to further improve visibility at the Texas Class I \nareas. The State also reported that no significant anthropogenic \nemission changes occurred in other States over the past five years to \nlimit or impede visibility in Texas. As evidence to support this, the \nTCEQ reported that the IMPROVE sites at Class I areas in the States of \nNew Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, east to the Atlantic Ocean (except \nfor sites near the Canadian border) show reductions in visibility \nimpairment on the 20 percent most impaired days. The TCEQ reported \nthese downward trends in visibility impairment as proof that sources \nwhich contribute to visibility impairment in Texas were absent of major \nchanges in emissions that would otherwise limit or impede visibility in \nTexas Class I areas. The EPA agrees with Texas's conclusion that there \nhave been no significant changes in emissions of visibility impairing \npollutants which have limited or impeded progress in reducing emissions \nand improving visibility in Class I areas during the first planning \nperiod pursuant to 40 CFR 51.308(g)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\149\\ See Page 5-9 of the 2014 Plan.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5. Assessment of Current Strategy To Meet RPGs\n    Section 51.308(g)(6) requires an assessment of whether the \nimplementation plan elements and strategies are sufficient to enable \nTexas, or other states with Class I areas affected by emissions from \nTexas, to meet all their established RPGs for the first planning \nperiod. The EPA views this requirement as a qualitative assessment, in \nlight of emissions and visibility trends and other readily available \ninformation, as to whether Class I areas affected by the state were on \ntrack to meet their 2018 RPGs. In its 2014 Plan, the TCEQ determined \nthat the strategies outlined in the 2009 Plan were sufficient to enable \nTexas and other states with Class I areas affected by emissions from \nTexas to meet all established RPGs. The evaluation set forth in the \n2014 Plan for the Class I areas in Texas was based on the controls and \nRPGs established in the 2009 Plan. The TCEQ assessed the strategies in \nthe 2009 Plan based upon projected emissions and modeling results. The \n2014 Plan showed that the 2005-2011 emission trends for SO<INF>2</INF>, \nNO<INF>X</INF>, and PM, which are the main contributing pollutants to \nregional haze in Texas, decreased by 261,003 tpy SO<INF>2</INF>, \n212,107 tpy NO<INF>X</INF>, and 29,335 tpy PM<INF>2.5</INF>, and \n215,716 tpy PM<INF>10</INF>. Based on available monitored data at the \ntime, comparing the Texas 2018 RPGs with the observed five-year 2007-\n2011 visibility trends for the 20 percent worst days indicated that \nboth Texas Class I areas had, or nearly had, achieved the visibility \nimprovement needed to meet the 2018 RPGs established in the 2009 \nSIP.\\150\\ In the 2014 Plan, the TCEQ identified that sources in Texas \nalso impact 12 other Class I areas in six other states.\\151\\ The TCEQ \ncompared the 2018 RPGs to the monitored visibility at these areas on \nthe 20 percent worst days for the five-year average trends from the \n2000-2004 baseline, 2002-2006, and 2007-2011 periods.\\152\\ The EPA \nproposes to find that the State adequately addressed the applicable \nprovisions under 40 CFR 51.308(g)(6) regarding the strategy assessment. \nIn its 2014 Plan, Texas describes the improving visibility trends and \nprovides an overview of emission reductions to support the \ndetermination that the regional haze plan is sufficient to meet the \n2018 RPGs for Class I areas in the State and Class I areas in other \nStates impacted by Texas emissions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\150\\ 2014 Progress Report, Chapter 5.\n    \\151\\ Data was marked as unavailable for Breton Wilderness in \nLouisiana by TCEQ.\n    \\152\\ 2014 Progress Report (pages 5-5 to 5-8).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6. Review of Visibility Monitoring Strategy\n    Section 51.308(g)(7) requires that States conduct a review of the \ncurrent visibility monitoring strategy and make any modifications to \nthe strategy as necessary. The monitoring strategy for regional haze in \nTexas relies upon participation in the IMPROVE \\153\\ network, which is \nthe primary monitoring network for regional haze nationwide. The \nIMPROVE network provides a long-term record for tracking visibility \nimprovement or degradation. As discussed in the 2014 Plan, Texas \ncurrently relies on data collected through the IMPROVE network to \nsatisfy the regional haze monitoring requirements. The TCEQ reported \nobserved visibility data annually for Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains \nNational Parks to the EPA from the IMPROVE dataset and tracked the \nannual visibility index at both Class I areas for comparison of \nbaseline, current, and natural conditions. The TCEQ continues to track \nthese visibility trends at these sites and identified no future changes \nin this network. The EPA proposes to conclude that the State has \nadequately addressed the applicable provision under 40 CFR 51.308(g)(7) \nfor a visibility monitoring strategy.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\153\\ See 64 FR 35714, 35715 (July 1, 1999). Data from IMPROVE \nshow that visibility impairment caused by air pollution occurs \nvirtually all the time at most national parks and wilderness areas. \nThe average visual range in many Class I areas (i.e., national parks \nand memorial parks, wilderness areas, and international parks \nmeeting certain size criteria) in the western United States is 100-\n150 km, or about one-half to two-thirds of the visual range that \nwould exist without anthropogenic air pollution. In most of the \neastern Class I areas of the United States, the average visual range \nis less than 30 km, or about one-fifth of the visual range that \nwould exist under natural conditions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7. Determination of Adequacy of Existing Implementation Plan\n    At the same time a State is required to submit a progress report to \nthe EPA under 40 CFR 51.308(g), States must also make a declaration of \nadequacy regarding the existing implementation plan under 40 CFR \n51.308(h). Pursuant to 40 CFR 51.308(h), Texas provided a negative \ndeclaration under 40 CFR 51.308(h)(1) stating that no additional \ncontrols were necessary during the first implementation period and that \nthe existing 2009 Plan is adequate for continued progress toward the \nestablished RPGs for the Class I areas in Texas and for Class I areas \nin other States impacted by Texas emissions. Texas made this \ndetermination based on the analysis conducted showing the emission \nreductions and visibility improvement trends as detailed in the \npreceding sections. For the reasons discussed in section V.A of this \ndocument, we are proposing to approve Texas's 2009 Plan. In section V.A \nof this document, we explain why Texas's conclusion that additional \nmeasures are not necessary to meet the 2018 goals. Therefore, we are \nproposing to approve Texas's negative declaration that no further \nrevisions to the 2009 Plan are necessary under 40 CFR 51.308(h)(1).\n8. Consultation With Federal Land Managers\n    Section 40 CFR 51.308(i) requires the State to provide the \ndesignated FLMs with an opportunity for in-person consultation at least \nsixty days prior to holding any public hearings on a SIP revision for \nthe first implementation period. Texas consulted with FLMs on June 19, \n2013. The FLM comment period was from June 19, 2013, to August 20, \n2013, and comments were posted to the TCEQ website in August 2013. \nTexas held a public hearing on\n\n[[Page 22185]]\n\nSeptember 24, 2013. Texas considered and responded to all comments from \nFLMs, the EPA, and the public. The EPA proposes to conclude that Texas \nhas adequately satisfied the applicable FLM consultation provisions \nunder 40 CFR 51.308(i).\n9. Proposed Action\n    For the reasons set forth in section V.C of this document, the EPA \nis proposing to approve Texas's 2014 Plan as satisfying the progress \nreport SIP requirements for the first planning period contained in 40 \nCFR 51.308(g), (h), and (i).\n\nVI. Withdrawal of 2024 Proposed Partial Approval and Partial \nDisapproval\n\n    On July 20, 2021, the TCEQ submitted the 2021 Plan to address the \nState's regional haze obligations for the second planning period, which \nruns through 2028, in accordance with CAA sections 169A and the RHR at \n40 CFR 51.308(f). On October 15, 2024, the EPA proposed to partially \napprove and partially disapprove the 2021 Plan under the CAA and the \nRHR for the program's second implementation period. In that action, the \nEPA proposed to find that Texas's 2021 Plan did not meet all the \nRegional Haze requirements for the second planning period. \nSpecifically, the EPA proposed to disapprove the elements of the 2021 \nPlan related to requirements contained in 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2), (f)(3), \nand (i). The EPA proposed to approve the elements of the 2021 Plan \nrelated to requirements contained in 40 CFR 51.308(f)(1), (f)(4), \n(f)(5) \\154\\ and (f)(6). The action received several adverse comments. \nIn this notice of proposed rulemaking, the EPA is withdrawing our \nOctober 16, 2024, proposed partial approval and partial disapproval of \nTexas's 2021 Plan.\\155\\ We are now proposing to fully approve Texas's \n2021 Plan, based on a change in policy as first articulated in the \nrecent second planning period action for West Virginia \\156\\ as \ndiscussed in section VII.A of this document. Commenters who would like \nthe EPA to consider any comments submitted on the October 16, 2024, \nproposed rule must resubmit such comments during the comment period for \nthis proposed action.\\157\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\154\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(5) requires that the second planning \nperiod SIP revision address the requirements listed in paragraphs \n(g)(1) through (5).\n    \\155\\ 89 FR 83338 (October 15, 2024).\n    \\156\\ 90 FR 16478 (April 18, 2025).\n    \\157\\ The rulemaking docket for the now withdrawn action is \navailable under Docket ID EPA-R06-OAR-2021-0539 at \n<a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVII. The EPA's Evaluation and Proposed Action on Texas's 2021 Plan\n\nA. The EPA's Rationale for Proposing Approval\n\n    The EPA is proposing to approve Texas's submission because we have \ndetermined that Texas's 2021 Plan for the second planning period meets \nthe applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. In this proposed \naction, the EPA notes that it is the Agency's policy, as announced in \nthe EPA's recent proposed approval of the West Virginia Regional Haze \nSIP,\\158\\ that where visibility conditions for a Class I area impacted \nby a State are projected to be below the URP in 2028, and the State has \nconsidered the four statutory factors, the State has presumptively \ndemonstrated reasonable progress for the second implementation period \nfor that area. The EPA acknowledges that this reflects a change in \npolicy as to how the URP should be used in the evaluation of regional \nhaze second planning period SIPs. However, the EPA finds that this \npolicy better aligns with the purpose of the statute and RHR, which is \nachieving ``reasonable'' progress, not maximal progress, toward \nCongress's natural visibility goal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\158\\ 90 FR 16478 (April 18, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In developing the regulations required by CAA section 169A(b), the \nEPA established the concept of the uniform rate of progress, or URP, \nfor each Class I area. The URP is determined by drawing a straight line \nfrom the measured 2000-2004 baseline conditions (in deciviews) for the \n20% most impaired days at each Class I area to the estimated 20% most \nimpaired days natural conditions (in deciviews) in 2064. From this \ncalculation, a URP value can be calculated for each year between 2004 \nand 2064. For each Class I area, there is a regulatory requirement to \ncompare the projected visibility impairment (represented by the \nreasonable progress goal, or ``RPG'') at the end of each planning \nperiod to the URP (e.g., in 2028 for the second planning period).\\159\\ \n40 CFR 51.308(f)(1)(vi). If the projected RPG is above the URP, then an \nadditional ``robust demonstration'' requirement is triggered for each \nstate that contributes to that Class I area.\\160\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\159\\ We note that RPGs are a regulatory construct that we \ndeveloped to address statutory mandate in section 169B(e)(1), which \nrequired our regulations to include ``criteria for measuring \n`reasonable progress' toward the national goal.'' Under 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(3)(ii), RPGs measure the progress that is projected to be \nachieved by the control measures a State has determined are \nnecessary to make reasonable progress. Consistent with the 1999 RHR, \nthe RPGs are unenforceable, though they create a benchmark that \nallows for analytical comparisons to the URP and mid-implementation-\nperiod course corrections if necessary. 82 FR 3091-3092 (January 10, \n2017).\n    \\160\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(3)(ii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In this proposed action, the EPA is proposing to approve Texas's \n2021 Plan because the State evaluated potential additional measures, \nconsidered the four statutory factors, and the visibility conditions \nfor affected Class I areas are anticipated to be below the 2028 URP, \nthus supporting the State's decision regarding reasonable progress for \nthe second planning period.\n    The EPA has the discretion and authority to change policy. In FCC \nv. Fox Television Stations, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court plainly stated \nthat an agency is free to change a prior policy and ``need not \ndemonstrate . . . that the reasons for the new policy are better than \nthe reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is \npermissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and \nthat the agency believes it to be better.'' 566 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) \n(referencing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of United States, Inc. v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983)). See also Perez v. \nMortgage Bankers Assn., 135 S. Ct. 1199 (2015). As stated above, the \nEPA believes that its new policy here better aligns with the purpose of \nthe statute and RHR, which is achieving ``reasonable'' progress, not \nmaximal progress, toward Congress's natural visibility goal.\n    In the 2017 RHR Revisions, the EPA addressed the role of the URP as \nit relates to a State's development of its second planning period \nSIP.\\161\\ Specifically, in response to comments suggesting that the URP \nshould be considered a ``safe harbor'' and relieve States of any \nobligation to consider the four statutory factors, the EPA explained \nthat the URP was not intended to be such a safe harbor.\\162\\ The EPA \nsummarized such comments as follows:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\161\\ 82 FR 3078 (January 10, 2017).\n    \\162\\ 82 FR 3078, 3099 (January 10, 2017).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Some commenters stated a desire for corresponding rule text dealing \nwith situations where RPGs are equal to (``on'') or better than \n(``below'') the URP or glidepath. Several commenters stated that the \nURP or glidepath should be a ``safe harbor,'' opining that states \nshould be permitted to analyze whether projected visibility conditions \nfor the end of the implementation period will be on or below the \nglidepath based on on-the-books or on-the-way control measures, and \nthat in such cases a four-factor analysis should not be required.'' Id.\n    Other comments indicated a similar approach, such as ``a somewhat\n\n[[Page 22186]]\n\nnarrower entrance to a `safe harbor,' by suggesting that if current \nvisibility conditions are already below the end-of-planning-period \npoint on the URP line, a four-factor analysis should not be required.'' \nId. The EPA was clear in its response: ``We do not agree with either of \nthese recommendations.'' The EPA explained its position as follows: \n``The CAA requires that each SIP revision contain long-term strategies \nfor making reasonable progress, and that in determining reasonable \nprogress states must consider the four statutory factors. Treating the \nURP as a safe harbor would be inconsistent with the statutory \nrequirement that states assess the potential to make further reasonable \nprogress towards natural visibility goal in every implementation \nperiod.'' Id. (footnote omitted).\n    However, so long as a State considers the four factors, neither the \nCAA nor the RHR prohibit the presumption that a Class I area below the \nURP is achieving reasonable progress. Indeed, we think such a policy \nbetter aligns with the statutory goal while recognizing the \nconsiderable improvements in visibility impairment that have been made \nby a wide variety of State and federal programs in recent decades.\n    The EPA's determinations are described in more detail in following \nportions of section VII of this document.\n\nB. Identification of Class I Areas\n\n    Section 169A(b)(2) of the CAA requires each state in which any \nClass I area is located or ``the emissions from which may reasonably be \nanticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility'' in \na Class I area to have a plan for making reasonable progress toward the \nnational visibility goal. The RHR implements this statutory requirement \nat 40 CFR 51.308(f), which provides that each state's plan ``must \naddress regional haze in each mandatory Class I Federal area located \nwithin the State and in each mandatory Class I Federal area located \noutside the State that may be affected by emissions from within the \nState,'' and paragraph (f)(2), which requires each state's plan to \ninclude a long-term strategy that addresses regional haze in such Class \nI areas.\n    The EPA concluded in the 1999 RHR that ``all [s]tates contain \nsources whose emissions are reasonably anticipated to contribute to \nregional haze in a Class I area,'' \\163\\ and this determination was not \nchanged in the 2017 RHR. Critically, the statute and regulation both \nrequire that the cause-or-contribute assessment consider all emissions \nof visibility impairing pollutants from a state, as opposed to \nemissions of a particular pollutant or emissions from a certain set of \nsources.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\163\\ 64 FR 35714, 35721 (July 1, 1999).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    To address 40 CFR 51.308(f), Texas identified the two mandatory \nClass I areas within its borders, Big Bend National Park (Big Bend) and \nGuadalupe Mountains National Park (Guadalupe Mountains). Both parks are \nlocated in west Texas. Big Bend National Park (Big Bend) is in Brewster \nCounty and borders the Rio Grande and Mexico. Guadalupe Mountains \nNational Park (Guadalupe Mountains) is in Culberson County and borders \nNew Mexico. Both are managed by the National Park Service.\n    In addition to the two Class I areas in Texas, the TCEQ conducted \narea of influence analyses (AOIs) paired with emissions-over-distance \n(Q/d) analyses for 11 Class I areas in other states including \nLouisiana, Arkansas, Colorado, Missouri, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. The \nAOIs were generated using ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate \nextinction-weighted residence times (EWRT).\\164\\ The Class I areas \nincluded in the analysis from Texas and neighboring states are \npresented in Table 10, which is taken from Table 7-3: Class I Areas \nincluded in AOI Analyses of the 2021 Texas Regional Haze Plan.\\165\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\164\\ 2021 Plan at 7-6.

While we \npreviously raised some concerns in our now-withdrawn 2024 proposal \nabout Texas not specifically identifying the Bosque del Apache (BOAP) \nClass I area in New Mexico, Texas's 2021 Plan did identify multiple \nClass I areas in New Mexico, including the Salt Creek Wilderness Area \nand the White Mountain Wilderness Area. BOAP is further west than the \nClass I areas Texas considered, and further from Texas, resulting in \nlarger distance (d) from Texas sources and lower Q/d values that would \nnot have resulted in any additional sources being selected for further \nevaluation using the four statutory factors. Upon further review of \nTexas's 2021 Plan, the EPA is proposing that Texas adequately addressed \nthe elements of 40 CFR 51.308(f) and (f)(2) regarding identification of \nClass I areas within the State and outside the State that may be \naffected by emission from within Texas.\n\n[[Page 22187]]\n\nC. Calculations of Baseline, Current, and Natural Visibility \nConditions; Progress to Date; and the Uniform Rate of Progress\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(1) requires states to determine the following for \n``each mandatory Class I Federal area located within the State'': \nbaseline visibility conditions for the most impaired and clearest days, \nnatural visibility conditions for the most impaired and clearest days, \nprogress to date for the most impaired and clearest days, the \ndifferences between current visibility conditions and natural \nvisibility conditions, and the URP. This section also provides the \noption for states to propose adjustments to the URP line for a Class I \narea to account for visibility impacts from anthropogenic sources \noutside the United States and/or the impacts from wildland prescribed \nfires that were conducted for certain, specified objectives.\\166\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\166\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(1)(vi)(B).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In Chapter 4 of the 2021 Texas Regional Haze Plan, Texas determines \nand presents the baseline, natural, and current visibility conditions \nfor both the 20 percent most anthropogenically impaired days and the 20 \npercent clearest days for the State's two Class I Areas consistent with \nthe EPA's RHR and guidance. In the 2021 Texas Regional Haze Plan, Texas \nused visibility data from IMPROVE monitoring sites to calculate \nbaseline visibility conditions. Consistent with the RHR, Texas \ncalculated baseline visibility based on data from 2000-2004. For Big \nBend specifically, baseline visibility conditions are based on valid \ndata for 2001 through 2004 because 2000 did not meet completeness \ncriteria.\\167\\ Baseline visibility indices for Big Bend and Guadalupe \nMountains are presented in the 2021 Texas Regional Haze Plan in Table \n4-4. In our review, we identified that the information provided by \nTexas in Chapter 4 of its 2021 Regional Haze Plan as to the baseline \nand current conditions on the 20 percent clearest days is inconsistent \nwith the IMPROVE monitoring data and information presented in Chapter \n8. Based on the information in Table 8-42 of the 2021 Regional Haze \nPlan, Texas identifies the correct data set for where this information \nis located but presents the incorrect data in Chapter 4. Based on the \ndata source that Texas identified in Chapter 8, we present information \nin Tables 11-13 consistent with information in Chapter 8 of its Plan \nand the IMPROVE monitoring data.\\168\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\167\\ See 2021 Texas Regional Haze Plan at 4-4.\n    \\168\\ <a href=\"https://views.cira.colostate.edu/fed/\">https://views.cira.colostate.edu/fed/</a>.

As explained in greater detail in \nthe 2020 Ramboll modeling report, this approach generally involves at \nleast two or three model runs: one ``base case'' run (2016 in this \ncase) with all emissions, one future base case run (2028 in this case) \nwith all the future case emissions, and one with anthropogenic \nemissions from outside of the U.S. removed from the future base case \nsimulation ``zero-out''.\\173\\ The difference between these simulations \nprovides an estimate of the air quality impact due to the international \nanthropogenic emissions.\\174\\ Texas's adjusted URP for Big Bend and \nGuadalupe Mountains are presented in Figures 8-28 and 8-29 of its 2021 \nTexas Regional Haze Plan.

Long-Term Strategy for Regional Haze\n\n1. Four Factor Analysis\n    Each state having a Class I area within its borders or emissions \nthat may affect visibility in a Class I area must develop a long-term \nstrategy for making reasonable progress towards the national visibility \ngoal.\\178\\ The long-term strategy ``must include the enforceable \nemissions limitations, compliance schedules, and other measures that \nare necessary to make reasonable progress, as determined pursuant to \n(f)(2)(i) through (iv).'' \\179\\ The amount of progress that is \n``reasonable progress'' is based on consideration of the four statutory \nfactors in CAA section 169A(g)(1) in an evaluation of potential control \noptions for sources of visibility impairing pollutants, which is \nreferred to as a ``four-factor'' analysis. After considering the four \nstatutory factors, all measures that are determined to be necessary to \nmake reasonable progress must be in the long-term strategy.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\178\\ CAA section 169A(b)(2)(B).\n    \\179\\ 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(2)(i) provides the requirements for the four-\nfactor analysis. The first step of this analysis entails selecting the \nsources to be evaluated for emission reduction measures. The RHR \nprovides states flexibility in selecting sources, and to that end, 40 \nCFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) requires States to provide a description of the \ncriteria it used to determine which sources or groups of sources it \nwill consider for potential four-factor control analysis. A threshold \nquestion at this step is which visibility impairing pollutants will be \nanalyzed. Texas focused on NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> emissions \nfrom point sources in its control strategy analysis for the second \nplanning period. Texas explained these are the main anthropogenic \npollutants that affect visibility at Class I areas in Texas and Class I \nareas in neighboring states. Texas further stated that, ``on an \nindividual basis, point sources are the largest contributors to \nSO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF>,'' and thus\n\n[[Page 22189]]\n\nTexas elected to focus on point sources in this planning period.\\180\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\180\\ 2021 Texas Regional Haze Plan at 7-3.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    To determine the necessary emission reductions measures, a state \nmust first select the sources to evaluate. Texas's source selection \nmethodology relied on a two-step approach. As the first step for source \nselection, Texas developed NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> areas of \ninfluence (AOIs) for thirteen \\181\\ Class I areas (in Texas and nearby \nstates) to identify areas that may contain sources of NO<INF>X</INF> \nand SO<INF>2</INF> that were expected to contribute to visibility \nimpairment at these areas. The AOIs are graphical representations of \nthe extinction weighted residence time (EWRT), which combines air flow \npatterns with ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate extinction measured \nat IMPROVE monitors at the Class I areas on the 20% most impaired days. \nAt the second step, Texas then applied a Q/d threshold for \nNO<INF>X</INF> and for SO<INF>2</INF> of greater than or equal to five \nto point sources located within the geographical area of the selected \nAOI threshold.\\182\\ Following this methodology, Texas selected 18 \nsources for further analysis of controls for either NO<INF>X</INF> \nemissions, SO<INF>2</INF> emissions, or both depending on whether the \nsource had a Q/d over 5 for either NO<INF>X</INF> or SO<INF>2</INF> and \nwas within the relevant AOI.\\183\\ Put another way, if a source was \nwithin the AOI and above the Q/d threshold for NO<INF>X</INF>, this \ntriggered analysis for potential control retrofit or production changes \nfor that pollutant. If an emissions unit triggered analysis for both \nNO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF>, control strategies for both \npollutants were analyzed separately and concurrently.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\181\\ As discussed previously in section IV.C. of this document, \nthe monitor for Guadalupe Mountains also serves as the monitor for \nCarlsbad Caverns in New Mexico.\n    \\182\\ To calculate the Q/d for point sources, the TCEQ used 2028 \nprojected emissions (Q in tons per year) and distance from the Class \nI area monitor to the source (d in kilometers). For non-EGUs, Texas \nestimated 2028 future year emissions from 2016 reported emissions \nfrom the State of Texas Air Reporting System (STARS) coupled with \ngrowth factors developed by the consulting firm, Eastern Research \nGroup, Inc. (ERG) See 2021 Texas Regional Haze Plan at 7-9. For \nEGUs, the TCEQ used data from the Eastern Regional Technical \nAdvisory Committee (ERTAC) to estimate EGU projections for 2028. See \n2021 Texas Regional Haze Plan at 7-9. Additional information that \nTexas used in developing its 2021 Plan is available in the docket \nfor this action.\n    \\183\\ 2021 Plan, at 7-2--7-9.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Texas conducted analyses that evaluated potential emission \nreduction measures using the four statutory factors for 15 out of the \n18 selected sources.\\184\\ For EGUs, Texas considered and evaluated dry \nsorbent injection (DSI) at a 90% control efficiency, spray dryer \nabsorber (SDA) at a 95% control efficiency, and wet limestone scrubbing \nsystems (wet FGD) at a 98% control efficiency as potential \nSO<INF>2</INF> control options, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) \nat a 98% control efficiency and selective non-catalytic reduction \n(SNCR) at a 50% control efficiency as potential NO<INF>X</INF> \ncontrols.\\185\\ For EGUs with existing SO<INF>2</INF> controls, Texas \nconsidered and evaluated upgrading the control efficiency of the \nexisting controls to achieve a control efficiency of 95%.\\186\\ For non-\nEGUs, Texas considered various NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> \ncontrol options depending on the type of source and whether it had \nexisting controls.\\187\\ For three of the sources, the Orange Carbon \nBlack Plant, the Oxbow Coke Calcining Plant, and the Streetman \nLightweight Aggregate Plant, Texas determined that there were no \ntechnically feasible controls.\\188\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\184\\ For one EGU, Oak Grove Steam Electric Station, Texas \ndetermined that both units at the source already operated wet \nlimestone scrubbers that are achieving over 98 percent control \nefficiency.

Therefore, if the state has \nconsidered the four statutory factors and a Class I area is below the \nURP, it has presumptively made reasonable progress for the planning \nperiod. In this instance, because Texas presumptively made and will \ncontinue to make reasonable progress for this planning period, it thus \nfollows that it is reasonable for Texas to conclude that additional \nemission measures are not necessary to make reasonable progress, and \ntherefore, additional emission measures are not necessary for inclusion \nin Texas's long-term strategy for the second planning period. Overall \npoint source inventory trends based on Texas's annual inventory also \nsupports the idea that visibility conditions are likely to continue to \nimprove. Table 17 of this document shows the point source emission data \nof NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> from 2018 to 2023.\n\n                                                Table 17--Texas Point Source Emissions Data (NOX and SO2)\n                                                                     [2018 to 2023]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     Pollutant (tpy)                           2018            2019            2020            2021            2022            2023\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSO2.....................................................         282,000         215,000         192,000         212,000         188,000         159,000\nNOX.....................................................         248,000         240,000         217,000         218,000         222,000         213,000\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As illustrated in Table 17 of this document, SO<INF>2</INF> \nemissions from point sources decreased 123,000 tons over the five-year \nperiod between 2018 and 2023. Similarly, NO<INF>X</INF> emissions \ndecreased over 30,000 tons over the same five-year period. Given that \nSO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> are the main anthropogenic pollutants \nthat affect visibility at Class I areas in Texas and Class I areas in \nneighboring states, these trends in emissions from point sources \nsupport the decision that additional emission measures are not \nnecessary for inclusion in Texas's long-term strategy for the second \nplanning period.\n    In light of these facts and EPA's new policy approach, the EPA \nagrees with Texas's conclusion that no additional control measures are \nnecessary for inclusion in its long-term strategy and that emission \nreductions from state and federal programs already in place are \nsufficient to make reasonable progress during the second planning \nperiod.\n2. Salt Creek Wilderness Area\n    In developing their second planning period SIP revisions, States \nrelied on photochemical modeling to project future visibility \nconditions and evaluate the impact of identified emissions reductions \non visibility in Class I areas. The TCEQ performed its own \nphotochemical modeling with the assistance of a contractor (Ramboll). \nBecause of the time intensive nature of photochemical modeling, the \nTCEQ began the modeling process well in advance of the July 31, 2021, \ndeadline set forth in the Regional Haze Rule for states to submit SIP \nrevisions for the\n\n[[Page 22191]]\n\nsecond planning period.\\203\\ Texas's 2021 Plan identified that the \nprojected 2028 visibility conditions for Class I areas influenced by \nemissions from Texas sources are all below the adjusted uniform rate of \nprogress (URP) except for the Salt Creek Wilderness Area in New Mexico \n(Salt Creek).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\203\\ Information on Texas's modeling can be found in Chapter 8 \nof its 2021 Plan, appendices D-G of its 2021 Plan, and the Ramboll \nFinal Report: Regional Haze Modeling to Evaluate Progress in \nImproving Visibility (June 25, 2020). The Ramboll Final Report is \nincluded in the docket for this action.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In addition to the modeling the TCEQ performed, there was other \nphotochemical modeling conducted for use by States as part of their \nsecond planning period SIP revisions. For example, the Western Regional \nAir Partnership (WRAP) conducted modeling that was used by several \nmember states in developing their second planning period plans, \nincluding New Mexico.\\204\\ The EPA also conducted photochemical \nmodeling in 2019, for states to use if they wished, that provided \nvisibility projections for all Class I areas, including Salt \nCreek.\\205\\ Similar to Texas, both WRAP and EPA began the modeling \nprocess well in advance of the July 31, 2021, deadline set forth in the \nRegional Haze Rule for states to submit SIP revisions for the second \nplanning period with Texas developing and finalizing their modeling \nearlier than the WRAP modeling that New Mexico is utilizing. Likewise, \nthe EPA's modeling was completed and shared in 2019 prior to the TCEQ \nor WRAP modeling being completed.\\206\\ As such, the emissions inventory \nand anticipated reductions included in the modeling were based on \ninformation known at the time, and therefore, the modeled values for \n2028 at Salt Creek are different for the Texas and WRAP/New Mexico, and \nEPA modeling. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that all three of these \nmodeling analyses would have differences in visibility projections for \nSalt Creek in 2028 as well differences in how they adjusted the URP \nglidepath.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\204\\ Multiple sources available on WRAP Technical Support \nSystem <a href=\"https://views.cira.colostate.edu/tssv2/\">https://views.cira.colostate.edu/tssv2/</a>.

To date, New Mexico has gone out for public comment on its draft \nregional haze plan for the second planning period and is working \ntowards a final plan to submit to EPA.\\207\\ Thus, at the time Texas \nsubmitted its 2021 Plan, Texas could not know for certain whether New \nMexico would project that visibility conditions at Salt Creek would be \nabove the adjusted URP glidepath in 2028 in its second planning period \nSIP.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\207\\ Information on the status of New Mexico's Second Planning \nPeriod SIP Revision can be found at <a href=\"https://www.env.nm.gov/air-quality/reg-haze/\">https://www.env.nm.gov/air-quality/reg-haze/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    While the TCEQ's modeling, the WRAP modeling that New Mexico is \nusing, and the EPA modeling project that the visibility conditions in \n2028 at Salt Creek will be above their respective adjusted glidepaths, \nthe three models have different projected visibility conditions in 2028 \nas well as different adjusted URPs. As a result, the EPA has performed \nsome additional analysis that considers the different modeling \nconducted by the TCEQ, WRAP, and the EPA of Salt Creek visibility \nconditions. In addition, EPA analyzed more recent monitoring data and \ntrends at Salt Creek. The EPA's full analysis is presented in a \ntechnical memorandum, ``EPA's Salt Creek Supplemental Analysis \nMemorandum'', included in the docket for this action (EPA Salt Creek \nMemo).\\208\\ We summarize our analysis in the following paragraphs. We \nconclude that based on consideration of recent visibility trends at \nSalt Creek, conservativism in the TCEQ's modeling, and additional \nemission reductions not captured by any of the models used to project \nvisibility conditions in 2028, the 2028 visibility projection for Salt \nCreek is likely to be on or below the adjusted 2028 URP glidepath.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\208\\ EPA analysis of Salt Creek National Wildlife Refuge \nModeling and Monitoring Data related to 2028 Uniform Rate of \nProgress in Review of Texas Second Regional Haze SIP, available in \nthe docket for this action.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Because of the time intensive nature of photochemical modeling, the \nTCEQ began the modeling process well in advance of the July 31, 2021, \ndeadline set forth in the RHR for States to submit SIP revisions for \nthe second planning period. Because several years have passed since the \nmodeling was performed, with the TCEQ's modeling using 2014-2018 \nmonitoring data for projection to the 2028 future case (just five years \nfrom the most recent monitoring data), it is useful to consider and \ncompare more recent monitoring data and trends with the visibility \nprojections provided by the modeling. More recent monitoring data from \nthe IMPROVE monitoring network indicates that visibility conditions at \nSalt Creek are improving at a faster rate than the modeling projected \nfor Salt Creek. The recent IMPROVE data from Salt Creek for the latest \n5-year average (2019-2023) is 14.3 dv.\\209\\ In Table 18, we include a \nsummary of the recent monitoring data compared to the projected \nvisibility conditions in 2028 from the three different models mentioned \nabove.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\209\\ ``SaltCreek_Monitored Visibility Data.xlsx'' is available \nin the docket for this action.\n    \\210\\ EPA's guidance indicated a preferred approach that yields \n13.8 dv in this case.

In fact, the 2019-2023 \nmonitoring value is currently below the adjusted 2023 glidepath based \non two of the three modeling analyses.\\211\\ Extrapolating the annual \naverage most impaired days to the future, the 2028 visibility \nconditions are extrapolated to be 13.4 dv.\\212\\ Based on these trends, \nnatural conditions (as adjusted by Texas) would be reached earlier than \n2064. See EPA's Salt Creek Memo for a figure illustrating this \nextrapolation. Using this extrapolation approach also shows that \nvisibility conditions in 2028 would be below Texas's adjusted glidepath \nin 2028 as well as New Mexico's and EPA's 2028 adjusted glidepath. \nThus, the recent monitoring data trends show that visibility conditions \nat Salt Creek will likely not only be better than what any of the three \nmodels projected but will also be below each of the adjusted glidepaths \ncalculated using the TCEQ, WRAP, or EPA modeling.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\211\\ The 2023 adjusted glidepath point in this table is \nactually based on 2019-2023 data and since the modeling projections \nuse the range of data two year prior to two years after, this \nmonitoring data could be potentially considered to be representative \nof the 2021 results and glidepath point that would be higher and \nthus indicating that the monitoring data is even further below the \nglidepath.\n    \\212\\ ``SaltCreek_Monitored Visibility Data.xlsx'' is available \nin the docket for this action. See also EPA's Salt Creek Memo.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    While the recent monitoring data indicates Salt Creek is trending \nto be below the glidepath (if the monitoring trends continue), in the \nSalt Creek memo we also evaluated the model setup and inputs of the \nTexas modeling compared to the modeling conducted by WRAP and the EPA. \nIn this document, we highlight a few important points. First, we note \nthat while the TCEQ's modeling projected Salt Creek to be above the \n2028 glidepath point, its adjustment to the 2064 endpoint was less than \nboth the WRAP/New Mexico and the EPA's adjustments. In other words, the \nTCEQ's analysis includes the smallest adjustment of the three 2064 \nendpoints and is thus more conservative than the WRAP and EPA \nadjustment. As explained in the EPA's 2018 technical guidance for \ntracking visibility progress,\\213\\ there are several potential ways to \nquantify international anthropogenic impacts in Class I areas. The \nsimplest approach is to perform brute force ``zero-out'' model runs, \nwhich involves at least two model runs: one ``base case'' run with all \nemissions, and one with anthropogenic emissions from outside of the \nU.S. removed from the original base case simulation. The difference \nbetween these simulations provides an estimate of the air quality \nimpact due to the international anthropogenic emissions. An alternative \napproach to isolating international anthropogenic impacts in \nphotochemical grid models is ``photochemical source apportionment.'' \nSource apportionment can be used to directly track PM formed from \ninternational anthropogenic emissions sources in a single model run.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\213\\ Technical Guidance on Tracking Visibility Progress for the \nSecond Implementation Period of the Regional Haze Program (December \n20, 2018), <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-12/documents/technical_guidance_tracking_visibility_progress.pdf\">https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-12/documents/technical_guidance_tracking_visibility_progress.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The EPA and WRAP used source apportionment tools to assess \ninternational emissions in the CAMx modeling domain. The TCEQ, on the \nother hand, did a base run and a zero-out run that set all \ninternational anthropogenic emissions within the CAMx modeling domain \nto zero.\\214\\ Texas then calculated the difference between the two \nmodel runs to quantify the international anthropogenic emissions impact \nin the CAMx modeling domain. While both approaches are technically \nappropriate, the TCEQ's zero-out modeling approach of removing \nemissions from international sources has an impact on the amount of \nammonia available to react with U.S. emissions to form visibility \nimpairing particulate. The removal of these emissions increases the \namount of ammonia available to react with the U.S. anthropogenic \nemissions. Because of this, it is likely that the TCEQ's zero-out \napproach results in more light extinction attributed to the U.S. \nmodeled emission sources and underestimates the total contribution from \ninternational anthropogenic emissions. This would result in the 2064 \nadjusted endpoint being lower and a steeper adjusted glide path (and \nlower 2028 URP value). In other words, if Texas's modeling used source \napportionment instead of zero-out, the 2028 adjusted glidepath would be \nhigher than 13.5 dv, thus making it more likely that the TCEQ's \nmodeling results (considering other issues mentioned elsewhere in this \ndocument) and the extrapolated monitor data would be further below the \nglidepath in 2028.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\214\\ Ramboll Final Report: Regional Haze Modeling to Evaluate \nProgress in Improving Visibility (June 25, 2020), pg. 27.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Second, Texas also included several conservative assumptions in the \n2028 future year inventory it created that led to a conservatively \n(high) projection of 2028 visibility conditions at Salt Creek. \nSpecifically, in creating its 2028 future year emissions inventory, \nTexas did not rely on a projection of 2028 emissions for point sources \nin Texas. Rather, Texas used emissions of NO<INF>X</INF> and \nSO<INF>2</INF> consistent with 2018 levels for EGU point sources and \nmostly 2016 levels for non-EGU point sources. This is different from \nthe photochemical modeling that WRAP and the EPA conducted, which \nincluded projections of emissions for Texas point sources in 2028. \nTable 19 includes emission totals for Texas EGUs NO<INF>X</INF> and \nSO<INF>2</INF> emissions in both the base case \\215\\ (TCEQ and EPA) and \nbaseline (WRAP/New Mexico), and 2028 future year inventories.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\215\\ The TCEQ and the EPA both modeled a 2016 base case period \nfor which they developed a base case emission inventory. The WRAP \nmodeled 2014 as their base case period and developed a 2014 emission \ninventory for that modeling. The WRAP wanted to use emissions from a \nmore recent period to use as the base period for doing projections \nto the future with the modeling. As a result, they modified the 2014 \nbase case inventory to be representative of 2016 thus creating a \nbaseline emission inventory. Using a baseline emission inventory \nallowed the use of monitoring data from a more recent period of \n2014-2018, instead of 2012-2016, which is expected to help reduce \npotential errors in forecasting future year projections of emissions \nand visibility impairment.\n\n                         Table 19--NOX and SO2 Texas EGU Sector Annual Emissions Modeled\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Baseline (WRAP)/basecase       2028 Future year Texas EGUs\n                                                         (TCEQ) Texas EGUs       -------------------------------\n                                                 --------------------------------\n                                                     NOX (tpy)       SO2 (tpy)       NOX (tpy)       SO2 (tpy)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWRAP/NM.........................................         103,221         232,284          73,361         120,502\nTCEQ............................................         100,469         245,469          99,601         210,686\n\n[[Page 22193]]\n\n \nEPA (2019)......................................         111,612         248,158          86,701         133,234\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As indicated in Table 19 of this document, the base case/base line \nemissions of NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> annual emissions for \nTexas EGUs was relatively similar, but there is a large difference in \nthe future year modeled values with the TCEQ's modeling on the order of \n87,000-90,000 more tons of SO<INF>2</INF> per year than the other two. \nThis would result in larger impacts from Texas sources in the future \nyear modeling. If emission levels similar to the WRAP/New Mexico or EPA \nmodeled rates were used in the TCEQ's 2028 modeled projections, the \nTCEQ's modeling projections for 2028 would be expected to be lower.\n    The EPA has also looked at recent annual EGU emissions to compare \nwith the 2028 Texas EGU modeled emissions. The EPA Clean Air Markets \nDivision Data for 2022 through 2024 indicates Texas EGUs actual \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions have ranged from 82,876 to 87,176 tpy, which \nis similar to 2028 modeled emission levels. However, Texas EGU \nSO<INF>2</INF> emissions for the same recent period have ranged from \n128,344 tpy in 2022 to 88,164 tpy in 2024, which is much lower than the \n2028 modeled emission totals from the WRAP/New Mexico and the EPA's \nmodeling, and less than half of what the TCEQ modeled. Thus, the TCEQ \nmodeled visibility projections for 2028 are conservatively high.\n    Finally, the modeling conducted did not factor in more recent \nemission reductions that have occurred in New Mexico. Specifically, \noperational changes at Eunice Gas Plant, Denton Gas Plant, and Saunders \nGas Plant have resulted in emission reductions of over 2,300 tpy of \nSO<INF>2</INF> and over 900 tpy of NO<INF>X</INF>.\\216\\ These sources \nare located near Salt Creek in southeast New Mexico, and therefore, \nwill have an impact on visibility conditions in Salt Creek.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\216\\ See appendix C of New Mexico's draft SIP revision dated \nAugust 26, 2024. This appendix is included in the docket for this \naction. We are including this appendix as it shows emissions data \nfor the relevant sources. In this action we are not evaluating or \nassessing the approvability of NMED's draft SIP.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In conclusion, visibility conditions in 2028 will be below the \nadjusted glidepaths for Salt Creek based on an extrapolation of recent \nmonitoring data. Additionally, conservative assumptions and approaches \nutilized in Texas's modeling resulted in both a smaller adjustment to \nits URP as well as less modeled visibility improvement projected in \n2028. Had Texas used similar modeling assumptions and approaches to \nWRAP and the EPA, the modeled result would have likely shown greater \nvisibility improvement and a higher adjustment to the URP glidepath \nduring the course of the planning period. Based on this information, \nvisibility conditions in 2028 at Salt Creek are anticipated to be below \nthe adjusted glidepath.\n3. Additional Long-Term Strategy Requirements\n    Section 51.308(f)(2)(ii) provides that States must consult with \nother States that are reasonably anticipated to contribute to \nvisibility impairment in a Class I area to develop coordinated emission \nmanagement strategies containing the emission reductions measures that \nare necessary to make reasonable progress. Section 51.308(f)(2)(ii)(A) \nand (B) require States to consider the emission reduction measures \nidentified by other States as necessary for reasonable progress and to \ninclude agreed upon measures in their SIPs. Section 51.308(f)(2)(ii)(C) \nrequires a State to document in its SIP submission all substantive \nconsultations with other contributing States and also speaks to what \nhappens if States cannot agree on what measures are necessary to make \nreasonable progress. Texas's 2021 Plan included documentation of its \nconsultation calls, written communications, and presentations with the \nother states, including Oklahoma, Arkansas, and New Mexico, which \noccurred from the spring of 2020 through the spring of 2021.\\217\\ \nDuring this consultation period, no agreements with other states were \nmade as to any control measures. To the extent that states or RPOs \nsubmitted comments or made requests to the State, Texas responded to \nthose concerns, as evidenced in the 2021 Plan and appendix A to the \n2021 Plan. Therefore, the EPA proposes to approve the portions of the \n2021 Plan relating to 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(ii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\217\\ 2021 Plan, Chapter 3, at 3-1 and appendix A, p. A-2 \nthrough A-3.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(2)(iii) requires that States document the \ntechnical basis, on which they are relying on. As part of this, 40 CFR \n51.038 308(f)(2)(iii) requires the emissions information considered to \ndetermine the measures that are necessary to make reasonable progress \ninclude information on emissions for the most recent year for which the \nstate has submitted triennial emissions data to the EPA (or a more \nrecent year), with a twelve-month exemption period for newly submitted \ndata. As discussed earlier in this section, Texas performed cost \nanalysis as detailed in appendix B and Chapter 7 of its 2021 Plan. \nAdditionally, Texas performed photochemical modeling as detailed in \nChapter 8 and appendices E-G of its 2021 Plan. Texas's SIP submission \nincluded 2011, 2014, and 2017 statewide NEI emission data for \nNO<INF>X</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, PM, VOCs and NH<INF>3</INF>.\\218\\ For \nthe base case PSAT modeling, Texas also relied on a combination of 2016 \nand 2018 emissions data depending on the type of source. Additionally, \nthe TCEQ requested regulated entities submit revisions to the 2016- or \n2018-point source emission inventory by January 2019 to incorporate \nupdates into their modeling. The TCEQ received no revisions to the EGU \ninventory, and the non-EGU revisions totaled less than one ton per day \neach of VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions. Therefore, the EPA proposes \nto approve the portions of the 2021 Plan relating to 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)(iii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\218\\ 2021 Plan, Chapter 6.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(2)(iv) requires states to consider the following \nadditional factors in developing its long-term strategy: (1) emission \nreductions due to ongoing air pollution control programs, including \nmeasures to address reasonably attributable visibility impairment; (2) \nmeasures to mitigate the impacts of construction activities; (3) source \nretirement and replacement schedules; (4) basic smoke management \npractices for prescribed fire used for agricultural and wildland \nvegetation management purposes and smoke management programs; and (5) \nthe anticipated net effect on visibility due to\n\n[[Page 22194]]\n\nprojected changes in point, area, and mobile source emissions over the \nperiod addressed by the long-term strategy. Texas reasonably considered \nthese factors in its SIP submittal.\\219\\ Thus, the EPA proposes to \napprove the portions of the 2021 Plan relating to 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)(iv).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\219\\ See Texas's 2021 Plan, Chapter 7, Section 7.6. Also, Texas \ndiscusses the anticipated effect of emissions reductions due to the \nlong-term strategy on visibility, as required by 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)(iv)(E), in Chapter 8.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Based on the reasoning described in section VII.A and D in this \ndocument, EPA is proposing that Texas has met the requirements of 40 \nCFR 51.308(f)(2).\n\nE. Reasonable Progress Goals\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(3) contains the requirements pertaining to RPGs \nfor each Class I area. Section 51.308(f)(3)(i) requires a State in \nwhich a Class I area is located to establish RPGs--one each for the \nmost impaired and clearest days--reflecting the visibility conditions \nthat will be achieved at the end of the implementation period as a \nresult of the emission limitations, compliance schedules and other \nmeasures required under paragraph (f)(2) to be in States' long-term \nstrategies, as well as implementation of other CAA requirements. The \nlong-term strategies as reflected by the RPGs must provide for an \nimprovement in visibility on the most impaired days relative to the \nbaseline period and ensure no degradation on the clearest days relative \nto the baseline period.\n    Texas identified 2028 RPGs for its two Class I areas in deciviews \nfor the 20 percent most impaired days and the 20 percent clearest days \nin Chapter 8 of its 2021 Plan, respectively, which are below the 2028 \nURP value for each Class I area. The RPGs reflect emissions reductions \nfrom state and federal programs already in place. Table 20, in this \ndocument, summarizes the 2028 RPGs and 2028 URP for Texas's Class I \nareas.\n\n                                       Table 20--Texas Class I Areas RPGs\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        2028 RPG for 20%\n                 Class I area                     2028 RPG for 20%     most impaired days   2028 Uniform rate of\n                                                 clearest days (dv)           (dv)           progress (URP) (dv)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBig Bend National Park........................                  4.92                 14.16                  14.4\nGuadalupe Mountains National Park.............                  4.05                 12.23                  12.8\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Figures 8-28 and 8-29 of Texas's 2021 Plan show the URP for the 20 \npercent most impaired days for Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains. The \nState established 2028 RPGs (expressed in deciviews) that reflect the \nvisibility conditions projected to be achieved by the end of the second \nplanning period. Texas's RPGs illustrate improvement in visibility for \nthe 20 percent most impaired days since the baseline period (2000-2004) \nand demonstrate that there is no degradation in visibility for the 20 \npercent clearest days since the baseline period. Therefore, the EPA is \nproposing to approve Texas's 2028 RPGs for the 20 percent most impaired \ndays and the 20 percent clearest days as required by 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(3)(i).\n    Section 51.308(f)(3)(ii) requires that when a State establishes an \nRPG for a Class I area that provides for a slower rate of improvement \nthan the URP, each State contributing to visibility impairment in that \nClass I area provide ``a robust demonstration'' that additional \nemission reduction measures are not reasonable to include in its SIP. \nWhile Texas's modeling indicated that the Salt Creek wilderness area \nmay be above the URP in 2028, at the time Texas submitted the SIP in \n2021, New Mexico had not established an RPG for the Salt Creek Class I \narea. Thus, Texas had no way of knowing whether a robust demonstration \nwould be required at the time it submitted its SIP. Texas highlighted \nas much in its 2021 Plan and during its consultation with New \nMexico.\\220\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\220\\ 2021 Plan, at 8-59 to 8-60.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The RHR does not specify what is required as part of a robust \ndemonstration other than a reference that the State document how the \nfour statutory factors were taken into consideration. In our 2019 \nguidance document, we explained that we did not interpret the robust \ndemonstration requirement to mean that ``a State must weigh the four \nfactors differently'' and the SIP submission could provide an \nexplanation that the ``State has already conducted the source selection \nand control measures analysis in such a manner that addresses the \nrequirements of 40 CFR 51.308(f)(ii).'' \\221\\ In its SIP, Texas \nprovided such an explanation and reiterated that its source selection \nmethodology resulted in the selection of 18 sources and for which the \nState considered various different potential controls, and the \nassociated costs and visibility improvement, before concluding that it \ndid not consider it reasonable to require additional control measures \nin its long-term strategy.\\222\\ Furthermore, as explained in more \ndetail in the discussion of Salt Creek in our discussion of 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2) in this document, recent visibility trends from the \nmonitor at Salt Creek, conservatism in Texas's modeling projections, \nplus more recent emission reductions that have occurred in New Mexico \nthat the modeling conducted did not include, demonstrate that \nvisibility condition in 2028 are likely to be below the URP. For these \nreasons, we are proposing that Texas met the applicable requirements of \n40 CFR 51.308(f)(3)(ii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\221\\ EPA Guidance on Regional Haze State Implementation Plans \nfor the Second Implementation Period, August 20, 2019, pg. 50.\n    \\222\\ 2021 Plan, at 7-14, 8-59 to 8-60.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nF. Reasonably Attributable Visibility Impairment (RAVI)\n\n    The RHR contains a requirement at 40 CFR 51.308(f)(4) related to \nany additional monitoring that may be needed to address visibility \nimpairment in Class I areas from a single source or a small group of \nsources. This is called ``reasonably attributable visibility \nimpairment,'' \\223\\ also known as RAVI. Under this provision, if the \nEPA or the FLM of an affected Class I area has advised a state that \nadditional monitoring is needed to assess RAVI, the state must include \nin its SIP revision for the second implementation period an appropriate \nstrategy for evaluating such impairment. The EPA has not advised Texas \nto that effect, and the FLMs for the Class I areas that Texas \ncontributes to have not identified any RAVI from Texas sources.\\224\\ \nFor this reason, the EPA proposes to approve the portions of Texas's \n2021 Plan relating to 40 CFR 51.308(f)(4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\223\\ The EPA's visibility protection regulations define \n``reasonably attributable visibility impairment'' as ``visibility \nimpairment that is caused by the emission of air pollutants from \none, or a small number of sources.'' 40 CFR 51.301.\n    \\224\\ 2021 Plan at 7-17.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22195]]\n\nG. Monitoring Strategy and Other Implementation Plan Requirements\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(6) specifies that each comprehensive revision of \na State's regional haze SIP must contain or provide for certain \nelements, including monitoring strategies, emissions inventories, and \nany reporting, recordkeeping and other measures needed to assess and \nreport on visibility. A main requirement of this subsection is for \nStates with Class I areas to submit monitoring strategies for \nmeasuring, characterizing, and reporting on visibility impairment. \nCompliance with this requirement may be met through participation in \nthe Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) \nnetwork.\n    Texas discusses its monitoring strategy in Chapter 5 of its 2021 \nRegional Haze Plan. Haze species in Texas are measured and analyzed via \nthe Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) \nnetwork.\\225\\ Table 21 of this preamble lists the IMPROVE stations \nrepresenting visibility at Texas Class I areas.

In its 2021 Plan, Texas stated that future \nassessments of visibility impairment and progress in reducing \nvisibility impairment at Texas's two Class I areas, and at Class I \nareas in other states that Texas's emissions may potentially affect, \nwill use the revised IMPROVE algorithm and will use data as prescribed \nin the EPA's Regional Haze Rule (40 CFR part 51, subpart P--Visibility \nProtection). The assessment will follow, as appropriate, the EPA's \nguidance including the 2019 Guidance and the 2018 Visibility Tracking \nGuidance.\n    Section 51.308(f)(6)(iii) does not apply to Texas, as it has a \nClass I area.\n    Section 51.308(f)(6)(iv) requires the SIP to provide for the \nreporting of all visibility monitoring data to the Administrator at \nleast annually for each Class I area in the state. As noted above, the \nmonitoring strategy for Texas relies upon the continued availability of \nthe IMPROVE network. The TCEQ does not directly collect or handle \nIMPROVE data. The TCEQ will continue to participate in the IMPROVE \nVisibility Information Exchange Web System (VIEWS). The TCEQ considers \nVIEWS to be a core part of the overall IMPROVE program. The TCEQ will \nreport IMPROVE data from the two Class I areas in Texas to the EPA \nusing the VIEWS web system.\n    If Texas collects any visibility monitoring data through the \nstate's air quality monitoring networks, the TCEQ will report those \ndata to the EPA as specified under the Performance Partnership Grant \nagreement negotiated with the EPA Region 6. All validated data and data \nanalysis results from any TCEQ visibility-related special studies are \npublic information. The TCEQ will continue its practice of sharing the \ndata and information with the EPA. Texas supports the continued \noperation of the IMPROVE network through both state and Federal funding \nmechanisms.\n    Section 51.308(f)(6)(v) requires SIPs to provide for a statewide \ninventory of emissions of pollutants that are reasonably anticipated to \ncause or contribute to visibility impairment, including emissions for \nthe most recent year for which data are available and estimates of \nfuture projected emissions. It also requires a commitment to update the \ninventory periodically. Texas provides for emissions inventories and \nestimates for future projected emissions by participating in the \nCenSARA RPO and complying with the EPA's Air Emissions Reporting Rule \n(AERR). In 40 CFR part 51, subpart A, the AERR requires states to \nsubmit updated emissions inventories for criteria pollutants to the \nEPA's Emissions Inventory System (EIS) every three years. The emission \ninventory data is used to develop the NEI, which provides for, among \nother things, a triennial state-wide inventory of pollutants that are \nreasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment.\n    Chapter 6 of the 2021 Plan includes a discussion of the NEI data, \nand Section 8.3 details specific emission inventories and emissions \ninputs developed for the regional haze photochemical modeling conducted \nby the TCEQ. The source categories of the emissions inventories \nincluded are: (1) point sources, (2) area sources, (3) non-road mobile \nsources, (4) drilling rigs, (5) commercial marine vessels and \nlocomotives, (6) airports and (7) on-road mobile sources. Statewide \npollutant summaries by source category for the years 2011, 2014, and \n2017 are provided in Tables 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3 of Texas's 2021 Plan. \nSummaries are for the following pollutants: SO<INF>2</INF>, \nNO<INF>X</INF>, PM<INF>10</INF>, PM<INF>2.5</INF>, VOCs, CO, and \nNH<INF>3</INF>. Texas also provided a summary of anthropogenic \nSO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions for each source type for \n2011, 2014, and 2017 and are presented in Tables 6-4 and 6-5 of the \n2021 Plan.\n\n[[Page 22196]]\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(6)(v) also requires states to include estimates \nof future projected emissions and include a commitment to update the \ninventory periodically. Texas estimated 2028 future year emissions by \napplying growth projections and accounting for known existing federal, \nstate, and local controls. The development of Texas's 2028 modeling \nemissions for the 2021 Plan includes some methods used in previous SIP \nmodeling for ozone, such as the Federal Tier 3 Vehicle Emission and \nFuel Standards program, the MECT Program in the Houston-Galveston-\nBrazoria area, the Highly Reactive VOC Emission Cap-and-Trade (HECT) \nProgram in Harris County, the Midlothian Cement Kiln caps and related \nagreed orders in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and the EPA's final Cross-\nState Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) update. Summaries of the primary data \nsources for the development of the future case modeling emissions are \nprovided in the 2021 Plan, appendix E, Table 1-4: Summary of Future \nCase Point Source Emission Data Sources, Table 1-5: Summary of Future \nCase On-Road Mobile Source Emission Data Sources, and Table 1-6: \nSummary of Future Case Non-Road Mobile, Off-Road, Area, Oil-and-Gas, \nand Biogenic Source Emission Data Sources. The gridded photochemical \nmodeling input files for the 2016 and 2028 emissions were provided \nalong with the full emission processing message log files during \nTexas's public comment period. For point sources, Texas evaluated large \nstationary sources of emissions, such as electric generating units \n(EGUs), smelters, industrial boilers, petroleum refineries, and \nmanufacturing facilities. Point source emissions were developed for the \nJanuary 1 through December 31, 2016, annual episode with a 2028 future \nyear projection. The data sources for development of the point source \nmodeling emissions are summarized in the 2021 Plan, appendix E, Table \n2-1: Sources of Point Source Emissions Data.\n    The EPA proposes to find that Texas has met the requirements of 40 \nCFR 51.308(f)(6) as described above, including its continued \nparticipation in the IMPROVE network and the CenSARA RPO and its on-\ngoing compliance with the AERR, and that no further elements are \nnecessary at this time for Texas to assess and report on visibility \npursuant to 40 CFR 51.308(f)(6)(vi).\n    In sum, for all the reasons discussed in this section, the EPA is \nproposing to approve Texas's 2021 Plan as meeting the requirements of \n40 CFR 51.308(f)(6).\n\nH. Requirements for Periodic Reports Describing Progress Towards the \nReasonable Progress Goals\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(5) requires that periodic comprehensive revisions \nof States' regional haze plans also address the progress report \nrequirements of 40 CFR 51.308(g)(1) through (5). The purpose of these \nrequirements is to evaluate progress towards the applicable RPGs for \neach Class I area within the State and each Class I area outside the \nState that may be affected by emissions from within that State. 40 CFR \n51.308(g)(1) and (2) apply to all States and require a description of \nthe status of implementation of all measures included in a State's \nfirst implementation period regional haze plan and a summary of the \nemission reductions achieved through implementation of those measures. \nSection 51.308(g)(3) applies only to States with Class I areas within \ntheir borders and requires such States to assess current visibility \nconditions, changes in visibility relative to baseline (2000-2004) \nvisibility conditions, and changes in visibility conditions relative to \nthe period addressed in the first implementation period progress \nreport. Section 51.308(g)(4) applies to all states and requires an \nanalysis tracking changes in emissions of pollutants contributing to \nvisibility impairment from all sources and sectors since the period \naddressed by the first implementation period progress report. This \nprovision further specifies the year or years through which the \nanalysis must extend depending on the type of source and the platform \nthrough which its emission information is reported. Finally, 40 CFR \n51.308(g)(5), which also applies to all states, requires an assessment \nof any significant changes in anthropogenic emissions within or outside \nthe state have occurred since the period addressed by the first \nimplementation period progress report, including whether such changes \nwere anticipated and whether they have limited or impeded expected \nprogress towards reducing emissions and improving visibility.\n    The 2021 Plan describes the status of measures of the long-term \nstrategy from the first implementation period to address the \nrequirements found in 40 CFR 51.308(g)(1) and (2). Control measures to \nreduce emission within and outside the State are found in the 2021 \nPlan, Chapter 7: Long-Term Strategy to Establish Reasonable Progress \nGoals, section 7.4: Federal Programs that Reduce Stationary Source \nEmissions, section 7.5: Federal Programs that Reduce Mobile Source \nEmissions, and section 7.6: State Air Pollution Control Programs. \nControl measures in the state are included in section 7.6: State Air \nPollution Control Programs, which discusses both State stationary and \nmobile source emissions control measures; section 7.6.2: Best Available \nControl Technology (BACT) Requirements, which discusses air permitting \nrequirements for new and modified sources of air pollution; and finally \nsection 7.6.3: Additional Measures, which discusses other measures \naddressing air pollution from mobile sources, construction activities, \nand fires, and measures addressing energy efficiency. Emissions \nreductions are found in the 2021 Plan, Chapter 6: Emissions Inventory, \nsection 6.8: NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> Emissions Trends, Table \n6-4: Anthropogenic NO<INF>X</INF> Emissions by Source Type, and Table \n6-5: Anthropogenic SO<INF>2</INF> Emissions by Source Type.\n    The EPA proposes to find that Texas has addressed the requirements \nof 40 CFR 51.308(g)(1) and (2) because the 2021 Plan describes the \nmeasures included in the long-term strategy from the first \nimplementation period, as well as the status of their implementation \nand the emission reductions achieved through such implementation.\n    Section 51.308(g)(3) requires that for each Class I area within the \nState, the State must assess the following visibility conditions and \nchanges, with values for most impaired, least impaired and/or clearest \ndays as applicable expressed in terms of five-year averages of these \nannual values. The 2021 Plan includes summaries of visibility \nconditions in Chapter 4: Assessment of Baseline and Current Conditions \nand Estimate of Natural Conditions in Class I Areas, section 4.2: \nBaseline Visibility Conditions, section 4.3: Natural Visibility \nConditions. Changes in visibility conditions are displayed in Chapter \n8: Reasonable Progress Goals, section 8.4: Reasonable Progress Goal \nStatus. The EPA therefore proposes to find that Texas has addressed the \nrequirements of 40 CFR 51.308(g)(3).\n    Pursuant to 40 CFR 51.308(g)(4), Texas evaluated emission trends \nfor reasonable progress for the 2021 Plan and presented those data in \nChapter 6: Emissions Inventory, section 6.7: Emissions Summaries, Table \n6-1: 2011 Statewide Pollutant Summary by Source Category, Table 6-2: \n2014 Statewide Pollutant Summary by Source Category, Table 6-3: 2017 \nStatewide Pollutant Summary by Source Category, Table 6-4: \nAnthropogenic NO<INF>X</INF> Emissions by Source Type, Table 6-5: \nAnthropogenic SO<INF>2</INF> Emissions by Source Type. The EPA is \nproposing to find that Texas has\n\n[[Page 22197]]\n\naddressed the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(g)(4) by providing \nemissions information for NO<INF>X</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, \nPM<INF>10</INF>, PM<INF>2.5</INF>, VOCs, and NH<INF>3</INF> broken down \nby type of source.\n    Texas identified reductions in anthropogenic emissions within and \noutside the State have occurred since the 2009 and 2014 Plans. This \ndiscussion can be found in Chapter 7 of its 2021 Plan. Texas uses the \nemissions trend data in the 2021 Plan \\227\\ to support the assessment \nthat anthropogenic haze-causing pollutant emissions in Texas have \ndecreased during the reporting period and that changes in emissions \nhave not limited or impeded progress in reducing pollutant emissions \nand improving visibility. Texas's 2017 emission inventories for \nNO<INF>X</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, PM<INF>10</INF>, PM<INF>2.5</INF>, \nVOCs, and NH<INF>3</INF> were lower than their 2014 emission \ninventories for those same pollutants emissions.\\228\\ The EPA is \nproposing to find that Texas has addressed the requirements of 40 CFR \n51.308(g)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\227\\ See 2021 Texas Regional Haze Plan, Section 6.8.\n    \\228\\ Trends in anthropogenic NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> \nemissions are presented in Figures 6-1 and 6-2 of the 2021 Plan, \nrespectively.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In sum, because Texas's 2021 Plan addresses the requirements of 40 \nCFR 51.308(g)(1) through (5) as required by 40 CFR 51.308(f)(5), the \nEPA is proposing to approve Texas's 2021 Plan as meeting the \nrequirements of 40 CFR 51.308(f)(5) for periodic progress reports.\n\nI. Requirements for State and Federal Land Manager Coordination\n\n    Section 169A(d) of the Clean Air Act requires States to consult \nwith FLMs before holding the public hearing on a proposed regional haze \nSIP, and to include a summary of the FLMs' conclusions and \nrecommendations in the notice to the public. In addition, 40 CFR \n51.308(i)(2)'s FLM consultation provision requires a State to provide \nFLMs with an opportunity for consultation that is early enough in the \nState's policy analyses of its emission reduction obligation so that \ninformation and recommendations provided by the FLMs' can meaningfully \ninform the State's decisions on its long-term strategy. If the \nconsultation has taken place at least 120 days before a public hearing \nor public comment period, the opportunity for consultation will be \ndeemed early enough. Regardless, the opportunity for consultation must \nbe provided at least sixty days before a public hearing or public \ncomment period at the State level. Section 51.308(i)(2) also provides \ntwo substantive topics on which FLMs must be provided an opportunity to \ndiscuss with States: assessment of visibility impairment in any Class I \narea and recommendations on the development and implementation of \nstrategies to address visibility impairment. Section 51.308(i)(3) \nrequires States, in developing their implementation plans, to include a \ndescription of how they addressed FLMs' comments. Section 51.308(i)(4) \nrequires States to provide procedures for continuing consultation \nbetween the State and the relevant FLM(s).\n    The EPA proposes to find, as required by CAA section 169A(d), that \nthe State consulted with the FLMs prior to holding a public hearing on \nits proposed haze plan, and that the State also provided the FLMs' \nconclusions and recommendations to the public during the comment \nperiod. The TCEQ consulted with the FLMs about the impact of Texas's \nemissions on regional haze at the regional Class I areas through \nconference calls. The TCEQ gave a presentation in March 2020 and \ndiscussed impacts to Class I areas in the region. An additional meeting \nwas held October 8, 2020. The TCEQ included information from the \nconsultation with the FLMs in appendix A of the 2021 Plan. Notices of \nthe proposed SIP, availability and the public hearing were published on \nthe TCEQ's website and in the Texas Register, the Fort Worth Star \nTelegram, the Houston Chronicle, the Austin American-Statesman, and the \nEl Paso Times. A virtual public hearing on the proposed SIP revision \nwas held on December 8, 2020, and was available for participation via \ninternet or phone. Written comments relevant to the proposal were \naccepted until the close of business January 8, 2021.\n    The State also satisfied the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(i). As \nrequired by 40 CFR 51.308(i)(2), the TCEQ provided the FLMs with the \nopportunity to consult. In accordance with 40 CFR 51.308(i)(3), the \nTCEQ also responded to the FLMs' comments in appendix A of the 2021 \nPlan as well as its Response to Comments document. Finally, Section \n3.4.6 of the 2021 Plan describes how the TCEQ will meet the \nrequirements of 40 CFR 51.308(i)(4) regarding procedures for continuing \nconsultation. Therefore, the EPA proposes to approve the FLM \nconsultation component of the 2021 Plan.\n\nJ. Proposed Action\n\n    For the reasons set forth in section VII of this rulemaking, the \nEPA is proposing to approve Texas's 2021 Plan as satisfying the \nregional haze requirements for the second planning period contained in \n40 CFR 51.308(f), (i).\n\nVII. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\n\n    Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP \nsubmission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable \nFederal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in \nreviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve State choices, \nprovided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this \naction merely proposes to approve State law as meeting Federal \nrequirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those \nimposed by State law. For that reason, this action:\n\n    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to \nreview by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order \n12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);\n    <bullet> Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) \ndoes not apply because SIP actions are exempt from review under \nExecutive Order 12866;\n    <bullet> Does not impose an information collection burden under \nthe provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et \nseq.);\n    <bullet> Is certified as not having a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);\n    <bullet> Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly \nor uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);\n    <bullet> Does not have federalism implications as specified in \nExecutive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);\n    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, \nApril 23, 1997) because it approves a State program;\n    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to \nExecutive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and\n    <bullet> Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the \nNational Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. \n272 note) because application of those requirements would be \ninconsistent with the Clean Air Act.\n\nExecutive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    This proposed approval of the portion of the Oklahoma regional haze \nSIP that addressed the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1)(i) through \n(v) will apply, if finalized as proposed, to certain areas of Indian \ncountry throughout Oklahoma as discussed in the preamble, and therefore \nhas tribal implications as specified in E.O. 13175 (65 FR 67249, \nNovember 9, 2000). However, this action will neither impose substantial \ndirect compliance costs on federally recognized tribal\n\n[[Page 22198]]\n\ngovernments, nor preempt tribal law. This action will not impose \nsubstantial direct compliance costs on federally recognized tribal \ngovernments because no actions will be required of tribal governments. \nThis action will also not preempt tribal law as no Oklahoma tribe \nimplements a regulatory program under the CAA, and thus does not have \napplicable or related tribal laws. Consistent with the EPA Policy on \nConsultation with Indian Tribes (December 7, 2023), the EPA will offer \nconsultation to tribal governments that may be affected by this action \nand provided information about this action.\n    In addition, the Texas SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian \nreservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian Tribe \nhas demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of \nIndian country in Texas, the proposed rule does not have Tribal \nimplications and will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal \ngovernments or preempt Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 \n(65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).\n\nList of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52\n\n    Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Incorporation by \nreference, Intergovernmental relations, Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone, \nParticulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur \noxides.\n    Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.\n\n    Dated: May 14, 2025.\nWalter Mason,\nRegional Administrator Region 6.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09293 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6560-50-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

The Boeing Model 777-9 airplane, which is a derivative of the \nBoeing Model 777 airplane currently approved under Type Certificate No. \nT00001SE, is a twin-engine, transport category airplane with seating \nfor 495 passengers, and a maximum takeoff weight of 775,000 lbs.\n    On September 29, 2021, special conditions (No. 25-791-SC) were \nissued for this design feature and became effective on October 4, 2021 \n(86 FR 54588, Oct. 4, 2021).\n\nType Certification Basis\n\n    Under the provisions of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 \nCFR) 21.101, Boeing must show that the Model 777-9 series airplane \nmeets the applicable provisions of the regulations listed in Type \nCertificate No. T00001SE, or the applicable regulations in effect on \nthe date of application for the change, except for earlier amendments \nas agreed upon by the FAA.\n    If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness \nregulations (e.g., 14 CFR part 25) do not contain adequate or \nappropriate safety standards for the Boeing Model 777-9 series airplane \nbecause of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are \nprescribed under the provisions of Sec.  21.16.\n    Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which \nthey are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended \nlater to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or \nunusual design feature, or should any other model already included on \nthe same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or \nunusual design feature, these special conditions would also apply to \nthe other model under Sec.  21.101.\n    In addition to the applicable airworthiness regulations and special \nconditions, the Boeing Model 777-9 series airplane must comply with the \nfuel vent and exhaust emission requirements of 14 CFR part 34 and the \nnoise-certification requirements of 14 CFR part 36.\n    The FAA issues special conditions, as defined in 14 CFR 11.19, in \naccordance with Sec.  11.38, and they become part of the type \ncertification basis under Sec.  21.101.\n\nNovel or Unusual Design Features\n\n    The Boeing Model 777-9 series airplane will incorporate the \nfollowing novel or unusual design feature:\n    Electrical and electronic systems that perform critical functions, \nthe loss of which may result in loss of flight controls and other \ncritical systems and may be catastrophic to the airplane.\n\nDiscussion\n\n    The Boeing Model 777-9 series airplane has a fly-by-wire flight \ncontrol system that requires a continuous source of electrical power in \norder to maintain an operable flight control system. Section \n25.1351(d), ``Operation without normal electrical power,'' requires \nsafe operation in visual flight rule (VFR) conditions for at least 5 \nminutes after the loss of normal electrical power excluding the \nbattery. This rule is structured around a traditional design using \nmechanical control cables and linkages for flight control. These manual \ncontrols allow the crew to maintain aerodynamic control of the airplane \nfor an indefinite period of time after loss of all electrical power. \nUnder these conditions, a mechanical flight control system provides the \ncrew with the ability to fly the airplane while attempting to identify \nthe cause of the electrical failure, restart engine(s) if necessary, \nand attempt to re-establish some of the electrical power generation \ncapability.\n    A critical assumption in Sec.  25.1351(d) is that the airplane is \nin VFR conditions at the time of the failure. This is not a valid \nassumption in today's airline operating environment where airplanes fly \nmuch of the time in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) on air \ntraffic control defined flight paths. Another assumption in the \nexisting rule is that the loss of all normal electrical power is the \nresult of the loss of all engines. The 5-minute period in the rule is \nto allow at least one engine to be restarted following an all-engine \npower loss in order to continue the flight to a safe landing. However, \nservice experience on airplane models with similar electrical power \nsystem architecture as the Boeing Model 777-9 airplane has shown that \nat least the temporary loss of all electrical power for causes other \nthan all-engine failure is not extremely improbable.\n    To maintain the same level of safety envisioned by the existing \nrule with\n\n[[Page 22006]]\n\ntraditional mechanical flight controls, the Boeing Model 777-9 series \nairplane design must not be time-limited in its operation under all \nreasonably foreseeable conditions, including loss of all normal sources \nof engine or auxiliary power unit (APU)-generated electrical power. \nUnless Boeing can show that the non-restorable loss of the engine and \nAPU power sources is extremely improbable, Boeing must demonstrate that \nthe airplanes can maintain safe flight and landing (including steering \nand braking on the ground for airplanes using steer/brake-by-wire and/\nor fly-by-wire speed brake panels) with the use of its emergency/\nalternate electrical power systems. These electrical power systems, or \nthe minimum restorable electrical power sources, must be able to power \nloads that are essential for continued safe flight and landing, \nincluding those required for the maximum length of approved flight \ndiversion.\n    The FAA is amending two paragraphs from the original special \nconditions. Those paragraphs are (d)(2) and (e)(4). Paragraph (d)(2) of \nthe original special conditions states that the operating limitations \nsection of the airplane flight manual (AFM) must incorporate non-normal \nprocedures that direct the pilot to take appropriate actions to \nactivate the APU after loss of normal engine-driven generated \nelectrical power. The FAA is requiring that these non-normal procedures \nbe incorporated in the AFM instead of requiring them to be in the \noperating limitations section of the AFM.\n    Paragraph (e)(4) of the original special conditions states that the \nairplane must provide adequate indication of loss of normal electrical \npower to direct the pilot to the non-normal procedures, and the \noperating limitations section of the AFM must incorporate non-normal \nprocedures that will direct the pilot to take appropriate actions. As \nin paragraph (d)(2), the FAA is requiring that these non-normal \nprocedures be incorporated in the AFM instead of specifying the \nparticular section of the AFM that these procedures need to reside.\n    These are to remedy an oversight that occurred during the issuance \nof the original special conditions where the FAA inadvertently required \nthe non-normal procedures to be in the limitations section of the AFM. \nThe FAA found that this requirement is inconsistent with similarly \nissued special conditions for other transport category airplanes. The \nBoeing 777-9 electrical power system does not require pilot activation \nof the APU after loss of normal engine-driven generated electrical \npower. Paragraph (d) does not apply to designs that do not rely on the \nAPU for an alternate source of power. The intent of paragraphs (d)(2) \nand (e)(4) is to ensure that non-normal procedures that provide \ninstructions to the pilot to take appropriate action are incorporated \ninto the AFM. These procedures are more appropriate for the operating \nprocedures section of the AFM and were not intended to be an operating \nlimitation.\n    The special conditions contain the additional safety standards that \nthe Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety \nequivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.\n\nDiscussion of Comments\n\n    To provide the public with an opportunity to comment on this \namendment, the FAA issued Notice of Proposed Special Conditions No. 25-\n791-SC for the Boeing Company Model 777-9 series airplane, which was \npublished in the Federal Register on August 2, 2024 (89 FR 63111).\n    The FAA received responses from two commenters.\n    An individual requested that the FAA not issue this amendment, \nstating that the company should not receive special treatment. The \nFAA's special conditions process is established by regulation and is \navailable to all applicants. FAA made no change as a result of this \ncomment.\n    The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) commented that after \nreviewing the FAA's proposal to change two paragraphs of this special \ncondition, ALPA does not support design features which increase the \npsychological and workload burden on flightcrew to recover the supply \nof the electrical generation and distribution system to the aircraft \nthrough manual activation of the APU, in addition to the required \nmultiple start attempt to the engines.\n    The FAA does not agree that the special conditions, as now amended, \nrequire design features that would increase the psychological and \nworkload burden on the flightcrew in order to recover the supply \nelectrical generation and distribution system to the aircraft. Special \nconditions are issued by the FAA when a proposed aircraft, aircraft \nengine, or propeller incorporates a design feature that is novel or \nunusual, i.e., it was not envisaged by the existing design regulations. \nAircraft were originally designed using mechanical cables and linkages \nto control flight surfaces. Modern aircraft use fly-by-wire designs to \nincorporate enhanced flight envelope protections to increase safety \nover the earlier mechanical flight control designs. The FAA's \ngenerally-applicable design standard for operation of transport \nairplanes that lack electrical power, 14 CFR 25.1351, envisaged \nmechanical flight control systems, therefore the FAA issues special \nconditions to address modern fly-by-wire aircraft designs.\n    Boeing 777-9 Special Conditions No. 25-791-SC, as originally \nissued, includes procedures for pilot manual activation of the APU \nafter loss of normal engine-driven generated electrical power. This \nprocedure is performed by the pilot, while the flight controls are \noperating on battery power to ensure APU electrical power is available \nfor the flight controls until engine-driven electrical power is \nrestored. Therefore, these revised special conditions do not change the \nflightcrew burden but instead remove the prior requirement that the \nprocedure be in the Limitations section of the airplane flight manual \n(AFM). Activation of the APU after loss of normal engine-driven \ngenerated electrical power is a non-normal pilot procedure, which is \nproperly in the procedures rather than limitations section. Therefore, \nthis amendment only changes the location in the AFM for this procedure \nfrom the Limitations section to the Non-Normal section and removes the \nrequirement for the procedure to be in the Limitation section.\n    The FAA has also restored the statement that these special \nconditions are in lieu of 14 CFR 25.1351(d); this statement was \ninadvertently left out of the notice but was part of the original \nspecial conditions.\n    The special conditions are adopted as proposed with the edit as \nmentioned above.\n\nApplicability\n\n    As discussed above, these special conditions, as amended, are \napplicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type \ncertificate for that model be amended later to include any other model \nthat incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature, or should \nany other model already included on the same type certificate be \nmodified to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, these \nspecial conditions would apply to the other model as well.\n\nConclusion\n\n    This action affects only a certain novel or unusual design feature \non one model series of airplane. It is not a rule of general \napplicability.\n\n[[Page 22007]]\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25\n\n    Aircraft, Aviation safety, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements.\n\nAuthority Citation\n\n    The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows:\n\n    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 106(g), 40113, 44701, 44702, 44704.\n\nThe Special Conditions\n\n    Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issues the \nfollowing special conditions, as amended, as part of the type \ncertification basis for The Boeing Company Model 777-9 series \nairplanes.\n    In lieu of 14 CFR 25.1351(d), the following special conditions \napply:\n    (a) The applicant must show by test or a combination of test and \nanalysis that the airplane is capable of continued safe flight and \nlanding with all normal electrical power sources inoperative, as \nprescribed by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), below. For purposes of \nthese special conditions, normal sources of electrical power generation \ndo not include any alternate power sources such as the battery, ram air \nturbine, or independent power systems such as the flight control \npermanent magnet generating system. In showing capability for continued \nsafe flight and landing, the applicant must account for systems \ncapability, effects on crew workload and operating conditions, and the \nphysiological needs of the flightcrew and passengers for the longest \ndiversion time for which the applicant is seeking approval.\n    (1) In showing compliance with this requirement, the applicant must \naccount for common-cause failures, cascading failures, and zonal \nphysical threats.\n    (2) The applicant may consider the ability to restore operation of \nportions of the electrical power generation and distribution system if \nit can be shown that unrecoverable loss of those portions of the system \nis extremely improbable. The design must provide an alternative source \nof electrical power for the time required to restore the minimum \nelectrical power generation capability required for safe flight and \nlanding. The applicant may exclude unrecoverable loss of all engines \nwhen showing compliance with this requirement.\n    (b) Regardless of any electrical generation and distribution system \nrecovery capability shown under paragraph (a) of these special \nconditions, sufficient electrical system capability must be provided \nto:\n    (1) Allow time to descend, with all engines inoperative, at the \nspeed that provides the best glide distance, from the maximum operating \naltitude to the top of the engine restart envelope; and\n    (2) Subsequently allow multiple start attempts of the engines and \nauxiliary power unit (APU). The design must provide this capability in \naddition to the electrical capability required by existing part 25 \nrequirements related to operation with all engines inoperative.\n    (c) The airplane emergency electrical power system must be designed \nto supply:\n    (1) Electrical power required for immediate safety, which must \ncontinue to operate without the need for crew action following the loss \nof the normal electrical power, for a duration sufficient to allow \nreconfiguration to provide a non-time-limited source of electrical \npower.\n    (2) Electrical power required for continued safe flight and landing \nfor the maximum diversion time.\n    (d) If the applicant uses APU-generated electrical power to satisfy \nthe requirements of these special conditions, and if reaching a \nsuitable runway for landing is beyond the capacity of the battery \nsystems, then the APU must be able to be started under any foreseeable \nflight condition prior to the depletion of the battery or the \nrestoration of normal electrical power, whichever occurs first. Flight \ntest must demonstrate this capability at the most critical condition.\n    (1) The applicant must show that the APU will provide adequate \nelectrical power for continued safe flight and landing.\n    (2) The airplane flight manual (AFM) must incorporate non-normal \nprocedures that direct the pilot to take appropriate actions to \nactivate the APU after loss of normal engine-driven generated \nelectrical power.\n    (e) As part of showing compliance with these special conditions, \nthe tests to demonstrate loss of all normal electrical power must also \ntake into account the following:\n    (1) The assumption that the failure condition occurs during night \ninstrument meteorological conditions (IMC) at the most critical phase \nof the flight, relative to the worst possible electrical power \ndistribution and equipment-loads-demand condition.\n    (2) After the un-restorable loss of normal engine generator power, \nthe airplane engine restart capability is provided, and operations \ncontinued in IMC.\n    (3) The airplane is demonstrated to be capable of continued safe \nflight and landing. The length of time must be computed based on the \nmaximum diversion time capability for which the airplane is being \ncertified. The applicant must account for airspeed reductions resulting \nfrom the associated failure or failures.\n    (4) The airplane must provide adequate indication of loss of normal \nelectrical power to direct the pilot to the non-normal procedures, and \nthe AFM must incorporate non-normal procedures that will direct the \npilot to take appropriate actions.\n\n    Issued in in Kansas City, Missouri, on May 20, 2025.\nPatrick R.

Wolf, Manager, Flight \nProcedures and Airspace Group, Flight Technologies and Procedures \nDivision, Office of Safety Standards, Flight Standards Service, \nAviation Safety, Federal Aviation Administration. Mailing Address: FAA \nMike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Flight Procedures and Airspace \nGroup, 6500 South MacArthur Blvd., STB Annex, Bldg. 26, Room 217, \nOklahoma City, OK 73099. Telephone (405) 954-1139.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule amends 14 CFR part 97 by \nestablishing, amending, suspending, or removes SIAPS, Takeoff Minimums \nand/or ODPS. The complete regulatory description of each SIAP and its \nassociated Takeoff Minimums or ODP for an identified airport is listed \non FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this \namendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and 14 CFR 97.20. The \napplicable FAA Forms are 8260-3, 8260-4, 8260-5, 8260-15A, 8260-15B, \nwhen required by an entry on 8260-15A, and 8260-15C.\n    The large number of SIAPs, Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, their complex \nnature, and the need for a special format make publication in the \nFederal Register expensive and impractical. Further, pilots do not use \nthe regulatory text of the SIAPs, Takeoff Minimums or ODPs, but instead \nrefer to their graphic depiction on charts printed by publishers of \naeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by \nreference are realized and publication of the complete description of \neach SIAP, Takeoff Minimums and ODP listed on FAA form documents is \nunnecessary. This amendment provides the affected CFR sections and \nspecifies the types of SIAPS, Takeoff Minimums and ODPs with their \napplicable effective dates. This amendment also identifies the airport \nand its location, the procedure, and the amendment number.\n\nAvailability and Summary of Material Incorporated by Reference\n\n    The material incorporated by reference is publicly available as \nlisted in the ADDRESSES section.\n    The material incorporated by reference describes SIAPS, Takeoff \nMinimums and/or ODPs as identified in the amendatory language for part \n97 of this final rule.\n\nThe Rule\n\n    This amendment to 14 CFR part 97 is effective upon publication of \neach separate SIAP, Takeoff Minimums and ODP as amended in the \ntransmittal. Some SIAP and Takeoff Minimums and textual ODP amendments \nmay have been issued previously by the FAA in a Flight Data Center \n(FDC) Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) as an emergency action of \nimmediate flights safety relating directly to published aeronautical \ncharts.\n    The circumstances that created the need for some SIAP and Takeoff \nMinimums and ODP amendments may require making them effective in less \nthan 30 days. For the remaining SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, an \neffective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.\n    Further, the SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums and ODPs contained in this \namendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for \nTerminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs and \nTakeoff Minimums and ODPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the \nconditions existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of \nthe close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs, Takeoff \nMinimums and ODPs, and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and \npublic procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary \nto the public interest and, where applicable, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), \ngood cause exists for making some SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.\n    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an \nestablished body of technical regulations for which frequent and \nroutine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. \nIt, therefore--(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under \nExecutive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT \nRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); \nand (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the \nanticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA \ncertifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nLists of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 97\n\n    Air traffic control, Airports, Incorporation by reference, \nNavigation (air).\n\n    Issued in Washington, DC, on May 9, 2025.\nRomana B. Wolf,\nManager, Flight Procedures and Airspace Group, Flight Technologies and \nProcedures Division, Office of Safety Standards, Flight Standards \nService, Aviation Safety, Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nAdoption of the Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, 14 CFR part \n97 is amended by establishing, amending, suspending, or removing \nStandard Instrument Approach Procedures and/or Takeoff Minimums and \nObstacle Departure Procedures effective at 0901 UTC on the dates \nspecified, as follows:\n\nPART 97--STANDARD INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURES\n\n0\n1.

No. 4166]\n\n\nStandard Instrument Approach Procedures, and Takeoff Minimums and \nObstacle Departure Procedures; Miscellaneous Amendments\n\nAGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.\n\nACTION: Final rule.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSUMMARY: This rule amends, suspends, or removes Standard Instrument \nApproach Procedures (SIAPs) and associated Takeoff Minimums and \nObstacle Departure Procedures for operations at certain airports. These \nregulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised \ncriteria, or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace \nSystem, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, \nadding new obstacles, or changing air traffic requirements. These \nchanges are designed to provide for the safe and efficient use of the \nnavigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under \ninstrument flight rules at the affected airports.\n\nDATES: This rule is effective May 23, 2025. The compliance date for \neach SIAP, associated Takeoff Minimums, and ODP is specified in the \namendatory provisions.\n    The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in \nthe regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as \nof May 23, 2025.\n\nADDRESSES: Availability of matter incorporated by reference in the \namendment is as follows:\n\nFor Examination\n\n    1. U.S. Department of Transportation, Docket Ops--M30, 1200 New \nJersey Avenue SE, West Bldg., Ground Floor, Washington, DC 20590-0001;\n    2. The FAA Air Traffic Organization Service Area in which the \naffected airport is located;\n    3. The office of Aeronautical Information Services, 6500 South \nMacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK 73169 or,\n    4. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).\n    For information on the availability of this material at NARA, visit \n<a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/cfr/ibr-locations\">www.archives.gov/federal-register/cfr/ibr-locations</a> or email \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f79185d99e9984879294839e9899b799968596d9909881\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f69084d89f9885869395829f9998b698978497d8919980\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.\n\nAvailability\n\n    All SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums and ODPs are available online free \nof charge. Visit the National Flight Data Center online at <a href=\"http://nfdc.faa.gov\">nfdc.faa.gov</a> \nto register. Additionally, individual SIAP and Takeoff Minimums and ODP \ncopies may be obtained from the FAA Air Traffic Organization Service \nArea in which the affected airport is located.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Romana B. Wolf, Manager, Flight \nProcedures and Airspace Group, Flight Technologies and Procedures \nDivision, Office of Safety Standards, Flight Standards Service, \nAviation Safety, Federal Aviation Administration. Mailing Address: FAA \nMike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Flight Procedures and Airspace \nGroup, 6500 South MacArthur Blvd., STB Annex, Bldg. 26, Room 217, \nOklahoma City, OK 73099. Telephone (405) 954-1139.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule amends 14 CFR part 97 by amending \nthe referenced SIAPs. The complete regulatory description of each SIAP \nis listed on the appropriate FAA Form 8260, as modified by the National \nFlight Data Center (NFDC)/Permanent Notice to Air Missions (P-NOTAM), \nand is incorporated by reference under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, \nand 14 CFR 97.20. The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and \nthe need for a special format make their verbatim publication in the \nFederal Register expensive and impractical. Further, pilots do not use \nthe regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic depiction \non charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the \nadvantages of incorporation by reference are realized and publication \nof the complete description of each SIAP contained on FAA form \ndocuments is unnecessary. This amendment provides the affected CFR \nsections, and specifies the SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums and ODPs with \ntheir applicable effective dates. This amendment also identifies the \nairport and its location, the procedure and the amendment number.\n\nAvailability and Summary of Material Incorporated by Reference\n\n    The material incorporated by reference is publicly available as \nlisted in the ADDRESSES section.\n\n[[Page 22011]]\n\n    The material incorporated by reference describes SIAPs, Takeoff \nMinimums and ODPs as identified in the amendatory language for part 97 \nof this final rule.\n\nThe Rule\n\n    This amendment to 14 CFR part 97 is effective upon publication of \neach separate SIAP and Takeoff Minimums and ODP as amended in the \ntransmittal. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this \namendment incorporates only specific changes contained for each SIAP \nand Takeoff Minimums and ODP as modified by FDC permanent NOTAMs.\n    The SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, as modified by FDC \npermanent NOTAM, and contained in this amendment are based on criteria \ncontained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures \n(TERPS). In developing these changes to SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums and \nODPs, the TERPS criteria were applied only to specific conditions \nexisting at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments in this rule \nhave been previously issued by the FAA in a FDC NOTAM as an emergency \naction of immediate flight safety relating directly to published \naeronautical charts.\n    The circumstances that created the need for these SIAP and Takeoff \nMinimums and ODP amendments require making them effective in less than \n30 days.\n    Because of the close and immediate relationship between these \nSIAPs, Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, and safety in air commerce, I find \nthat notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest and, where \napplicable, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), good cause exists for making these \nSIAPs effective in less than 30 days.\n    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an \nestablished body of technical regulations for which frequent and \nroutine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. \nIt, therefore--(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under \nExecutive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT \nregulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); \nand (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the \nanticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA \ncertifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 97\n\n    Air traffic control, Airports, Incorporation by reference, \nNavigation (air).\n\n    Issued in Washington, DC, on May 9, 2025.\nRomana B. Wolf,\nManager, Flight Procedures and Airspace Group, Flight Technologies and \nProcedures Division, Office of Safety Standards, Flight Standards \nService, Aviation Safety, Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nAdoption of the Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, 14 CFR part \n97 is amended by amending Standard Instrument Approach Procedures and \nTakeoff Minimums and ODPs, effective at 0901 UTC on the dates \nspecified, as follows:\n\nPART 97--STANDARD INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 97 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 106(g), 40103, 40106, 40113, 40114, \n40120, 44502, 44514, 44701, 44719, 44721-44722.\n\n\n0\n2.

These changes were outlined in an April 2, 2024 application \nto the EPA. We have determined that these changes satisfy all \nrequirements needed for final authorization.\n\nDATES: This authorization is effective on July 22, 2025 without further \nnotice unless the EPA receives adverse comment by June 23, 2025. If the \nEPA receives adverse comment, we will either publish a timely \nwithdrawal of this direct final action in the Federal Register \ninforming the public that the authorization will not take effect, or we \nwill publish a notification containing a response to comments that \neither reverses the decision or affirms that the final action will take \neffect.

Why is the EPA using a direct final action?\n\n    The EPA is publishing this action without a prior proposed rule \nbecause we view this as a noncontroversial action and anticipate no \nadverse comment. This action is a routine program change. However, in \nthe ``Proposed Rules'' section of this issue of the Federal Register, \nwe are publishing a separate document that will serve as the proposed \nrule allowing the public an opportunity to comment. We will not \ninstitute a second comment period on this action. Any parties \ninterested in commenting must do so at this time. For further \ninformation about commenting on this action, see the ADDRESSES section \nof this document.\n    If the EPA receives adverse comments, we will either withdraw this \naction by publishing a document in the Federal Register before the \naction becomes effective, or we will publish a notification containing \na response to comments that either reverses the decision or affirms \nthat the final action will take effect. In the event that the final \naction is withdrawn, the EPA would base any further decision on the \nauthorization of the State's program changes on the proposal mentioned \nin the previous paragraph and after consideration of all comments \nreceived during the comment period. We would address all public \ncomments and make a final decision on authorization in a subsequent \nfinal action.\n\nII. Why are revisions to state programs necessary?\n\n    States that have received final authorization from the EPA under \nRCRA section 3006(b), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), must maintain a hazardous \nwaste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less \nstringent than the Federal program. As the Federal program changes, \nStates must change their programs and ask the EPA to authorize the \nchanges. Changes to State programs may be necessary when Federal or \nState statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain \nother changes occur. Most commonly, States must\n\n[[Page 22014]]\n\nchange their programs because of changes to the EPA's regulations in \nTitle 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 124, 260 \nthrough 268, 270, 273, and 279.\n    New Federal requirements and prohibitions imposed by Federal \nregulations that the EPA promulgates pursuant to the Hazardous and \nSolid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) take effect in authorized States \nat the same time they take effect in unauthorized States. Thus, the EPA \nshall have the authority to implement those requirements and \nprohibitions in Mississippi, including the issuance of new permits \nimplementing those requirements, until the State is granted \nauthorization to do so.\n\nIII. What decisions has the EPA made in this action?\n\n    Mississippi submitted a complete program revision application \n(PRA), dated April 2, 2024, seeking authorization of changes to its \nhazardous waste program corresponding to certain Federal rules \npromulgated between July 1, 2014 and June 30, 2021 (including RCRA \nCluster \\1\\ XXIV (Checklists \\2\\ 233 (A, B, C, D2, E) and 234), RCRA \nCluster XXV (Checklists 236 and 237), RCRA Cluster XXVI (Checklists 238 \nand 239), RCRA Cluster XXVII (Checklists 240 and 241), RCRA Cluster \nXXVIII (Checklist 242), and RCRA Cluster XXIX (Checklist 243). The EPA \nconcludes that Mississippi's application to revise its authorized \nprogram meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements \nestablished under RCRA, as set forth in RCRA section 3006(b), 42 U.S.C. \n6926(b), and 40 CFR part 271. Therefore, the EPA grants Mississippi \nfinal authorization to operate its hazardous waste program with the \nchanges described in the PRA, and as outlined below in section VI of \nthis document.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ A ``cluster'' is a grouping of hazardous waste rules that \nthe EPA promulgates from July 1st of one year to June 30th of the \nfollowing year.\n    \\2\\ A ``checklist'' is developed by the EPA for each Federal \nrule amending the RCRA regulations. The checklists document the \nchanges made by each Federal rule and are presented and numbered in \nchronological order by date of promulgation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Mississippi has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, \nand disposal facilities within its borders (except in Indian country, \nas defined at 18 U.S.C. 1151) and for carrying out the aspects of the \nRCRA program described in its PRA, subject to the limitations of HSWA, \nas discussed above.\n\nIV. What is the effect of this authorization decision?\n\n    The effect of this decision is that the changes described in \nMississippi's PRA as outlined below and in section VI of this document \nwill become part of the authorized State hazardous waste program and \nwill therefore be federally enforceable. Mississippi will continue to \nhave primary enforcement authority and responsibility for its State \nhazardous waste program. The EPA will maintain its authorities under \nRCRA sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003, including its authority to:\n    <bullet> Conduct inspections, and require monitoring, tests, \nanalyses, and reports;\n    <bullet> Enforce RCRA requirements, including authorized State \nprogram requirements, and suspend or revoke permits; and\n    <bullet> Take enforcement actions regardless of whether the State \nhas taken its own actions.\n    This action does not impose additional requirements on the \nregulated community because the regulations for which the EPA is \nauthorizing Mississippi are already effective under State law and are \nnot changed by this action.\n\nV. What has Mississippi previously been authorized for?\n\n    Mississippi initially received final authorization on June 13, \n1984, effective June 27, 1984 (49 FR 24377), to implement the RCRA \nhazardous waste management program. The EPA granted authorization for \nchanges to Mississippi's program on August 17, 1988, effective October \n17, 1988 (53 FR 31000); August 10, 1990, effective October 9, 1990 (55 \nFR 32624); March 29, 1991, effective May 28, 1991 (56 FR 13079); June \n26, 1991, effective August 27, 1991 (56 FR 29589); May 11, 1992, \neffective July 10, 1992 (57 FR 20056); April 8, 1993, effective June 7, \n1993 (58 FR 18162); October 20, 1993, effective December 20, 1993 (58 \nFR 54044); March 18, 1994, effective May 17, 1994 (59 FR 12857); June \n1, 1995, effective July 31, 1995 (60 FR 28539); August 30, 1995, \neffective October 30, 1995 (60 FR 5718); February 23, 2005, effective \nApril 25, 2005 (70 FR 8731); August 4, 2008, effective October 3, 2008 \n(73 FR 45170); and April 3, 2019, effective April 3, 2019 (84 FR \n12936).\n\nVI. What changes is the EPA authorizing with this action?\n\n    Mississippi submitted a complete PRA, dated April 2, 2024, seeking \nauthorization of changes to its hazardous waste management program in \naccordance with 40 CFR 271.21. This application included changes \nassociated with Checklists 233, 234, and 236 through 243 from RCRA \nClusters XXIV through XXIX. The EPA has determined, subject to receipt \nof written comments that oppose this action, that Mississippi's \nhazardous waste program revisions are equivalent to, consistent with, \nand no less stringent than the Federal program, and therefore satisfy \nall of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. \nTherefore, the EPA grants final authorization to Mississippi for the \nfollowing program changes:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                      Analogous state authority\n    Description of Federal requirement          Federal Register date and page                   \\1\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChecklist 219 (2008) \\2\\, Revisions to     73 FR 64668 10/20/2008, 80 FR 1694 1/13/  R. 1.1, 1.2, and 1.16.\n the Definition of Solid Waste (DSW), as    2015, 83 FR 24664 5/30/2018.\n amended by Checklist 233 (2015 and\n 2018).

Where are the revised State rules different than the Federal \nrules?\n\n    When revised State rules differ from the Federal rules in the RCRA \nState authorization process, the EPA determines whether the State rules \nare equivalent to, more stringent than, or broader in scope than the \nFederal program. Pursuant to RCRA section 3009, 42 U.S.C. 6929, State \nprograms may contain requirements that are more stringent than the \nFederal regulations. Such more stringent requirements can be federally \nauthorized and, once authorized, become federally enforceable. Although \nthe statute does not prevent States from adopting regulations that are \nbroader in scope than the Federal program, States cannot receive \nFederal authorization for such regulations, and they are not federally \nenforceable. There are no State requirements in the program revisions \nlisted in the table above that are considered to be broader in scope \nthan the Federal requirements. The EPA has determined that certain \nregulations included in Mississippi's program revisions listed in the \ntable above are more stringent than the Federal program. These more \nstringent requirements will become part of the federally enforceable \nRCRA program in Mississippi when authorized.\n    Mississippi's program at 11 Miss. Admin. Code Pt. 3, Ch. 1, R.1.3, \n1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 1.12, is more stringent than the Federal Program at \n40 CFR 262.18(d), 262.41(a), 264.75, and 265.75. The Mississippi \nprovisions require annual reporting where the Federal provisions \nrequire biennial or quadrennial reporting or notification.\n    There are certain regulatory provisions for which the States cannot \nbe authorized to administer or implement. These provisions include the \nrequirements associated with the operation of the national E-Manifest \nsystem and its user fee provisions contained in the Hazardous Waste \nElectronic Manifest User Fee Rule (Checklist 239). Although Mississippi \nhas adopted these regulations to maintain its equivalency with the \nFederal program, it has appropriately maintained the Federal \nreferences. See 11 Miss. Admin. Code Pt. 3, Ch. 1, R. 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, \n1.7, and 1.11.\n    Because of the Federal Government's special role in matters of \nforeign policy, the EPA does not authorize States to administer the \nFederal import/export functions associated with the Revisions to the \nDefinition of Solid Waste (Checklist 233D2), Imports and Exports of \nHazardous Waste Rule (Checklist 236), and the Confidentiality \nDeterminations for Hazardous Waste Export and Import Documents Rule \n(Checklist 238). Although Mississippi has adopted these regulations to \nmaintain its equivalency with the Federal program, it has appropriately \nmaintained the Federal references. See 11 Miss. Admin. Code Pt. 3, Ch. \n1, R.1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.11, 1.13, 1.21.\n\nVIII. Who handles permits after the authorization takes effect?\n\n    When final authorization takes effect, Mississippi will issue \npermits for all the provisions for which it is authorized and will \nadminister the permits it issues. The EPA will continue to administer \nany RCRA hazardous waste permits or portions of permits that the EPA \nissued prior to the effective date of authorization until they expire \nor are terminated. The EPA will not issue any new permits or new \nportions of permits for the provisions listed in the table above after \nthe effective date of the final authorization. The EPA will continue to \nimplement and issue permits for HSWA requirements for which Mississippi \nis not yet authorized. The EPA has the authority to enforce state-\nissued permits after the State is authorized.\n\nIX. How does today's action affect Indian country in Mississippi?\n\n    Mississippi is not authorized to carry out its hazardous waste \nprogram in Indian country within the State, which includes the \nMississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Therefore, this action has no \neffect on Indian Country. The EPA retains jurisdiction over Indian \ncountry and will continue to implement and administer the RCRA program \non these lands.\n\nX. What is codification and is the EPA codifying Mississippi's \nhazardous waste program as authorized in this action?\n\n    Codification is the process of placing citations and references to \nthe State's statutes and regulations that comprise the State's \nauthorized hazardous waste program into the Code of Federal \nRegulations. The EPA does this by adding those citations and references \nto the authorized State rules in 40 CFR part 272. The EPA is not \ncodifying the authorization of Mississippi's revisions at this time. \nHowever, the EPA reserves the ability to amend 40 CFR part 272, subpart \nZ, for the authorization of Mississippi's program changes at a later \ndate.\n\nXI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\n\n    This action is not a significant regulatory action subject to \nreview by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive \nOrders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, \nJanuary 21, 2011). This action authorizes State requirements for the \npurpose of RCRA section 3006 and imposes no additional requirements \nbeyond those imposed by State law. Therefore, this action is not \nsubject to review by OMB. This action is not subject to Executive Order \n14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) because actions such as the \nauthorization of Mississippi's revised hazardous waste program under \nRCRA are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, I \ncertify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on \na substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Because this action authorizes pre-existing \nrequirements under State law and does not impose any additional \nenforceable duty beyond that required by State law, it does not contain \nany unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small \ngovernments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 \n(2 U.S.C. 1531-1538). For the same reason, this action also does not \nsignificantly or uniquely affect the communities of Tribal governments, \nas\n\n[[Page 22016]]\n\nspecified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). \nThis action will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on \nthe relationship between the National Government and the States, or on \nthe distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels \nof government, as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, \nAugust 10, 1999), because it merely authorizes State requirements as \npart of the State RCRA hazardous waste program without altering the \nrelationship or the distribution of power and responsibilities \nestablished by RCRA. This action also is not subject to Executive Order \n13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), because it is not economically \nsignificant and it does not make decisions based on environmental \nhealth or safety risks. This action is not subject to Executive Order \n13211, ``Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect \nEnergy Supply, Distribution, or Use'' (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001), \nbecause it is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order \n12866.\n    Under RCRA section 3006(b), the EPA grants a state's application \nfor authorization as long as the state meets the criteria required by \nRCRA. It would thus be inconsistent with applicable law for the EPA, \nwhen it reviews a state authorization application, to require the use \nof any particular voluntary consensus standard in place of another \nstandard that otherwise satisfies the requirements of RCRA. Thus, the \nrequirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and \nAdvancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) do not apply. As required \nby section 3 of Executive Order 12988 (61 FR 4729, February 7, 1996), \nin issuing this rule, the EPA has taken the necessary steps to \neliminate drafting errors and ambiguity, minimize potential litigation, \nand provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct. The EPA has \ncomplied with Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 15, 1988), by \nexamining the takings implications of this action in accordance with \nthe ``Attorney General's Supplemental Guidelines for the Evaluation of \nRisk and Avoidance of Unanticipated Takings'' issued under the \nexecutive order. This action does not impose an information collection \nburden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 \nU.S.C. 3501 et seq.). ``Burden'' is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b).\n    The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally \nprovides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating \nthe rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, \nto each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States. The EPA will submit a report containing this document \nand other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior \nto publication in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot take effect \nuntil 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. This \naction is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). This \nfinal action will be effective July 22, 2025.\n\nList of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 271\n\n    Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, \nConfidential business information, Hazardous waste, Hazardous waste \ntransportation, Indian lands, Intergovernmental relations, Penalties, \nReporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n    Authority: This action is issued under the authority of sections \n2002(a), 3006, and 7004(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as \namended, 42 U.S.C. 6912(a), 6926, and 6974(b).\n\n    Dated: May 7, 2025.\nKevin J.

These changes were outlined in a July 11, 2024, application \nto the EPA. We have determined that these changes satisfy all \nrequirements needed for final authorization.\n\nDATES: This authorization is effective on July 22, 2025 without further \nnotice unless the EPA receives adverse comment by June 23, 2025. If the \nEPA receives adverse comment, we will either publish a timely \nwithdrawal of this direct final action in the Federal Register \ninforming the public that the authorization will not take effect, or we \nwill publish a notification containing a response to comments that \neither reverses the decision or affirms that the final action will take \neffect. In the event that the final action is withdrawn, we would \naddress all public comments and make a final decision on authorization \nin a subsequent final action.\n\nADDRESSES: Submit your comments, identified by Docket ID No. EPA-R04-\nRCRA-2025-0146, at <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.

Why is the EPA using a direct final action?\n\n    The EPA is publishing this action without a prior proposed rule \nbecause we view this as a noncontroversial action and anticipate no \nadverse comment. This action is a routine program change. However, in \nthe ``Proposed Rules'' section of this issue of the Federal Register, \nwe are publishing a separate document that will serve as the proposed \nrule allowing the public an opportunity to comment. We will not \ninstitute a second comment period on this action. Any parties \ninterested in commenting must do so at this time. For further \ninformation about commenting on this action, see the ADDRESSES section \nof this document.\n    If the EPA receives adverse comments, we will either withdraw this \naction by publishing a document in the Federal Register before the \naction becomes effective, or we will publish a notice containing a \nresponse to comments that either reverses the decision or affirms that \nthe final action will take effect. In the event that the final action \nis withdrawn, the EPA would base any further decision on the \nauthorization of the State's program changes on the proposal mentioned \nin the previous paragraph and after consideration of all comments \nreceived during the comment period. We would then address all public \ncomments and make a final decision on authorization in a subsequent \nfinal action.\n\nII. Why are revisions to state programs necessary?\n\n    States that have received final authorization from the EPA under \nRCRA section 3006(b), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), must maintain a hazardous \nwaste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less \nstringent than the Federal program. As the Federal program changes, \nStates must change their programs and ask the EPA to authorize the \nchanges. Changes to State programs may be necessary when Federal or \nState statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain \nother changes occur. Most commonly, States must change their programs \nbecause of changes to the EPA's regulations in Title 40 of the Code of \nFederal Regulations (CFR), parts 124, 260 through 268, 270, 273, and \n279.\n    New Federal requirements and prohibitions imposed by Federal \nregulations that the EPA promulgates pursuant to the Hazardous and \nSolid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) take effect in authorized States \nat the same time they take effect in unauthorized States. Thus, the EPA \nshall have the authority to implement those requirements and \nprohibitions in Alabama, including the issuance of new permits \nimplementing those requirements, until the State is granted \nauthorization to do so.\n\nIII. What decisions has the EPA made in this action?\n\n    Alabama submitted a complete program revision application (PRA), \ndated July 11, 2024, seeking authorization of changes to its hazardous \nwaste program corresponding to certain Federal rules promulgated \nbetween July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2022 (including RCRA Cluster \\1\\ \nXXIII (Checklist \\2\\ 231), RCRA Cluster XXIV (Checklist 233 (A, B, C, \nD2, E)), RCRA Cluster XXV (Checklists 236 and 237), RCRA Cluster XXVI \n(Checklists 238 and 239), RCRA Cluster XXVII (Checklists 240 and 241), \nRCRA Cluster XXVIII (Checklist 242), RCRA Cluster XXIX (Checklist 243), \nand RCRA Cluster XXX (Checklist 244). The EPA concludes that Alabama's \napplication to revise its authorized program meets all of the statutory \nand regulatory requirements established under RCRA, as set forth in \nRCRA section 3006(b), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), and 40 CFR part 271. \nTherefore, the EPA grants Alabama final authorization to operate its \nhazardous waste program with the changes described in the PRA, and as \noutlined below in section VI of this document.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ A ``cluster'' is a grouping of hazardous waste rules that \nthe EPA promulgates from July 1st of one year to June 30th of the \nfollowing year.\n    \\2\\ A ``checklist'' is developed by the EPA for each Federal \nrule amending the RCRA regulations. The checklists document the \nchanges made by each Federal rule and are presented and numbered in \nchronological order by date of promulgation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Alabama has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and \ndisposal facilities within its borders (except in Indian country, as \ndefined at 18 U.S.C. 1151) and for carrying out the aspects of the RCRA \nprogram described in its PRA, subject to the limitations of HSWA, as \ndiscussed above.\n\nIV. What is the effect of this authorization decision?\n\n    The effect of this decision is that the changes described in \nAlabama's PRA as outlined below and in section VI of this document will \nbecome part of the authorized State hazardous waste program and will \ntherefore be federally enforceable. Alabama will continue to have \nprimary enforcement authority and responsibility for its State \nhazardous waste program. The EPA will maintain its authorities under \nRCRA sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003, including its authority to:\n    <bullet> Conduct inspections, and require monitoring, tests, \nanalyses, and reports;\n    <bullet> Enforce RCRA requirements, including authorized State \nprogram requirements, and suspend or revoke permits; and\n    <bullet> Take enforcement actions regardless of whether the State \nhas taken its own actions.\n    This action does not impose additional requirements on the \nregulated community because the regulations for which the EPA is \nauthorizing Alabama are already effective under State law and are not \nchanged by this action.\n\nV. What has Alabama previously been authorized for?\n\n    Alabama initially received final authorization on December 8, 1987, \neffective December 22, 1987 (52 FR 46466), to implement the RCRA \nhazardous waste management program. The EPA granted authorization for \nchanges to Alabama's program on the following dates: November 29, 1991, \neffective January 28, 1992 (56 FR 60926); May 13, 1992, effective July \n12, 1992 (57 FR 20422); October 21, 1992, effective December 21, 1992 \n(57 FR 47996); March 17, 1993, effective May 17, 1993 (58 FR 20422); \nSeptember 24, 1993, effective November 23, 1993 (58 FR 49932); February \n1, 1994, effective April 4, 1994 (59 FR 4594); November 14, 1994, \neffective January 13, 1995 (59 FR 56407); August 14, 1995, effective \nOctober 13, 1995 (60 FR 41818); February 14, 1996, effective April 15, \n1996 (61 FR 5718); April 25, 1996, effective June 24, 1996 (61 FR \n5718); November 21, 1997, effective February 10, 1998 (62 FR 62262); \nDecember 20, 2000, effective February 20, 2001 (65 FR 79769); March 15, \n2005, effective May 16, 2005 (70 FR 12593); June 2, 2005, effective \nAugust 1, 2005 (70 FR 32247); September 13, 2006, effective November \n13, 2006 (71 FR 53989); April 2, 2008, effective June 2, 2008 (73 FR \n17924); March 20, 2017, effective May 19, 2017 (82 FR 14327); and \nDecember 10, 2018, effective April 19, 2019 (83 FR 63461).\n\nVI. What changes is the EPA authorizing with this action?\n\n    Alabama submitted a complete PRA, dated July 11, 2024, seeking \nauthorization of changes to its hazardous waste management program in \naccordance with 40 CFR 271.21. This application included changes \nassociated with Checklists 231, 233, and 236 through 244 from RCRA \nClusters XXIII through XXX. The EPA has determined, subject to receipt \nof written comments\n\n[[Page 22018]]\n\nthat oppose this action, that Alabama's hazardous waste program \nrevisions are equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent \nthan the Federal program, and therefore satisfy all of the requirements \nnecessary to qualify for final authorization. Therefore, the EPA grants \nfinal authorization to Alabama for the following program changes:\n\n                                                     Table 1\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Description of Federal\n          requirement               Federal Register date and page           Analogous state authority \\1\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChecklist 231, Hazardous Waste   79 FR 7518; 2/7/2014...............  335-14-1-.01(2)(a) through (2)(c)2.; 335-\n Electronic Manifest Rule.                                             14-1-.02(1)(a)85., (1)(a)86., (1)(a)170.,\n                                                                       (1)(a)322.; 335-14-3-.02(1)(a)3. through\n                                                                       (1)(a)3.(ii), (5) through (5)(c), (5)(d)\n                                                                       through (f); 335-14-4-.02(1)(a)1. through\n                                                                       (1)(a)7.; 335-14-5-.05(2)(a)2. through\n                                                                       (2)(a)2.(vi), (2)(f) through (2)(k); \\2\\\n                                                                       and 335-14-6-.05(2)(a)2. through\n                                                                       (2)(a)2.(vi), (2)(f) through (2)(k).\nChecklist 219 (2008),\\3\\         73 FR 64668; 10/20/2008, 80 FR       335-14-1-.02(1)(a), (1)(a)3., (1)(a)51.\n Revisions to the Definition of   1694; 1/13/2015, 83 FR 24664; 5/30/  through (1)(a)51.(iv), (1)(a)108. through\n Solid Waste (DSW), as amended    2018.

Alabama will\n  replace ``this section'' with the appropriate citation in a future rulemaking.\n\\3\\ Alabama has adopted the 2008 Federal Revisions to the Definition of Solid Waste Rule, as amended on January\n  13, 2015, and May 30, 2018.\n\\4\\ The EPA is not authorizing the following language in Alabama's regulations at 335-14-2-.27, 335-14-2-.28,\n  and 335-14-2-.29: ``Any provision of 40 CFR Part 261, Subpart [AA/BB/CC, as applicable], which is inconsistent\n  with the provisions of ADEM Administrative Code, Division 14, is not incorporated herein by reference.'' In a\n  future rulemaking, Alabama will remove or revise the foregoing language in 335-14-2-.27, 335-14-2-.28, and 335-\n  14-2-.29, and any similar provisions elsewhere in Alabama's regulations, to clarify that the requirements of\n  Alabama's program must be at least as stringent as the analogous Federal program requirements.\n\\5\\ In Alabama's regulations at 335-14-6-.05(2)(c), there is an incorrect cross-reference to 335-14-2-.01(6).\n  The correct cross-reference is 335-14-3-.01(6). Alabama will correct the cross-reference in a future\n  rulemaking.\n\\6\\ In Alabama's regulations at 335-14-7-.16(1)(b), there is an incorrect cross-reference to 335-141-7-\n  .16(1)(d). The correct cross-reference is 335-14-7-.16(1)(d). Alabama will correct the cross-reference in a\n  subsequent rulemaking. Any reference to ``this subpart'' in 335-14-7-.16 refers to 335-14-7-.16. Any reference\n  to ``this section'' in 335-14-7-.16(2)(j)4. refers to 335-14-7-.16(2). Alabama will replace ``this subpart''\n  and ``this section'' with appropriate citations in a future rulemaking.\n\\7\\ In Alabama's regulations at 335-14-11-.07(1)(d), ``this part'' refers to 335-14-11. Alabama will replace\n  ``this part'' with the appropriate citation in a future rulemaking.\n\nVII. Where are the revised State rules different than the Federal \nrules?\n\n    When revised State rules differ from the Federal rules in the RCRA \nstate authorization process, the EPA determines whether the State rules \nare equivalent to, more stringent than, or broader in scope than the \nFederal program. Pursuant to RCRA section 3009, 42 U.S.C. 6929, State \nprograms may contain requirements that are more stringent than the \nFederal regulations. Such more stringent requirements can be federally \nauthorized and, once authorized, become federally enforceable. Although \nthe statute does not prevent States from adopting regulations that are \nbroader in scope than the Federal program, States cannot receive \nFederal authorization for such regulations, and they are not federally \nenforceable.\n    Alabama's program is broader in scope than the Federal program at \n40 CFR 262.18(c) by including a requirement at 335-14-3-.01(8)(c) that \ngenerators can offer hazardous waste only to transporters that have \nbeen issued an Alabama Hazardous Waste Transport Permit.\n    The EPA has determined that certain regulations included in \nAlabama's program revisions listed in Table 1 above are more stringent \nthan the Federal program. These more stringent requirements will become \npart of the federally enforceable RCRA program in Alabama when \nauthorized. The more stringent requirements are set forth in Table 2 \nbelow:\n\n                                                     Table 2\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Alabama more stringent provisions         Federal program                          Explanation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n335-14-1-.03(22)(a), 335-14-2-       40 CFR 260.42(a), 40 CFR     Alabama requires facilities that submit\n .01(4)(a)27.(vi)(I).                 261.4(a)(27)(vi)(A).         notifications of managing hazardous secondary\n                                                                   materials to update the notifications\n                                                                   annually, rather than biennially.\n335-14-3-.01(2)(f)(4)..............  40 CFR 262.11(f), 40 CFR     Alabama adds the following requirement: ``In\n                                      262.13.                      addition to the records described in 335-14-3-\n                                                                   .01(2)(f)1. through 3., a small or large\n                                                                   quantity generator must maintain sufficient\n                                                                   documentation to demonstrate the quantity of\n                                                                   hazardous waste generated each calendar\n                                                                   month.

These provisions include the \nrequirements associated with the operation of the national E-Manifest \nsystem and its user fee provisions contained in the Hazardous Waste \nElectronic Manifest User Fee Rule (Checklist 239). Although Alabama has \nadopted these regulations to maintain its equivalency with the Federal \nprogram, it has appropriately maintained the Federal references to \nreserve the EPA's authority to implement the non-delegable provisions \n(see 335-14-1-.01(4)(a)4. and (5)(b)2., 335-14-3-.02(2)(a)2.(f), 335-\n14-5-.05(2)(a)2.(v)(I)-(II) and (2)(j)2., 335-14-6-.05(2)(j)1.).\n    Because of the Federal Government's special role in matters of \nforeign policy, the EPA also does not authorize States to administer \nthe Federal import/export functions associated with the Revisions to \nthe Definition of Solid Waste (Checklist 233D2), Imports and Exports of \nHazardous Waste Rule (Checklist 236), the Confidentiality \nDeterminations for Hazardous Waste Export and Import Documents Rule \n(Checklist 238), and the Canada Import Export Recovery and Disposal \nCode Changes Rule (Checklist 244). Although Alabama has adopted these \nregulations to maintain its equivalency with the Federal program, it \nhas either appropriately maintained the Federal references in the \nState's regulations or incorporated the Federal regulations by \nreference (see 335-14-1-.02(1)(a)84.; 335-14-2-.01(4)(a)25.; 335-14-\n2-.05(1)(a)5.(ii), (1)(a)5.(v)(I), (1)(a)5.(v)(II)(B).I, \n(1)(a)5.(v)(II)(B)III., (1)(a)5.(v)(II)(B)VII., (1)(a)5.(vi), \n(1)(a)5.(ix); 335-14-3-.09; 335-14-4-.02(1)(a)2., (1)(c), (1)(e)2., \n(1)(f)2.; 335-14-5-.02(3)(a)1. through (3)(a)4.(ii); 335-14-\n5-.05(2)(a)3., (2)(d); 335-14-6-.02(3)(a)1. through (3)(a)4.(ii); 335-\n14-6-.05(2)(a)3., (2)(d)).\n\nVIII. Who handles permits after the authorization takes effect?\n\n    When final authorization takes effect, Alabama will issue permits \nfor all the provisions for which it is authorized and will administer \nthe permits it issues. The EPA will continue to administer any RCRA \nhazardous waste permits or portions of permits that the EPA issued \nprior to the effective date of authorization until they expire or are \nterminated. The EPA will not issue any new permits or new portions of \npermits for the provisions listed in the tables above after the \neffective date of the final authorization. The EPA will continue to \nimplement and issue permits for HSWA requirements for which Alabama is \nnot yet authorized. The EPA has the authority to enforce State-issued \npermits after the State is authorized.\n\nIX. How does today's action affect Indian country in Alabama?\n\n    Alabama is not authorized to carry out its hazardous waste program \nin Indian country within the State, which includes the Poarch Band of \nCreek Indians. Therefore, this action has no effect on Indian Country. \nThe EPA retains jurisdiction over Indian country and will continue to \nimplement and administer the RCRA program on these lands.\n\nX. What is codification and is the EPA codifying Alabama's hazardous \nwaste program as authorized in this action?\n\n    Codification is the process of placing citations and references to \nthe State's statutes and regulations that comprise the State's \nauthorized hazardous waste program into the Code of Federal \nRegulations. The EPA does this by adding those citations and references \nto the authorized State rules in 40 CFR part 272. The EPA is not \ncodifying the authorization of Alabama's revisions at this time. \nHowever, the EPA reserves the ability to amend 40 CFR part 272, subpart \nB, for the authorization of\n\n[[Page 22021]]\n\nAlabama's program changes at a later date.\n\nXI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\n\n    This action is not a significant regulatory action subject to \nreview by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive \nOrders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, \nJanuary 21, 2011). This action authorizes State requirements for the \npurpose of RCRA section 3006 and imposes no additional requirements \nbeyond those imposed by State law. Therefore, this action is not \nsubject to review by OMB. This action is not subject to Executive Order \n14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) because actions such as the \nauthorization of Alabama's revised hazardous waste program under RCRA \nare exempt from review under Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, I \ncertify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on \na substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Because this action authorizes pre-existing \nrequirements under State law and does not impose any additional \nenforceable duty beyond that required by State law, it does not contain \nany unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small \ngovernments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 \n(2 U.S.C. 1531-1538). For the same reason, this action also does not \nsignificantly or uniquely affect the communities of Tribal governments, \nas specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). \nThis action will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on \nthe relationship between the National Government and the States, or on \nthe distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels \nof government, as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, \nAugust 10, 1999), because it merely authorizes State requirements as \npart of the State RCRA hazardous waste program without altering the \nrelationship or the distribution of power and responsibilities \nestablished by RCRA. This action also is not subject to Executive Order \n13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), because it is not economically \nsignificant and it does not make decisions based on environmental \nhealth or safety risks. This action is not subject to Executive Order \n13211, ``Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect \nEnergy Supply, Distribution, or Use'' (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001), \nbecause it is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order \n12866.\n    Under RCRA section 3006(b), the EPA grants a state's application \nfor authorization as long as the state meets the criteria required by \nRCRA. It would thus be inconsistent with applicable law for the EPA, \nwhen it reviews a state authorization application, to require the use \nof any particular voluntary consensus standard in place of another \nstandard that otherwise satisfies the requirements of RCRA. Thus, the \nrequirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and \nAdvancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) do not apply. As required \nby section 3 of Executive Order 12988 (61 FR 4729, February 7, 1996), \nin issuing this rule, the EPA has taken the necessary steps to \neliminate drafting errors and ambiguity, minimize potential litigation, \nand provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct. The EPA has \ncomplied with Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 15, 1988), by \nexamining the takings implications of this action in accordance with \nthe ``Attorney General's Supplemental Guidelines for the Evaluation of \nRisk and Avoidance of Unanticipated Takings'' issued under the \nexecutive order. This action does not impose an information collection \nburden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 \nU.S.C. 3501 et seq.). ``Burden'' is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b).\n    The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally \nprovides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating \nthe rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, \nto each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States. The EPA will submit a report containing this document \nand other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior \nto publication in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot take effect \nuntil 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. This \naction is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). This \nfinal action will be effective July 22, 2025.\n\nList of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 271\n\n    Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, \nConfidential business information, Hazardous waste, Hazardous waste \ntransportation, Indian lands, Intergovernmental relations, Penalties, \nReporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n    Authority: This action is issued under the authority of sections \n2002(a), 3006, and 7004(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as \namended, 42 U.S.C. 6912(a), 6926, and 6974(b).\n\n    Dated: May 7, 2025.\nKevin J.

Under 5 CFR part \n1320, an agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information \nunless it displays a current, valid OMB Control Number.\n    No person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply \nwith a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act \nthat does not display a current, valid OMB Control Number. The OMB \nControl Number for the information collection requirements in 47 CFR \n73.404 and 73.406 is 3060-1034.\n    The foregoing notice is required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of \n1995, Public Law 104-13, October 1, 1995, and 44 U.S.C. 3507.\n    The total annual reporting burdens and costs for the respondents \nare as follows:\n    OMB Control Number: 3060-1034.\n    Title: Digital Audio Broadcasting Systems and their Impact on the \nTerrestrial Radio Broadcast Service; Form 2100, Schedule 335-FM--FM \nDigital Notification; Form 2100, Schedule 335-AM--AM Digital \nNotification.\n    Form Number: Form 2100, Schedule 335-FM.\n    Respondents: Business or other for-profit entities.\n    Number of Respondents and Responses: 215 respondents; 215 \nresponses.\n    Estimated Hours per Response: 1 hour-8 hours.\n    Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement.\n    Total Annual Burden: 345 hours.\n    Total Annual Cost: $128,250.\n    Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain benefits. The \nstatutory authority for this collection of information is contained in \nsections 154(i), 303, 310 and 553 of the Communications Act of 1934, as \namended.\n    Needs and Uses: On September 24, 2024, the Commission adopted the \nFirst Report and Order in the Modifying Rules for FM Terrestrial \nDigital Audio Broadcasting System, MB Docket No. 22-405, FCC 24-105 (FM \nDigital First R&O) proceeding, to allow digital FM station operation \nwith asymmetric power on the digital sidebands. This asymmetric \nsideband operation will allow digital FM stations to operate with \ndifferent power levels on the upper and lower digital sidebands, as a \nway to facilitate greater digital FM radio coverage without interfering \nwith adjacent-channel FM stations, upon notification to the Commission \non FCC Form 2100, Schedule 335-FM. Prior to adoption of the FM Digital \nFirst R&O, an FM digital station that wished to employ asymmetric \nsideband operation had to apply for an experimental authorization and \nrenew that authorization annually. Initiating such operation by \nnotification rather than experimental authorization will be simpler and \nless expensive to the licensee, and thus less burdensome. Additionally, \neliminating the requirement of annual experimental authorization will \nremove a regulatory barrier and incentivize more digital FM stations to \nadopt such operations. This submission was therefore made to OMB for \napproval of new or modified Information Collection requirements \nstemming from the FM Digital First R&O.\n    The changes as adopted in the FM Digital First R&O require \nmodifications to Schedule 335-FM and rule Sec. Sec.  73.404 and 73.406. \nSpecifically, the FM Digital First R&O permits digital FM stations to \nuse asymmetric sideband operation by notifying the Commission using \nSchedule 335-FM, and modifies that schedule by including fields to \nreport the digital ERP being transmitted on each digital sideband, as \nwell as the total digital ERP. Therefore, Schedule 335-FM is being \namended to provide fields for the notifying station to indicate the \ndigital ERP transmitted on each digital sideband, as well as the total \ndigital ERP.\n    The Commission also made an administrative change to the procedures \nused by FM station licensees seeking to increase digital power above -\n14 dBc. Those requests, previously submitted by ``informal request,'' \nwill now be submitted using Schedule 335-FM. After the effective date \nof the rules adopted in the First Digital R&O, digital FM stations must \nuse Schedule 335-FM to request an increase in total digital ERP above -\n14 dBc, using Table 1 to 73.404(f), and will also report certain \ndigital power decreases on Schedule 335-FM. In sum, after the effective \ndate of the FM Digital First R&O, a digital FM station will report the \nfollowing actions (or request authority in the case of an increase of \ntotal digital ERP above -14 dBc) by submitting Schedule 335-FM: the \ninitiation of hybrid digital operation; the initiation of asymmetric \nsideband operation at any power level, as well as the discontinuance of \nasymmetric sideband operation; an increase of total digital ERP above -\n14 dBc; or a decrease in total digital ERP from a level above -14 dBc \nto a level at or below -14 dBc. As required with the current informal \nrequest process, a station choosing to operate with total digital ERP \nbetween -14 dBc and -10 dBc must attach an exhibit demonstrating that \nthe proposed FM digital ERP is permitted for each digital sideband, \nusing Table 1 to 73.404(f). This exhibit will now be an attachment to \nthe Schedule 335-FM submission. As is the case with the current \ninformal request process, a digital FM station choosing to operate with \ntotal digital ERP above -14 dBc may initiate such operation upon \napproval from the Commission.\n    Schedule 335-FM is amended as follows:\n    a. To include a question for the notifying station to report when \nasymmetric sideband operations commenced.\n    b. To provide fields for the notifying station to indicate the \ndigital ERP transmitted on each digital sideband, as well as the total \ndigital ERP.\n    c. To include a question for the notifying station to report that \nit has discontinued digital broadcasts and/or asymmetric sideband \noperations, and provide the date of the discontinuance.\n    d. To include a question for the notifying station to report that \nthe total digital ERP (listed in a previous item of the schedule) is \ngreater than -14 dBc. A station choosing to operate with total digital \nERP between -14 dBc and -10 dBc must attach an exhibit demonstrating \nthat the proposed FM digital ERP is permitted for each digital \nsideband, using Table 1 in Sec.  73.404(f).\n    e. To include a question for the notifying station to report a \ndecrease in the total digital ERP to -14 dBc or below, and provide the \ndate on which such decreased digital ERP operations commenced.\n    Moreover, to implement the new or modified information collection \nrequirements contained in the FM Digital First R&O, Sec.  73.404(e) and \n(f) of\n\n[[Page 22023]]\n\nthe rules are revised to allow digital FM stations to use asymmetric \npower on the digital sidebands and to use the ``Maximum permissible FM \ndigital ERP per-sideband'' Table to comport with the current limits on \nFM digital ERP.\n    Additionally, the newly adopted digital FM notification \nrequirements are added to rule Sec.  73.406 in new paragraphs (d)(5) \nand (d)(6).\n\nFederal Communications Commission.\nMarlene Dortch,\nSecretary.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09278 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6712-01-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

In 2003, the IATTC updated \nthe 1949 Convention through the adoption of the Convention for the \nStrengthening of the IATTC Established by the 1949 Convention between \nthe United States of America and the Republic of Costa Rica (Antigua \nConvention). The Antigua Convention entered into force in 2010. The \nUnited States acceded to the Antigua Convention on February 24, 2016. \nThe full text of the Antigua Convention is available at: <a href=\"https://www.iattc.org/PDFFiles2/Antigua_Convention_Jun_2003.pdf\">https://www.iattc.org/PDFFiles2/Antigua_Convention_Jun_2003.pdf</a>.\n    The IATTC consists of 21 member nations and 5 cooperating non-\nmember nations. The IATTC is responsible for the conservation and \nmanagement of tuna and tuna-like species in the IATTC Convention Area. \nThe IATTC Convention Area is defined as waters of the EPO within the \narea bounded by the west coast of the Americas and by 50[deg] N \nlatitude, 150[deg] W longitude, and 50[deg] S latitude. The IATTC \nmaintains a scientific research and fishery monitoring program and \nregularly assesses the status of tuna, sharks, and billfish stocks in \nthe IATTC Convention Area to determine appropriate catch limits and \nother measures deemed necessary to promote sustainable fisheries and \nprevent the overexploitation of these stocks.\n\nInternational Obligations of the United States Under the Antigua \nConvention\n\n    As a Party to the Antigua Convention and a member of the IATTC, the \nUnited States is legally bound to implement decisions of the IATTC \nunder the TCA of 1950, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 951 et seq. (Pub. L. 114-\n81). The TCA directs the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of State and, with respect to enforcement measures, the \nU.S. Coast Guard, to promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to \ncarry out the United States' obligations under the Antigua Convention, \nincluding recommendations and decisions adopted by the IATTC. The \nauthority of the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate such regulations \nhas been delegated to NMFS.\n\nIATTC Resolution on Tropical Tuna Conservation\n\n    The 102nd Meeting of the IATTC was held in Panama City, Panama, in \nSeptember 2024. At this meeting, the IATTC adopted Resolution C-24-01 \n(Conservation Measures for Tropical Tunas In The Eastern Pacific Ocean \nDuring 2025-2026). Many of the provisions in Resolution C-24-01 are \nidentical in content to those contained in the previous tropical tuna \nResolution (C-21-04; Conservation Measures for Tropical Tuna in the \nEastern Pacific Ocean During 2022-2024), which NMFS implemented in a \nJuly 8, 2022 rulemaking (87 FR 40731), and are in effect until they are \namended or replaced. Resolution C-24-01 continues to include provisions \nfor a 72-day EPO fishing closure period for purse seine vessels, \nexemptions from that closure period due to force majeure, catch limits \nof bigeye tuna caught in the EPO for longline vessels greater than 24 m \nin overall length, catch limit transfer requirements for bigeye tuna, a \nrequirement that all tropical tuna be retained and landed (with some \nexceptions), and restrictions on the use and design of fish aggregating \ndevices (FADs).\n    In addition to continuing the existing measures, Resolution C-24-01 \nrequires the IATTC to reexamine the Resolution at the annual IATTC \nmeeting in 2025 or 2026 based on a yellowfin tuna benchmark assessment \nor, if a benchmark assessment is not available, the current stock \nassessment, as long as it is deemed reliable by IATTC scientific staff \nat that time. Based on that review, if necessary, the Resolution \nprovides that the IATTC will take actions to reduce fishing pressure on \nyellowfin tuna to a level that allows for sustainable fishing. \nAlternatively, if the benchmark assessment or stock assessment shows \nthat the yellowfin tuna stock is not overfished nor subject to \noverfishing, the IATTC will consider options for new measures that \nreduce the number of days of closure or the elimination of the \n``corralito'' closure\n\n[[Page 22024]]\n\narea, which NMFS currently has implemented in 50 CFR 300.25(e)(1) and \n300.25(e)(6). If action is taken by the IATTC in 2025 and a new \nResolution is adopted, NMFS will consider additional action as \nappropriate.\n    The implementation of this Resolution by all IATTC members is \nintended to prevent overfishing of tropical tuna stocks in the EPO. \nBased on 2024 IATTC benchmark stock assessments and applying the stock \nstatus criteria NMFS identified in the Highly Migratory Species \nFisheries Management Plan (HMS FMP), the bigeye and skipjack tuna \nstocks in the EPO are not subject to overfishing and are not \noverfished. Based on the most recent IATTC benchmark assessment (2020) \nfor yellowfin tuna in the EPO, NMFS determined the stock is neither \noverfished nor subject to overfishing. Efforts to complete a new \nbenchmark assessment for yellowfin tuna are underway, and results are \nanticipated within the next 2 years.\n    For the 2024 meeting of the IATTC, the IATTC scientific staff \nrecommended that conservation measures from tropical tuna Resolution C-\n21-04 be extended to prevent overfishing of these stocks. Those \nmeasures are already codified and will continue under this rule, as \ndiscussed in the following section.\n    NMFS published a proposed rule on December 5, 2024 (89 FR 96631), \nfor public review and comment. The comment period closed on January 6, \n2025. The preamble to the proposed rule contains additional background \ninformation that is not repeated here.\n\nFinal Regulations\n\n    This rule is implemented under the TCA (16 U.S.C. 951 et seq.) and \nincludes minor changes to 50 CFR part 300, subpart C. The rule will \napply to U.S. commercial fishing vessels using purse seine and longline \ngear to catch tropical tuna in the IATTC Convention Area. As noted in \nthe preamble to the proposed rule, most of the measures in Resolution \nC-24-01 do not need to be implemented through this rule because the \nResolution continues existing measures that are already codified and do \nnot expire (see 87 FR 40731, July 8, 2022). A full list of those \ncodified measures is included in the preamble of the proposed rule and \nis not repeated here.\n    This rule extends the applicability of the system of additional \nclosure days for class size 4-6 purse seine vessels that exceed \nspecified annual catch levels for bigeye tuna that was in place for \ncalendar years 2023 and 2024 (50 CFR 300.25(e)(2)). Under this rule, \nthose regulations remain in effect for 2025 and future calendar years. \nThe catch levels continue to begin at 1,200 mt of bigeye tuna with 10 \nadditional closure days and increase incrementally by 300 mt and 3 \nadditional closure days beyond that level. U.S. purse seine vessels \nthat exceed a certain annual catch level of bigeye tuna are required to \nincrease the number of closure days they observe in the following year, \nas specified in table 1.\n\n Table 1--Bigeye Tuna Catch Levels and Corresponding Additional Closure\n                                  Days\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                            Additional\n                Catch level (mt) exceeded                  closure days\n                                                             observed\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1,200...................................................              10\n1,500...................................................              13\n1,800...................................................              16\n2,100...................................................              19\n2,400...................................................              22\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As was true for 2023 and 2024, the additional days of closure must \nbe added to one of the two closure periods indicated in 50 CFR \n300.25(e)(1), which requires purse seine vessels to observe one of two \nspecified 72-day closure periods. For vessels observing the first \nclosure period, the additional days must be added at the beginning of \nthe closure period. For vessels observing the second closure period, \nthe additional days must be added to the end of the closure period.\n    This rule also makes minor revisions to 50 CFR 300.28(c), to \nclarify the active FAD limits applicable for 2025 and future calendar \nyears. Specifically, this rule updates Table 1 to paragraph (c), which \ncontains the active FAD limits for purse seine vessels by well volume, \nby removing the expired limits (i.e., limits for calendar years 2022 \nand 2023) and leaving only those limits that apply for 2025 and future \ncalendar years (i.e., limits that were specified in the previous table \nas applying ``For 2024 calendar year and beyond''). The current limits \nare shown in table 2.\n\n           Table 2--Active FAD Limits for Purse Seine Vessels\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                            Active FAD\n            Well volume (cubic meters (m\\3\\))                  limit\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1,200 or more...........................................             340\n426-1,199...............................................             210\n213-425.................................................              85\n0-212...................................................              50\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Although Resolution C-24-01 is in effect through 2026, NMFS does \nnot intend for these regulations to expire concurrently with the \nResolution. Instead, because the IATTC will likely continue to adopt \nsimilar conservation and management measures upon expiration of this \nresolution, and to avoid a lapse in the management of the fishery that \nmay occur between expiration of the regulations and implementation of \nnew measures adopted by the IATTC, these regulations will remain in \neffect unless and until they are amended or replaced.\n    The TCA gives NMFS the authority to promulgate such regulations as \nmay be necessary to carry out the United States' international \nobligations under the Convention and this chapter, including \nrecommendations and decisions adopted by the IATTC. In past years, NMFS \nhas implemented IATTC resolutions for specific calendar years, and this \napproach has at times led to lapses in management in the affected \nfisheries in subsequent years. Given the time-consuming nature of the \nU.S. domestic rulemaking process, combined with the frequent delayed \nadoption of IATTC resolutions, implementing domestic measures that do \nnot expire unless and until new measures are in place is necessary to \ncarry out the United States' international obligations under the \nAntigua Convention and the TCA because it will ensure there is no lapse \nin management of the tropical tuna fishery in the EPO.\n    Thus, regulations will remain in effect until they are amended or \nreplaced. NMFS intends to publish proposed and final rules to implement \nnew resolutions adopted by the IATTC as expeditiously as possible; \nhowever, this approach will allow existing regulations to remain in \nforce and prevent any lapse in regulatory coverage caused by \nexpirations.\n    Because the IATTC adopted Resolution C-24-01 as a 2-year \nconservation and management measure (2025-2026), the supporting \nanalyses for this rule (discussed later in the Classification section) \ncover a 2-year time period, with the understanding that NMFS will \nconsider whether these analyses will need to be supplemented should the \nmeasures remain in effect for more than 2 years.\n\nPublic Comments and Responses\n\n    NMFS received one comment during the 30-day comment period on the \nproposed rule, which closed on January 6, 2025. The comment was from a \nmember of the general public and was supportive of the proposed \nregulation change, as they felt it aligns with long term benefits for \nthe marine ecosystem and promotes sustainable fisheries management. \nHowever, they did express\n\n[[Page 22025]]\n\ntwo concerns with the proposed rule text which are addressed below.\n    Issue #1: The commenter noted ``in order for this new regulation to \ntruly work there needs to be effective enforcement. If there is not \nadequate monitoring and enforcement, the whole regulation may be \nundermined as the catch limits and habitat protection may be ignored.''\n    NMFS Response: NMFS recognizes the importance of monitoring and \nenforcement for effective fisheries management. The IATTC informs NMFS \nif a possible instance of non-compliance arises. If warranted, NMFS \nworks with the Office of Law Enforcement to investigate and take \nappropriate action.\n    Issue #2: The commenter noted ``concerns about . . . the economic \nimpacts on smaller fishing communities. Local small-scale fisheries \noften rely on certain species, so tightening the catch limits \nnegatively affects these smaller fisheries.''\n    NMFS Response: NMFS notes that catch limits are not being tightened \nin this rule and that the bigeye tuna catch limits for purse seine \nvessels which have been in place for several years are being extended \nuntil modified or replaced. The economic impacts to small vs large \nentities is discussed in the classification section and NMFS concluded \nthat the action is not expected to have a significant adverse economic \nimpact on the profitability of a substantial number of small entities \nor a disproportionate economic effect on small entities relative to \nlarge entities. In response to this comment, NMFS has revised the RIR \nand the Regulatory Flexibility Act discussion in the Classification \nsection to further support that the action is not expected to have a \nsignificant adverse economic impact.\n\nChanges From Proposed Rule\n\n    After consideration of public comments on the proposed rule, NMFS \ndoes not intend to make any substantive changes in the final rule.\n    NMFS is making one minor change to the final regulatory text for 50 \nCFR 300.25(e)(2). Specifically, to clarify that all measures related to \nthe system of additional closure days in place for 2023 and 2024 are \nbeing extended and continue to apply in 2025 and beyond, NMFS is \nrevising the final regulatory text to include both subparagraphs of \nSec.  300.25(e)(2), instead of just subparagraph (e)(2)(i). The text of \nsubparagraph (e)(2)(ii) is unchanged from the corresponding \nsubparagraph put in place by the previous rule (see 87 FR 40731, July \n8, 2022).\n\nClassification\n\n    The NMFS Assistant Administrator has determined that this rule is \nconsistent with the TCA and other applicable laws, subject to further \nconsideration after public comment.\n\nExecutive Order 12866\n\n    This rule is not an Executive Order 14192 regulatory action because \nthis action is not significant under Executive Order 12866.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This final rule does not contain changes to the collection of \ninformation requirement for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act \nof 1995. The existing collection of information requirements would \ncontinue to apply under the following Office of Management and Business \n(OMB) Control Numbers: 0648-0214 (Pacific Islands Region Logbook Family \nof Forms) and 0648-0148 (West Coast Region Pacific Tuna Fisheries \nLogbook, Fish Aggregating Device Form, and Observer Safety Reporting).\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, no person is \nrequired to respond to, and no person shall be subject to penalty for \nfailure to comply with, a collection of information subject to the \nrequirements of the PRA, unless that collection of information displays \na currently valid OMB control number. All currently approved NOAA \ncollections of information may be viewed at: <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain\">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the \nChief Counsel for Regulation of the Department of Commerce certified to \nthe Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration \nthat this rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact \non a substantial number of small entities. The rationale for the \ncertification is provided in the following paragraphs.\n    For Regulatory Flexibility Act purposes only, NMFS has established \na small business size standard of $11 million in annual gross receipts \nfor businesses, including their affiliates, whose primary industry is \ncommercial fishing (see 50 CFR 200.2). This standard applies to all \nbusinesses classified under North American Industry Classification \nSystem (NAICS) code 11411 for commercial fishing, including all \nbusinesses classified as commercial finfish fishing (NAICS 114111), \ncommercial shellfish fishing (NAICS 114112), and other commercial \nmarine fishing (NAICS 114119) businesses.\n    NMFS prepared the following analyses for this regulatory action in \nlight of this size standard. All of the entities directly regulated by \nthis regulatory action are commercial finfish fishing businesses. Under \nthis size standard, some U.S. purse seine vessels affected by this \naction are considered large, and some are small businesses. The \nlongline vessels this action applies to are considered to be small \nbusinesses based on above standards.\n    U.S. Purse Seine Vessels Fishing in the IATTC Convention Area: \nThere are two components to the U.S. tuna purse seine fishery in the \nEPO: (1) large purse seine vessels (class size 6; greater than 363 mt \ncarrying capacity) that typically have been based in the western and \ncentral Pacific Ocean (WCPO), and (2) coastal purse seine vessels with \nsmaller fish hold volumes (class sizes 2-3; between 46-181 mt carrying \ncapacity) that are based on the U.S. West Coast. Although Resolution C-\n24-01 and the implementing regulations include restrictions for class \nsize 4-5 (182-363 mt carrying capacity) purse seine vessels, there are \ncurrently no U.S. vessels of class sizes 4-5 registered to fish in the \nIATTC Convention Area, nor have there been in the past 10 years. \nTherefore, to the extent the regulations specify application to class \nsize 4-5 purse seine vessels, they are not expected to have any impact \non U.S. vessel owners or operators.\n    As of September 2024, the United States has 14 active large U.S. \npurse seine vessels on the IATTC Regional Vessel Register authorized to \nfish in the EPO. Twelve of these vessels also have Western and Central \nPacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) Area Endorsements. WCPFC Area \nEndorsements are NMFS-issued authorizations required for a vessel to \nfish commercially for HMS on the high seas in the WCPFC Convention \nArea. NMFS used cannery data from the IATTC and Regional Purse Seine \nLogbook (RPL) data from Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center to \nestimate fish landings in both the EPO and WCPO for the vessels that \nfished in both Convention Areas within a year.\n    Because neither gross receipts nor ex-vessel price information \nspecific to individual fishing vessels are available to NMFS, NMFS \napplied regional price data--as approximations of ex-vessel prices--to \nannual catches of individual vessels obtained from RPLs and IATTC \nobserver data, to estimate the vessels' annual receipts.\n    Using this approach, NMFS estimates that among the affected \nvessels, the\n\n[[Page 22026]]\n\nrange in average annual per-vessel receipts in 2021-2023 was $500,000 \nto $13.4 million with an average of approximately $10 million. Nine of \nthe active purse seine vessels had estimated average annual receipts of \nless than $11 million, and thus are considered to be small entities. \nThe remaining five are considered large businesses.\n    U.S. Longline Vessels that Fish in the IATTC Convention Area: As of \nSeptember 2024, the IATTC Regional Vessel Register lists 35 large-scale \nlongline vessels (i.e., greater than 24 m in overall length) that have \nthe option to fish in the IATTC Convention Area. The majority of these \nlongline vessels have Hawaii Longline Limited Access Permits (issued \nunder 50 CFR 665.13). Under the Hawaii longline limited access program, \nno more than 164 permits may be issued. The Hawaii longline fisheries \ninclude a tuna-targeting (including bigeye tuna) deep-set fishery and \nswordfish-targeting shallow-set fishery. Additionally, there are U.S. \nlongline vessels based on the U.S. West Coast, some of which operate \nunder the Pacific HMS permit and high seas permits. U.S. West Coast-\nbased longline vessels operating under the Pacific HMS permit fish \nprimarily in the EPO and are currently restricted to fishing with deep-\nset longline gear outside of the U.S. West Coast exclusive economic \nzone.\n    Between 2019 and 2023, longline vessels that fished in the IATTC \nConvention Area had average ex-vessel revenues ranging from $197,301 to \n$255,985 for total landings, including those in the EPO and WCPO. The \nmaximum ex-vessel revenue of any longline vessel that fished in the \nIATTC Convention Area was well below the $11 million threshold for \nfinfish harvesting businesses. Therefore, all of the longline vessels \nimpacted by the rule will be considered small business entities.\n    Economic Impacts: The action is not expected to have a significant \nadverse economic impact on the profitability of a substantial number of \nsmall entities or a disproportionate economic effect on small entities \nrelative to large entities. The entities impacted by the action related \nto purse seine vessels are considered to include both large and small \nbusinesses, and the entities impacted by the action related to longline \nvessels are considered to be small businesses. All of the measures in \nthe Resolution maintain purse seine and longline measures that have \nbeen in place in U.S. regulations for years and have become routine for \nthe purse seine and longline fleets. As described above, the IATTC \nextended the measures to prevent overfishing.\n    As discussed previously, this rule extends the applicability of the \nsystem of additional closure days for class size 4-6 purse seine \nvessels that exceed specified annual catch levels for bigeye tuna that \nwas in place for calendar years 2023 and 2024. This action therefore \nwill continue to add 10 closure days for purse seine vessels that catch \nmore than 1,200 mt of bigeye tuna, and will continue to add 3 \nadditional closure days for every additional 300 mt caught beyond the \n1,200 mt. In reviewing catch levels for U.S. purse seine vessels from \n2017-2020, only one U.S. vessel caught more than 1,200 mt in a single \nyear. Since the 2022 rulemaking was put in place, no U.S. vessels have \ncaught more than 1,200 mt in a single year. Thus, it is not expected \nthat many, if any, U.S. vessels will be required to adhere to \nadditional closure days. For vessels that may need to observe \nadditional closure days, the majority of vessels have the option to \nfish in the WCPO, pending closures in the WCPFC Convention Area, noting \nthat tropical tuna stocks in the WCPO are considered distinct from EPO \nstocks.\n    In addition to extending the applicability of the system of \nadditional closure days, the 2024 tropical tuna Resolution maintains a \nnumber of purse seine regulations that have been in place for years, \nand the purse seine fleet is familiar with these measures. Because the \nIATTC adopted the previous tropical tuna resolution, C-21-04, as a \nthree-year conservation and management measure (2022-2024), the \nsupporting analyses for that rule covered a three-year time period, \nwith the understanding that those analyses would be supplemented should \nthe measures remain in effect for more than three years. Resolution C-\n24-01 maintains those measures and those analyses are discussed below.\n    FAD limits: As previously discussed, this rule makes minor \nrevisions to clarify the active FAD limits applicable for 2025 and \nfuture calendar years by updating the table which contains the active \nFAD limits for purse seine vessels by well volume, by removing the \nexpired limits (i.e., limits for calendar years 2022 and 2023) and \nleaving only those limits that apply for 2025 and future calendar years \n(i.e., limits that were specified in the previous table as applying \n``For 2024 calendar year and beyond''). With respect to limits on \nactive FADs, all large U.S. purse seine vessels currently on the IATTC \nRegional Vessel Register have a well volume of 1,200 m\\3\\ or more. \nTherefore, the limit of 340 active FADs per large U.S. purse seine \nvessel will continue to apply in 2025 and beyond. According to 2018-\n2020 purse seine effort data provided by IATTC scientific staff, the \naverage number of active FADs per U.S. vessel is approximately 90 and \nthe maximum number per vessel is 271. Since the 2022 rulemaking began \nto gradually decrease active FAD limits to their current limits, U.S. \npurse seine vessels have continued to operate within the established \nlimits. Thus, these regulations are not expected to reduce the number \nof active FADs any U.S. purse seine vessel has in the water. As a \nresult, the continuation of these measures is not expected to reduce \nthe profitability of the fishery, and no disproportionate impacts \nbetween small and large businesses are expected.\n    Buoy restrictions: This rule maintains existing restrictions on \nbuoy deactivations and reactivations which have been in place since \n2022 and are not expected to substantially change the fishing behavior \nof the U.S. fleet. In addition, although there were additional \nreporting requirements for active FADs, deactivations, and \nreactivations, vessel operators were already expected to be collecting \nthe necessary information from satellite companies as part of current \noperations, and therefore reporting this additional information is \nstill not expected to impose an additional burden that would reduce \nprofitability.\n    Reporting requirements: This rule maintains requirements for \nreporting cannery data to the IATTC and making data available to NMFS \nupon request, as well as requirements for NMFS to report VMS data to \nthe IATTC beginning in 2023. Cannery data was already being collected \nby purse seine vessel owners as a part of current operations. Vessel \nowners did not need to change any reporting requirements for VMS data \nbecause those data were already provided to NMFS and NMFS provides it \nto the IATTC. Therefore, NMFS still does not expect these reporting \nrequirements to reduce the profitability of the fishery or have a \ndisproportionate impact between small and large businesses.\n    Force majeure: This rule maintains existing regulations that \nvessels to request an exemption from observing a full 72-day closure \nperiod due to the occurrence of a force majeure events. Since 2013, \nwhen the force majeure provisions first went into effect, the United \nStates has requested force majeure exemptions seven times. Because U.S. \nforce majeure events are rare and unpredictable, it is difficult to \nspeculate future situations where a U.S. vessel would need to request \nforce\n\n[[Page 22027]]\n\nmajeure. The economic effects from these revisions are generally \npositive for vessels that are granted an exemption due to force \nmajeure, as the measure provides relief to U.S. purse seine vessels \nthat experience an unforeseen circumstance and would otherwise fish \nfewer days in a calendar year.\n    In summary, the action is not expected to substantially change the \ntypical fishing practices of affected vessels. Any impact to the income \nof U.S. vessels is expected to be minor. Therefore, NMFS has determined \nthat the action is not expected to have a significant economic impact \non a substantial number of small entities, or a disproportionate \neconomic impact on the small entities relative to the large entities. \nTherefore, an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required \nand none has been prepared.\n\nExecutive Order 13175\n\n    NMFS has determined that this action will not have a substantial \ndirect effect on one or more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between \nthe Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of \npower and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian \nTribes; therefore, consultation with Tribal officials under Executive \nOrder 13175 is not required, and the requirements of sections (5)(b) \nand (5)(c) of Executive Order 13175 also do not apply. A Tribal summary \nimpact statement under section (5)(b)(2)(B) and section (5)(c)(2)(B) of \nExecutive Order is not required and has not been prepared.\n\nList of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 300\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Fish, Fisheries, Fishing, \nMarine resources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Treaties.\n\n    Dated: May 19, 2025.\nJonathan Marc Kurland,\nActing Deputy Assistant Administrator for Regulatory Programs, National \nMarine Fisheries Service.\n\n    For the reasons set out in the preamble, NMFS amends 50 CFR part \n300, subpart C, as follows:\n\nPART 300--INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES REGULATIONS\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 300, subpart C, continues to read as \nfollows:\n\n    Authority:  16 U.S.C. 951 et seq.\n\n\n0\n2.

AD 2020-06-13 requires \ndetermining the accumulated hours time-in-service (TIS) of certain \npart-numbered main gearbox (MGB) suspension bar rear attachment \nfittings (fittings) and bolts and establishes reduced life limits. \nSince the FAA issued AD 2020-06-13, it was determined that modifying \nthe MGB suspension bar fittings link and installing improved MGB \nsuspension bar fitting bolts are necessary. This proposed AD would \nrequire modifying the MGB suspension bar link, installing newly-\ndesigned bolts, and prohibit installing certain parts. The FAA is \nproposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.\n\nDATES: The FAA must receive comments on this NPRM by July 7, 2025.\n\nADDRESSES: You may send comments, using the procedures found in 14 CFR \n11.43 and 11.45, by any of the following methods:\n    <bullet> Federal eRulemaking Portal: Go to <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a>.

Any commentary that the FAA receives which is \nnot specifically designated as CBI will be placed in the public docket \nfor this rulemaking.\n\nBackground\n\n    The FAA issued AD 2020-06-13, Amendment 39-19882 (85 FR 19080, \nApril 6, 2020) (AD 2020-06-13), for Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, \nAS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters with an MGB suspension bar \nright-hand (RH) side rear fitting part number (P/N) 330A22-2702-07 and \nbolt P/N 330A22-0135-20, MGB suspension bar left-hand (LH) side rear \nfitting P/N 330A22-2702-06 and bolt P/N 330A22-0135-20, or MGB \nsuspension bar front bolt P/N 330A22-0134-20 installed. AD 2020-06-13 \nwas prompted by an MCAI originated by EASA, which is the Technical \nAgent for the Member States of the European Union. EASA issued AD 2018-\n0260, dated December 3, 2018 (EASA AD 2018-0260), to address MGB \nsuspension bar fittings and bolts remaining in service beyond their \nfatigue life. From review of reported Model EC 225 LP data, EASA \nadvised that the installation of the MGB upper deck fittings of the \nthree MGB suspension bars (front, RH side rear, and LH side rear) could \nlead to tightening torque loss on the fittings' attachment screws \n(bolts). Due to design similarities, Model AS 332 C, AS 332 C1, AS 332 \nL, and AS 332 L1 helicopters could also be affected by the same \ninstallation condition.\n    AD 2020-06-13 requires determining the total hours TIS of the MGB \nsuspension bar RH side and LH side rear fittings, removing these \nfittings and bolts from service based on the accumulated total hours \nTIS and other conditions, and thereafter removing these fittings and \nbolts from service within specific intervals. AD 2020-06-13 also \nrequires removing the front bolts from service during each major \ninspection ``G.'' The FAA issued AD 2020-06-13 to prevent failure of an \nMGB attachment assembly, detachment of an MGB suspension bar, and \nconsequent loss of helicopter control.\n\nActions Since AD 2020-06-13 Was Issued\n\n    Since the FAA issued AD 2020-06-13, EASA superseded EASA AD 2018-\n0260 and issued EASA AD 2023-0194, dated November 8, 2023 (EASA AD \n2023-0194), to address an unsafe condition on all Airbus Helicopters \nModel AS 332 C, AS 332 C1, AS 332 L, and AS 332 L1 helicopters. EASA AD \n2023-0194 stated that, following the loss of tightening torque of the \nattachment screws of the upper deck fittings of the three MGB \nsuspension bars and previous interim action, Airbus Helicopters \ndeveloped modification (mod) 0728496 (for helicopters with machined \nframes) and mod 0729200 (for helicopters with sheet metal frames), \nwhich improve the link of the fittings of the MGB suspension bars and \ninclude improved fitting screws. After EASA issued EASA AD 2023-0194, \nEASA superseded EASA AD 2023-0194 with EASA AD 2023-0194R1 Revision 1, \ndated March 19, 2025 (EASA AD 2023-0194R1) (also referred to as the \nMCAI). The MCAI states that since EASA AD 2023-0194 was issued, a new \nrisk analysis determined the calendar time compliance time for the \nmodification can be extended. The MCAI further states that EASA AD \n2023-0194R1 is considered to be an interim action. This condition, if \nnot addressed, could lead to structural failure of an MGB attachment \nassembly, detachment of an MGB suspension bar, and consequent loss of \ncontrol of the helicopter.\n    The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on \nthese products. You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at \n<a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under Docket No. FAA-2025-0910.\n\nMaterial Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51\n\n    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2023-0194R1, which specifies procedures \nfor determining the accumulated service life of the RH side and LH side \nrear fittings of the MGB suspension bars and repetitively replacing the \nRH side and LH side rear fittings and screws before exceeding \naccumulated service life limits. As an alternative to the first \nreplacement of the RH side rear fittings and screws, if certain \nconditions are met, EASA AD 2023-0194R1 allows measuring the tightening \ntorque, and depending on the measurement results, replacing affected \nparts with serviceable parts within extended compliance times. EASA AD \n2023-0194R1 also specifies procedures for replacing each MGB front \nfitting screw at the next major inspection (G) and modifying the \nhelicopter to improve the link of the fittings of the MGB suspension \nbar, which includes installing MGB fitting screws with an improved \ndesign. EASA AD 2023-0194R1 prohibits installing certain parts on any \nhelicopter. Finally, EASA AD 2023-0194R1 specifies procedures for a \nterminating action if the helicopter has been modified as defined in \nEASA AD 2023-0194R1 and provides credit for certain previously \naccomplished requirements.\n    This material is reasonably available because the interested \nparties have access to it through their normal course\n\n[[Page 22030]]\n\nof business or by the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.\n\nFAA's Determination\n\n    These products have been approved by the aviation authority of \nanother country and are approved for operation in the United States. \nPursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design \nAuthority, it has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition described in \nthe MCAI referenced above. The FAA is issuing this NPRM after \ndetermining that the unsafe condition described previously is likely to \nexist or develop on other products of the same type design.\n\nProposed AD Requirements in This NPRM\n\n    This proposed AD would retain none of the requirements of AD 2020-\n06-13. This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions \nspecified in EASA AD 2023-0194R1, described previously, as incorporated \nby reference, except for any differences identified as exceptions in \nthe regulatory text of this proposed AD. See ``Differences Between this \nAD and the MCAI'' for a discussion of the general differences included \nin this AD.\n\nExplanation of Required Compliance Information\n\n    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD \nprocess, the FAA developed a process to use some civil aviation \nauthority (CAA) ADs as the primary source of information for compliance \nwith requirements for corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been \ncoordinating this process with manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, the \nFAA proposes to incorporate EASA AD 2023-0194R1 by reference in the FAA \nfinal rule. This proposed AD would, therefore, require compliance with \nEASA AD 2023-0194R1 in its entirety through that incorporation, except \nfor any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of \nthis proposed AD. Using common terms that are the same as the heading \nof a particular section in EASA AD 2023-0194R1 does not mean that \noperators need comply only with that section. For example, where the AD \nrequirement refers to ``all required actions and compliance times,'' \ncompliance with this AD requirement is not limited to the section \ntitled ``Required Action(s) and Compliance Time(s)'' in EASA AD 2023-\n0194R1. Material referenced in EASA AD 2023-0194R1 for compliance will \nbe available at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under Docket No. FAA-2025-0910 after \nthe FAA final rule is published.\n\nDifferences Between This Proposed AD and the MCAI\n\n    Where the MCAI allows an option of an inspection of the torque \ninstead of replacement of the first MGB RH side rear fitting, which \nincludes different replacement compliance times based on the torque \ninspection results, this proposed AD would not.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\n    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would \naffect eight helicopters of U.S. registry. Labor rates are estimated at \n$85 per hour. Based on these numbers, the FAA estimates the following \ncosts to comply with this proposed AD.\n    Determining the total hours TIS of the rear MGB fittings would take \n0.5 work-hour for an estimated cost of $43 per helicopter and $344 for \nthe U.S. fleet.\n    Replacing a RH rear MGB fitting and its set of four bolts would \ntake 8 work-hours and parts would cost $3,589 for an estimated cost of \n$4,269 per helicopter and $34,152 for the U.S. fleet, per replacement \ncycle.\n    Replacing a set of four LH rear MGB fitting bolts would take 4 \nwork-hours and parts would cost $100 for an estimated cost of $440 per \nhelicopter and $3,520 for the U.S. fleet, per replacement cycle.\n    Replacing a LH rear MGB fitting would take 8 work-hours and parts \nwould cost $3,807 for an estimated cost of $4,487 per helicopter and \n$35,896 for the U.S. fleet, per replacement cycle.\n    Replacing a set of front MGB fitting bolts (4 bolts per set) would \ntake about 8 work-hours and parts would cost $98 for an estimated cost \nof $778 per helicopter and $6,224 for the U.S. fleet, per replacement \ncycle.\n    Modifying the MGB suspension bar (LH side and RH side) would take \n56 work-hours and parts would cost $115,509 for an estimated cost of \n$120,269 per helicopter.\n    The extent of corrective action that may needed if there is damage, \na crack, or insufficient clearance found while modifying the MGB \nsuspension bar could vary significantly from helicopter to helicopter. \nThe FAA has no way of determining the cost to correct or repair each \nhelicopter or the number of helicopters that may require repair.\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to \nissue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism \nimplications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not \nhave a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship \nbetween the national Government and the States, or on the distribution \nof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that the proposed \nregulation:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866,\n    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or \nnegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Proposed Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n\n\nSec.  39.13  [Amended]\n\n0\n2. The FAA amends Sec.  39.13 by:\n0\na. Removing Airworthiness Directive 2020-06-13, Amendment 39-19882 (85 \nFR 19080, April 6, 2020); and\n0\nb. Adding the following new airworthiness directive:\n\nAirbus Helicopters: Docket No. FAA-2025-0910; Project Identifier \nMCAI-2023-01167-R.\n\n[[Page 22031]]\n\n(a) Comments Due Date\n\n    The FAA must receive comments on this airworthiness directive \n(AD) by July 7, 2025.\n\n(b) Affected ADs\n\n    This AD replaces AD 2020-06-13, Amendment 39-19882 (85 FR 19080, \nApril 6, 2020).\n\n(c) Applicability\n\n    This AD applies to Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, \nAS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters, certificated in any category.\n\n(d) Subject\n\n    Joint Aircraft System Component (JASC) Code 6330, Main rotor \ntransmission mount.\n\n(e) Unsafe Condition\n\n    This AD was prompted by tests and analyses performed by the \nmanufacturer. The FAA is issuing this AD to prevent fatigue failure \nof the main gearbox (MGB) suspension bar attachment fittings and \nbolts by remaining in service beyond their fatigue life. The unsafe \ncondition, if not addressed, could result in failure of an MGB \nattachment assembly, detachment of an MGB suspension bar, and \nconsequent loss of control of the helicopter.\n\n(f) Compliance\n\n    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, \nunless already done.\n\n(g) Requirements\n\n    Except as specified in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this AD: Comply \nwith all required actions and compliance times specified in, and in \naccordance with, European Union Aviation Safety Agency AD 2023-\n0194R1, dated March 19, 2025 (EASA AD 2023-0194R1).\n\n    Note 1 to paragraph (g): EASA AD 2023-0194R1 and Airbus \nHelicopters material that is referenced in EASA AD 2023-0194R1 refer \nto MGB suspension bar attachment ``bolts'' as ``screws.''\n\n\n    Note 2 to paragraph (g): Table No. 1 of Airbus Helicopters Alert \nService Bulletin No. AS332-53.02.13, Revision 1, dated April 5, \n2024, identifies the helicopter group configurations referenced in \nEASA AD 2023-0194R1.\n\n(h) Exceptions to EASA AD 2023-0194R1\n\n    (1) Where EASA AD 2023-0194R1 requires compliance in terms of \nflight hours, this AD requires using hours time-in-service.\n    (2) Where EASA AD 2023-0194R1 refers to its effective date, \nDecember 17, 2018 (the effective date of EASA AD 2018-0260, dated \nDecember 3, 2018), or November 22, 2023 (the effective date of EASA \nAD 2023-0194, dated November 8, 2023), this AD requires using the \neffective date of this AD.\n    (3) Where the material referenced in EASA AD 2023-0194R1 \nspecifies discarding parts, this AD requires removing those parts \nfrom service.\n    (4) This AD does not adopt paragraphs (3) through (5) of EASA AD \n2023-0194R1.\n    (5) Where paragraphs (2) and (6) of EASA AD 2023-0194R1 state \n``paragraph 3.B.3,'' this AD requires replacing that text with \n``paragraphs 3.B.2. and 3.B.3.''\n    (6) Where the modification ASB, as defined and referenced in \nEASA AD 2023-0194R1, specifies contacting Airbus Helicopters \nTechnical Support if there is visible damage, a crack, or \ninsufficient clearance after replacing hardware, this AD requires, \nbefore further flight, accomplishing further action in accordance \nwith a method approved by the Manager, International Validation \nBranch, FAA; EASA; or Airbus Helicopters' EASA Design Organization \nApproval (DOA). If approved by the DOA, the approval must include \nthe DOA-authorized signature.\n    (7) Where the modification ASB, as defined and referenced in \nEASA AD 2023-0194R1, specifies to keep parts after removing, for \nthis AD, keeping these parts is not required.\n    (8) Where the modification ASB, as defined and referenced in \nEASA AD 2023-0194R1, specifies repairing X3855 frame drilling kit \n(also identified as a Guide having part number X530P8102101 and \nreferred to as Item ``zz''), this AD prohibits using X3855 frame \ndrilling kit for the actions required by this AD if there is any \ndamage that consists of cracks, corrosion, lengthening or \ndeformation of the rods or arms, or excessive wear.\n    (9) Sections 11 through 14 in Appendix 4.A. of the modification \nASB, as defined and referenced in EASA AD 2023-0194R1, are not \nrequired by this AD.\n    (10) This AD does not adopt the Remarks section of EASA AD 2023-\n0194R1.\n\n(i) No Reporting Requirement\n\n    Although the material referenced in EASA AD 2023-0194R1 \nspecifies to submit information to the manufacturer, this AD does \nnot require these actions.\n\n(j) Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs)\n\n    (1) The Manager, International Validation Branch, FAA, has the \nauthority to approve AMOCs for this AD, if requested using the \nprocedures found in 14 CFR 39.19.

Subtitle I, Section 106, \ndescribes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, \nAviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's \nauthority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described \nin Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, \nthe FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of \nairspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient \nuse of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority, \nas it would amend Class D, amend Class E4, and amend Class E5 airspace \nin Nantucket, MA.\n\nComments Invited\n\n    The FAA invites interested persons to participate in this \nrulemaking by submitting written comments, data, or views. Comments are \nspecifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, \nenvironmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal. The most \nhelpful comments reference a specific portion of the proposal, explain \nthe reason for any recommended change, and include supporting data. To \nensure the docket does not contain duplicate comments, commenters \nshould submit only one time if comments are filed electronically, or \ncommenters should send only one copy of written comments if comments \nare filed in writing.\n    The FAA will file in the docket all comments it receives, as well \nas a report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA \npersonnel concerning this proposed rulemaking. Before acting on this \nproposal, the FAA will consider all thecomments it receives on or \nbefore the closing date for comments. The FAA will consider comments \nfiled after the comment period has closed if it is possible to do so \nwithout incurring expense or delay. The FAA may change this proposal in \nlight of the comments it receives.\n    Privacy: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments \nfrom the public to better inform its rulemaking process.

An informal docket may also be examined during \nregular business hours at the office of the Eastern Service Center, \nFederal Aviation Administration, Room 210, 1701 Columbia Ave., College \nPark, GA 30337.\n\nIncorporation by Reference\n\n    Class D and Class E airspace designations are published in \nparagraphs 5000, 6004, and 6005 of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace \nDesignations and Reporting Points, which is incorporated by reference \nin 14 CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This document proposes to amend the \ncurrent version of that order, FAA Order JO 7400.11J, dated July 31, \n2024, and effective September 15, 2024. These updates would be \npublished in the next update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA Order JO \n7400.11J, which lists Class A, B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air \ntraffic service routes, and reporting points, is publicly available as \nlisted in the ADDRESSES section of this document.\n\nThe Proposal\n\n    This action proposes an amendment to 14 CFR part 71 to amend the \nClass D, E4, and E5 airspace for Nantucket Memorial Airport, Nantucket, \nMA. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of \nIFR operations in the area for existing instrument approach procedures.\n    This action proposes to amend the Class D airspace extending upward \nfrom the surface to and including 2,500 feet MSL for Nantucket Memorial \nAirport, Nantucket, MA, by increasing it to a 4.4-mile radius excluding \nthat airspace within a .3 mile radius of Waine Heliport, Nantucket, MA, \nas the current radius of 4.2-miles does not properly contain instrument \nflight rules operations. This will also update the geographic \ncoordinates for the Nantucket Memorial Airport in the Class D legal \ndescription.\n    This action also proposes to amend the Class E4 airspace over \nNantucket, MA, by reducing its size to the new dimensions of 1.4 miles \neither side of the 044[deg] bearing from the Nantucket Memorial Airport \nextending from the 4.4 mile radius to 9.4 miles Northeast of the \nairport. This will also update the geographic coordinates for the \nNantucket Memorial Airport in the Class E4 legal description.\n\n[[Page 22033]]\n\n    This action also proposes to amend Class E5 airspace extending from \n700 feet above the surface by changing the dimensions to be within a \n6.9-mile radius of Nantucket Memorial Airport and within 2.4 miles each \nside of the 044[deg] bearing from the Nantucket Memorial Airport 6.9-\nmile radius to 9.4 miles northeast of the Airport. This will also \nupdate the geographic coordinates for the Nantucket Memorial Airport \nand remove the reference to the Nantucket VORTAC in the Class E5 legal \ndescription. This reconfiguration will properly contain the currently \npublished standard instrument approach procedures.\n    This action will also make an editorial change to the Nantucket, \nMA, Class D, E4 and E5 airspace descriptions to replace ``Airport/\nFacility Directory'' with ``Chart Supplement'' in accordance with \ncurrent FAA policy.\n\nRegulatory Notices and Analyses\n\n    The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves \nan established body of technical regulations for which frequent and \nroutine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. \nIt, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under \nExecutive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) Regulatory Policies and Procedures \n(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation \nof a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. \nSince this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic \nprocedures and air navigation, it is certified that this proposed rule, \nwhen promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities under the criteria of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nEnvironmental Review\n\n    This proposal will be subject to an environmental analysis in \naccordance with FAA Order 1050.1F, ``Environmental Impacts: Policies \nand Procedures,'' prior to any final regulatory action by the FAA.\n\nLists of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71\n\n    Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).\n\nThe Proposed Amendment\n\n    In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows:\n\nPART 71--DESIGNATION OF CLASS A, B, C, D, AND E AIRSPACE AREAS; AIR \nTRAFFIC SERVICE ROUTES; AND REPORTING POINTS\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 71 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 106(f), 106(g), 40103, 40113, 40120; E.O. \n10854, 24 FR 9565, 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 389.\n\n\nSec.  71.1  [Amended]\n\n0\n2. The incorporation by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 of FAA Order JO \n7400.11J, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated July 31, \n2024, and effective September 15, 2024, is amended as follows:\n\nParagraph 5000 Class D Airspace.\n\n* * * * *\n\nANE MA D Nantucket, MA [Amended]\n\nNantucket Memorial Airport, MA\n    (Lat. 41[deg]15'12'' N, long. 70[deg]03'38'' W)\nWaine Heliport, MA\n    (Lat. 41[deg]17'06'' N, long. 70[deg]08'59'' W)\n\n    That airspace extending upward from the surface to and including \n2,500 feet MSL within a 4.4-mile radius of Nantucket Memorial \nAirport excluding that airspace within a .3 mile radius of Waine \nHeliport.

What action is the EPA proposing?\n\n    On July 1, 2024, the Vermont Department of Environmental \nConservation (VT DEC) submitted a revision to its SIP to address \nregional haze for the second implementation period. VT DEC made this \nSIP submission to satisfy the requirements of the CAA's regional haze \nprogram pursuant to CAA sections 169A and 169B and 40 CFR 51.308. The \nEPA is proposing to find that the Vermont regional haze SIP submission \nfor the second implementation period meets the applicable statutory and \nregulatory requirements and thus proposes to approve Vermont's \nsubmission into its SIP.\n\nII. Background and Requirements for Regional Haze Plans\n\n    A detailed history and background of the regional haze program is \nprovided in multiple prior EPA proposal actions.\\1\\ For additional \nbackground on the 2017 RHR revisions, please refer to Section III. \nOverview of Visibility Protection Statutory Authority, Regulation, and \nImplementation of ``Protection of Visibility: Amendments to \nRequirements for State Plans'' of the 2017 RHR.\\2\\ The following is an \nabbreviated history and background of the regional haze program and \n2017 Regional Haze Rule as it applies to the current action.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See 90 FR 13516 (March 24, 2025).\n    \\2\\ See 82 FR 3078 (January 10, 2017).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. Regional Haze Background\n\n    In the 1977 CAA Amendments, Congress created a program for \nprotecting visibility in the nation's mandatory Class I Federal areas, \nwhich include certain national parks and wilderness areas.\\3\\ CAA 169A. \nThe CAA establishes as a national goal the ``prevention of any future, \nand the remedying of any existing, impairment of visibility in \nmandatory class I Federal areas which impairment results from manmade \nair pollution.'' CAA 169A(a)(1). Regional haze is visibility impairment \nthat is produced by a multitude of anthropogenic sources and activities \nwhich are located across a broad geographic area and that emit \npollutants that impair visibility. Visibility impairing pollutants \ninclude fine and coarse particulate matter (PM) (e.g., sulfates, \nnitrates, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and soil dust) and their \nprecursors (e.g., sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), nitrogen oxides \n(NO<INF>X</INF>), and, in some cases, volatile organic compounds (VOC) \nand ammonia (NH3)). Fine particle precursors react in the atmosphere to \nform fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>), which impairs \nvisibility by scattering and absorbing light. Visibility impairment \nreduces the perception of clarity and color, as well as visible \ndistance.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ Areas statutorily designated as mandatory Class I Federal \nareas consist of national parks exceeding 6,000 acres, wilderness \nareas and national memorial parks exceeding 5,000 acres, and all \ninternational parks that were in existence on August 7, 1977. CAA \n162(a). There are 156 mandatory Class I areas. The list of areas to \nwhich the requirements of the visibility protection program apply is \nin 40 CFR part 81, subpart D.\n    \\4\\ There are several ways to measure the amount of visibility \nimpairment, i.e., haze. One such measurement is the deciview, which \nis the principal metric used by the RHR. Under many circumstances, a \nchange in one deciview will be perceived by the human eye to be the \nsame on both clear and hazy days. The deciview is unitless. It is \nproportional to the logarithm of the atmospheric extinction of \nlight, which is the perceived dimming of light due to its being \nscattered and absorbed as it passes through the atmosphere. \nAtmospheric light extinction (b\\ext\\) is a metric used to for \nexpressing visibility and is measured in inverse megameters \n(Mm<SUP>-1</SUP>). The formula for the deciview is 10 ln \n(b<SUP>ext</SUP>)/10 Mm<SUP>-1</SUP>). 40 CFR 51.301.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    To address regional haze visibility impairment, the 1999 RHR \nestablished an iterative planning process that requires both states in \nwhich Class I areas are located and states ``the emissions from which \nmay reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment \nof visibility'' in a Class I area to periodically submit SIP revisions \nto address such impairment. CAA 169A(b)(2); \\5\\ see also 40 CFR \n51.308(b), (f) (establishing submission dates for iterative regional \nhaze SIP revisions); 64 FR at 35768 (July 1, 1999).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ The RHR expresses the statutory requirement for states to \nsubmit plans addressing out-of-state class I areas by providing that \nstates must address visibility impairment ``in each mandatory Class \nI Federal area located outside the State that may be affected by \nemissions from within the State.'' 40 CFR 51.308(d), (f).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 22035]]\n\n    On January 10, 2017, the EPA promulgated revisions to the RHR, 82 \nFR 3078 (January 10, 2017), that apply for the second and subsequent \nimplementation periods. The reasonable progress requirements as revised \nin the 2017 rulemaking (referred to here as the 2017 RHR Revisions) are \ncodified at 40 CFR 51.308(f).\n\nB. Roles of Agencies in Addressing Regional Haze\n\n    Because the air pollutants and pollution affecting visibility in \nClass I areas can be transported over long distances, successful \nimplementation of the regional haze program requires long-term, \nregional coordination among multiple jurisdictions and agencies that \nhave responsibility for Class I areas and the emissions that impact \nvisibility in those areas. In order to address regional haze, states \nneed to develop strategies in coordination with one another, \nconsidering the effect of emissions from one jurisdiction on the air \nquality in another. Five regional planning organizations (RPOs), which \ninclude representation from state and tribal governments, the EPA, and \nFLMs, were developed in the lead-up to the first implementation period \nto address regional haze. RPOs evaluate technical information to better \nunderstand how emissions from State and Tribal land impact Class I \nareas across the country, pursue the development of regional strategies \nto reduce emissions of particulate matter and other pollutants leading \nto regional haze, and help states meet the consultation requirements of \nthe RHR.\n    The Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Visibility Union (MANEVU), one of the \nfive RPOs described above, is a collaborative effort of state \ngovernments, tribal governments, and various Federal agencies \nestablished to initiate and coordinate activities associated with the \nmanagement of regional haze, visibility, and other air quality issues \nin the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast corridor of the United States. Member \nstates and tribal governments (listed alphabetically) include: \nConnecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, \nPenobscot Indian Nation, Rhode Island, St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, and \nVermont. The Federal partner members of MANEVU are EPA, U.S. National \nParks Service (NPS), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and U.S. \nForest Service (USFS).\n\nIII. Requirements for Regional Haze Plans for the Second Implementation \nPeriod\n\n    Under the CAA and EPA's regulations, all 50 states, the District of \nColumbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are required to submit regional \nhaze SIPs satisfying the applicable requirements for the second \nimplementation period of the regional haze program by July 31, 2021. \nEach state's SIP must contain a long-term strategy for making \nreasonable progress toward meeting the national goal of remedying any \nexisting and preventing any future anthropogenic visibility impairment \nin Class I areas. CAA 169A(b)(2)(B). To this end, 40 CFR 51.308(f) lays \nout the process by which states determine what constitutes their long-\nterm strategies, with the order of the requirements in 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(1) through (f)(3) generally mirroring the order of the steps \nin the reasonable progress analysis \\6\\ and (f)(4) through (f)(6) \ncontaining additional, related requirements. Broadly speaking, a state \nfirst must identify the Class I areas within the state and determine \nthe Class I areas outside the state in which visibility may be affected \nby emissions from the state. These are the Class I areas that must be \naddressed in the state's long-term strategy. See 40 CFR 51.308(f), \n(f)(2). For each Class I area within its borders, a state must then \ncalculate the baseline (five-year average period of 2000-2004), \ncurrent, and natural visibility conditions (i.e., visibility conditions \nwithout anthropogenic visibility impairment) for that area, as well as \nthe visibility improvement made to date and the ``uniform rate of \nprogress'' (URP). The URP is the linear rate of progress needed to \nattain natural visibility conditions, assuming a starting point of \nbaseline visibility conditions in 2004 and ending with natural \nconditions in 2064. This linear interpolation is used as a tracking \nmetric to help states assess the amount of progress they are making \ntowards the national visibility goal over time in each Class I area. \nSee 40 CFR 51.308(f)(1). Each state having a Class I area and/or \nemissions that may affect visibility in a Class I area must then \ndevelop a long-term strategy that includes the enforceable emission \nlimitations, compliance schedules, and other measures that are \nnecessary to make reasonable progress in such areas. A reasonable \nprogress determination is based on applying the four factors in CAA \nsection 169A(g)(1) to sources of visibility-impairing pollutants that \nthe state has selected to assess for controls for the second \nimplementation period. See 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2). Additionally, as \nfurther explained below, the RHR at 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iv) separately \nprovides five ``additional factors'' \\7\\ that states must consider in \ndeveloping their long-term strategies. A state evaluates potential \nemission reduction measures for those selected sources and determines \nwhich are necessary to make reasonable progress. Those measures are \nthen incorporated into the state's long-term strategy. After a state \nhas developed its long-term strategy, it then establishes RPGs for each \nClass I area within its borders by modeling the visibility impacts of \nall reasonable progress controls at the end of the second \nimplementation period, i.e., in 2028, as well as the impacts of other \nrequirements of the CAA. The RPGs include reasonable progress controls \nnot only for sources in the state in which the Class I area is located, \nbut also for sources in other states that contribute to visibility \nimpairment in that area. The RPGs are then compared to the baseline \nvisibility conditions and the URP to ensure that progress is being made \ntowards the statutory goal of preventing any future and remedying any \nexisting anthropogenic visibility impairment in Class I areas. 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)-(3). There are additional requirements in the rule, \nincluding FLM consultation, that apply to all visibility protection \nSIPs and SIP revisions. See e.g., 40 CFR 51.308(i).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ EPA explained in the 2017 RHR Revisions that we were \nadopting new regulatory language in 40 CFR 51.308(f) that, unlike \nthe structure in 51.308(d), ``tracked the actual planning \nsequence.'' 82 FR 3091 (January 10, 2017).\n    \\7\\ The five ``additional factors'' for consideration in section \n51.308(f)(2)(iv) are distinct from the four factors listed in CAA \nsection 169A(g)(1) and 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) that states must \nconsider and apply to sources in determining reasonable progress.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. Long-Term Strategy for Regional Haze\n\n    While states have discretion to choose any source selection \nmethodology that is reasonable, whatever choices they make should be \nreasonably explained. To this end, 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) requires that \na state's SIP submission include ``a description of the criteria it \nused to determine which sources or groups of sources it evaluated.'' \nThe technical basis for source selection, which may include methods for \nquantifying potential visibility impacts such as emissions divided by \ndistance metrics, trajectory analyses, residence time analyses, and/or \nphotochemical modeling, must also be appropriately documented, as \nrequired by 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iii).\n\n[[Page 22036]]\n\n    Once a state has selected the set of sources, the next step is to \ndetermine the emissions reduction measures for those sources that are \nnecessary to make reasonable progress for the second implementation \nperiod.\\8\\ This is accomplished by considering the four factors--``the \ncosts of compliance, the time necessary for compliance, and the energy \nand nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, and the \nremaining useful life of any existing source subject to such \nrequirements.'' CAA 169A(g)(1). The EPA has explained that the four-\nfactor analysis is an assessment of potential emission reduction \nmeasures (i.e., control options) for sources; ``use of the terms \n`compliance' and `subject to such requirements' in section 169A(g)(1) \ncan be read that Congress intended the relevant determination to be the \nrequirements with which sources would have to comply in order to \nsatisfy the CAA's reasonable progress mandate.'' 82 FR at 3091. Thus, \nfor each source it has selected for four-factor analysis,\\9\\ a state \nmust consider a ``meaningful set'' of technically feasible control \noptions for reducing emissions of visibility impairing pollutants. Id. \nat 3088.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ The CAA provides that, ``[i]n determining reasonable \nprogress there shall be taken into consideration'' the four \nstatutory factors. CAA 169A(g)(1). However, in addition to four-\nfactor analyses for selected sources, groups of sources, or source \ncategories, a state may also consider additional emission reduction \nmeasures for inclusion in its long-term strategy, e.g., from other \nnewly adopted, on-the-books, or on-the-way rules and measures for \nsources not selected for four-factor analysis for the second \nplanning period.\n    \\9\\ ``Each source'' or ``particular source'' is used here as \nshorthand. While a source-specific analysis is one way of applying \nthe four factors, neither the statute nor the RHR requires states to \nevaluate individual sources. Rather, states have ``the flexibility \nto conduct four-factor analyses for specific sources, groups of \nsources or even entire source categories, depending on state policy \npreferences and the specific circumstances of each state.'' 82 FR at \n3088.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The EPA has also explained that, in addition to the four statutory \nfactors, states have flexibility under the CAA and RHR to reasonably \nconsider visibility benefits as an additional factor alongside the four \nstatutory factors.\\10\\ Ultimately, while states have discretion to \nreasonably weigh the factors and to determine what level of control is \nneeded, 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) provides that a state ``must include in \nits implementation plan a description of . . . how the four factors \nwere taken into consideration in selecting the measure for inclusion in \nits long-term strategy.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See, e.g., Responses to Comments on Protection of \nVisibility: Amendments to Requirements for State Plans; Proposed \nRule (81 FR 26942, May 4, 2016), Docket Number EPA-HQ-OAR-2015-0531, \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 186.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As explained above, 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) requires states to \ndetermine the emission reduction measures for sources that are \nnecessary to make reasonable progress by considering the four factors. \nPursuant to 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2), measures that are necessary to make \nreasonable progress towards the national visibility goal must be \nincluded in a state's long-term strategy and in its SIP.\\11\\ If the \noutcome of a four-factor analysis is that an emissions reduction \nmeasure is necessary to make reasonable progress towards remedying \nexisting or preventing future anthropogenic visibility impairment, that \nmeasure must be included in the SIP.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ States may choose to, but are not required to, include \nmeasures in their long-term strategies beyond just the emission \nreduction measures that are necessary for reasonable progress. For \nexample, states with smoke management programs may choose to submit \ntheir smoke management plans to EPA for inclusion in their SIPs but \nare not required to do so. See, e.g., 82 FR at 3108-09 (requirement \nto consider smoke management practices and smoke management programs \nunder 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iv) does not require states to adopt such \npractices or programs into their SIPs, although they may elect to do \nso).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The characterization of information on each of the factors is also \nsubject to the documentation requirement in 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iii). \nThe reasonable progress analysis is a technically complex exercise, and \nalso a flexible one that provides states with bounded discretion to \ndesign and implement approaches appropriate to their circumstances. \nGiven this flexibility, 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iii) plays an important \nfunction in requiring a state to document the technical basis for its \ndecision making so that the public and the EPA can comprehend and \nevaluate the information and analysis the state relied upon to \ndetermine what emission reduction measures must be in place to make \nreasonable progress. The technical documentation must include the \nmodeling, monitoring, cost, engineering, and emissions information on \nwhich the state relied to determine the measures necessary to make \nreasonable progress.\n    Additionally, the RHR at 40 CFR 51.3108(f)(2)(iv) separately \nprovides five ``additional factors'' \\12\\ that states must consider in \ndeveloping their long-term strategies: (1) Emission reductions due to \nongoing air pollution control programs, including measures to address \nreasonably attributable visibility impairment; (2) measures to reduce \nthe impacts of construction activities; (3) source retirement and \nreplacement schedules; (4) basic smoke management practices for \nprescribed fire used for agricultural and wildland vegetation \nmanagement purposes and smoke management programs; and (5) the \nanticipated net effect on visibility due to projected changes in point, \narea, and mobile source emissions over the period addressed by the \nlong-term strategy.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ The five ``additional factors'' for consideration in \nsection 51.308(f)(2)(iv) are distinct from the four factors listed \nin CAA section 169A(g)(1) and 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) that states \nmust consider and apply to sources in determining reasonable \nprogress.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Because the air pollution that causes regional haze crosses state \nboundaries, 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(ii) requires a state to consult with \nother states that also have emissions that are reasonably anticipated \nto contribute to visibility impairment in a given Class I area. If a \nstate, pursuant to consultation, agrees that certain measures (e.g., a \ncertain emission limitation) are necessary to make reasonable progress \nat a Class I area, it must include those measures in its SIP. 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)(ii)(A). Additionally, the RHR requires that states that \ncontribute to visibility impairment at the same Class I area consider \nthe emission reduction measures the other contributing states have \nidentified as being necessary to make reasonable progress for their own \nsources. 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(ii)(B). If a state has been asked to \nconsider or adopt certain emission reduction measures, but ultimately \ndetermines those measures are not necessary to make reasonable \nprogress, that state must document in its SIP the actions taken to \nresolve the disagreement. 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(ii)(C). Under all \ncircumstances, a state must document in its SIP submission all \nsubstantive consultations with other contributing states. 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)(ii)(C).\n\nB. Reasonable Progress Goals\n\n    Reasonable progress goals ``measure the progress that is projected \nto be achieved by the control measures states have determined are \nnecessary to make reasonable progress based on a four-factor \nanalysis.'' 82 FR at 3091. For the second implementation period, the \nRPGs are set for 2028. Reasonable progress goals are not enforceable \ntargets. 40 CFR 51.308(f)(3)(iii). While states are not legally \nobligated to achieve the visibility conditions described in their RPGs, \n40 CFR 51.308(f)(3)(i) requires that ``[t]he long-term strategy and the \nreasonable progress goals must provide for an improvement in visibility \nfor the most impaired days since the baseline period and ensure no \ndegradation in visibility for the clearest days since the baseline \nperiod.''\n    RPGs may also serve as a metric for assessing the amount of \nprogress a state\n\n[[Page 22037]]\n\nis making towards the national visibility goal. To support this \napproach, the RHR requires states with Class I areas to compare the \n2028 RPG for the most impaired days to the corresponding point on the \nURP line (representing visibility conditions in 2028 if visibility were \nto improve at a linear rate from conditions in the baseline period of \n2000-2004 to natural visibility conditions in 2064). If the most \nimpaired days RPG in 2028 is above the URP line (i.e., if visibility \nconditions are improving more slowly than the rate described by the URP \nline), each state that contributes to visibility impairment in the \nClass I area must demonstrate, based on the four-factor analysis \nrequired under 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i), that no additional emission \nreduction measures would be reasonable to include in its long-term \nstrategy. 40 CFR 51.308(f)(3)(ii). To this end, 40 CFR 51.308(f)(3)(ii) \nrequires that each state contributing to visibility impairment in a \nClass I area that is projected to improve more slowly than the URP \nprovide ``a robust demonstration, including documenting the criteria \nused to determine which sources or groups [of] sources were evaluated \nand how the four factors required by paragraph (f)(2)(i) were taken \ninto consideration in selecting the measures for inclusion in its long-\nterm strategy.''\n\nC. Monitoring Strategy and Other State Implementation Plan Requirements\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(6) requires states to have certain strategies and \nelements in place for assessing and reporting on visibility. Individual \nrequirements under this subsection apply either to states with Class I \nareas within their borders, states with no Class I areas but that are \nreasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment \nin any Class I area, or both. Compliance with the monitoring strategy \nrequirement may be met through a state's participation in the \nInteragency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) \nmonitoring network, which is used to measure visibility impairment \ncaused by air pollution at the 156 Class I areas covered by the \nvisibility program. 40 CFR 51.308(f)(6), (f)(6)(i), (f)(6)(iv).\n    All states' SIPs must provide for procedures by which monitoring \ndata and other information are used to determine the contribution of \nemissions from within the state to regional haze visibility impairment \nin affected Class I areas, as well as a statewide inventory documenting \nsuch emissions. 40 CFR 51.308(f)(6)(ii), (iii), (v). All states' SIPs \nmust also provide for any other elements, including reporting, \nrecordkeeping, and other measures, that are necessary for states to \nassess and report on visibility. 40 CFR 51.308(f)(6)(vi).\n\nD. Requirements for Periodic Reports Describing Progress Towards the \nReasonable Progress Goals\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(5) requires a state's regional haze SIP revision \nto address the requirements of paragraphs 40 CFR 51.308(g)(1) through \n(5) so that the plan revision due in 2021 will serve also as a progress \nreport addressing the period since submission of the progress report \nfor the first implementation period. The regional haze progress report \nrequirement is designed to inform the public and the EPA about a \nstate's implementation of its existing long-term strategy and whether \nsuch implementation is in fact resulting in the expected visibility \nimprovement. See 81 FR 26942, 26950 (May 4, 2016); 82 FR at 3119 \n(January 10, 2017). To this end, every state's SIP revision for the \nsecond implementation period is required to assess changes in \nvisibility and describe the status of implementation of all measures \nincluded in the state's long-term strategy, including BART and \nreasonable progress emission reduction measures from the first \nimplementation period, and the resulting emissions reductions. 40 CFR \n51.308(g)(1) and (2).\n\nE. Requirements for State and Federal Land Manager Coordination\n\n    Clean Air Act section 169A(d) requires that before a state holds a \npublic hearing on a proposed regional haze SIP revision, it must \nconsult with the appropriate FLM or FLMs; pursuant to that \nconsultation, the state must include a summary of the FLMs' conclusions \nand recommendations in the notice to the public. Consistent with this \nstatutory requirement, the RHR also requires that states ``provide the \n[FLM] with an opportunity for consultation, in person and at a point \nearly enough in the State's policy analyses of its long-term strategy \nemission reduction obligation so that information and recommendations \nprovided by the [FLM] can meaningfully inform the State's decisions on \nthe long-term strategy.'' 40 CFR 51.308(i)(2). For the EPA to evaluate \nwhether FLM consultation meeting the requirements of the RHR has \noccurred, the SIP submission should include documentation of the timing \nand content of such consultation. The SIP revision submitted to the EPA \nmust also describe how the state addressed any comments provided by the \nFLMs. 40 CFR 51.308(i)(3). Finally, a SIP revision must provide \nprocedures for continuing consultation between the state and FLMs \nregarding the state's visibility protection program, including \ndevelopment and review of SIP revisions, five-year progress reports, \nand the implementation of other programs having the potential to \ncontribute to impairment of visibility in Class I areas. 40 CFR \n51.308(i)(4).\n\nIV. The EPA's Evaluation of Vermont's Regional Haze Submission for the \nSecond Implementation Period\n\nA. Background on Vermont's First Implementation Period SIP Submission\n\n    VT DEC submitted its first implementation period regional haze SIP \nto the EPA on August 31, 2009, with a supplemental submittal on January \n3, 2012. The EPA approved Vermont's first implementation period \nregional haze SIP submission on May 22, 2012. 77 FR 30212. EPA's \napproval included, but was not limited to, the portions of the plan \nthat address the reasonable progress requirements such as Vermont's \nimplementation of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) on \neligible sources, Vermont's maintenance of non-EGU point source \ncontrols, as well as Vermont's low sulfur fuel program, Section 5-221 \nof the VT SIP, ``Prohibition of Potentially Polluting Materials in \nFuel.'' Pursuant to 40 CFR 51.308(g), Vermont was also responsible for \nsubmitting a five-year progress report as a SIP revision for the first \nimplementation period, which it did on February 29, 2016. The EPA \napproved the progress report into the Vermont SIP on December 18, 2017. \n82 FR 59969.\n\nB. Vermont's Second Implementation Period SIP Submission and the EPA's \nEvaluation\n\n    In accordance with CAA section 169A and the RHR at 40 CFR \n51.308(f), on July 3, 2024, VT DEC submitted a revision to the Vermont \nSIP to address its regional haze obligations for the second \nimplementation period, which runs through 2028. A draft of Vermont's \nRegional Haze SIP submission was available for public comment on April \n18, 2024, until June 1, 2024. A public hearing was also held on May 22, \n2024. VT DEC only received comments from EPA, which are included in the \nSIP submission.\n    The following sections describe Vermont's SIP submission, including \nanalyses conducted by MANEVU and Vermont's determinations based on \nthose analyses, Vermont's assessment of progress made since the first \nimplementation period in reducing\n\n[[Page 22038]]\n\nemissions of visibility impairing pollutants, and improvements to \nvisibility at its Class I area and nearby Class I areas in other \nstates. This notice also contains EPA's evaluation of Vermont's \nsubmission against the requirements of the CAA and RHR for the second \nimplementation period of the regional haze program.\n\nC. Identification of Class I Areas\n\n    Section 169A(b)(2) of the CAA requires each state in which any \nClass I area is located or ``the emissions from which may reasonably be \nanticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility'' in \na Class I area to have a plan for making reasonable progress toward the \nnational visibility goal. The RHR implements this statutory requirement \nat 40 CFR 51.308(f), which provides that each state's plan ``must \naddress regional haze in each mandatory Class I Federal area located \nwithin the State and in each mandatory Class I Federal area located \noutside the State that may be affected by emissions within the State,'' \nand (f)(2), which requires each state's plan to include a long-term \nstrategy that addresses regional haze in such Class I areas.\n    Vermont has one mandatory Class I Federal area within its borders, \nthe Lye Brook Wilderness area. Visibility monitoring in this area is \naccomplished with instruments located at a single site at Mount Snow in \nWest Dover, Vermont. This monitoring station represents the Class I \nwilderness area. For the second implementation period, MANEVU performed \ntechnical analyses \\13\\ to help assess source and state-level \ncontributions to visibility impairment and the need for interstate \nconsultation. MANEVU used the results of these analyses to determine \nwhich states' emissions ``have a high likelihood of affecting \nvisibility in MANEVU's Class I areas.'' \\14\\ Similar to metrics used in \nthe first implementation period,\\15\\ MANEVU used a greater than 2 \npercent of sulfate plus nitrate emissions contribution criterion to \ndetermine whether emissions from individual jurisdictions within the \nregion affected visibility in any Class I areas. The MANEVU analyses \nfor the second implementation period used a combination of data \nanalysis techniques, including emissions data, distance from Class I \nareas, wind trajectories, and CALPUFF dispersion modeling. Although \nmany of the analyses focused only on SO<INF>2</INF> emissions and \nresultant particulate sulfate contributions to visibility impairment, \nsome also incorporated NO<INF>X</INF> emissions to estimate particulate \nnitrate contributions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\13\\ The contribution assessment methodologies for MANEVU Class \nI areas are summarized in appendix E of the docket. ``Selection of \nStates for MANEVU Regional Haze Consultation (2018)''\n    \\14\\ Id.\n    \\15\\ MANEVU supporting materials can be found in the docket of \nthis proposed rulemaking.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    One MANEVU analysis used for contribution assessment was CALPUFF \nair dispersion modeling. The CALPUFF model was used to estimate sulfate \nand nitrate formation and transport in MANEVU and nearby regions \noriginating from large electric generating unit (EGU) point sources and \nother large industrial and institutional sources in the eastern and \ncentral United States. Information from an initial round of CALPUFF \nmodeling was collated for the 444 EGUs that were determined to warrant \nfurther scrutiny based on their emissions of SO<INF>2</INF> and \nNO<INF>X</INF>. The list of EGUs was based on an enhanced ``Q/d'' \nanalysis \\16\\ that considered recent SO<INF>2</INF> emissions in the \neastern United States and an analysis that adjusted previous 2002 \nMANEVU CALPUFF modeling by applying a ratio of 2011 to 2002 \nSO<INF>2</INF> emissions. This list of sources was then enhanced by \nincluding the top five SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> emission \nsources for 2011 for each state included in the modeling domain. A \ntotal of 311 EGU stacks (as opposed to individual units) were included \nin the CALPUFF modeling analysis. Initial information was also \ncollected on the 50 industrial and institutional sources that, \naccording to 2011 Q/d analysis, contributed the most to visibility \nimpact in each Class I area. The ultimate CALPUFF modeling run included \na total of 311 EGU stacks and 82 industrial facilities. The summary \nreport for the CALPUFF modeling included the top 10 most impacting EGUs \nand the top 5 most impacting industrial/institutional sources for each \nClass I area and compiled those results into a ranked list of the most \nimpacting EGUs and industrial sources at MANEVU Class I areas.\\17\\ \nOverall, MANEVU found that emission sources located close to Class I \nareas typically show higher visibility impacts than similarly sized \nfacilities further away. However, visibility degradation appears to be \ndominated by the more distant emission sources due to their larger \nemissions. The CALPUFF modeling did not include any individual EGU or \nindustrial/institutional point sources in Vermont because the state's \nSO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions were much lower than the \nother regional sources considered in the CALPUFF modeling analysis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ ``Q/d'' is emissions (Q) in tons per year, typically of one \nor a combination of visibility-impairing pollutants, divided by \ndistance to a class I area (d) in kilometers. The resulting ratio is \ncommonly used as a metric to assess a source's potential visibility \nimpacts on a particular class I area.\n    \\17\\ See appendix C in the Docket, ``2016 MANEVU Source \nContribution Modeling Report, CALPUFF Modeling of Large Electrical \nGenerating Units and Industrial Sources'' and Appendix D ``MANEVU \nUpdated Q/d*C Contribution Assessment.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The second MANEVU contribution analysis used a meteorologically \nweighted Q/d calculation to assess states' contributions to visibility \nimpairment at MANEVU Class I areas.\\18\\ This analysis focused \npredominantly on SO<INF>2</INF> emissions and used cumulative \nSO<INF>2</INF> emissions from a source and a state for the variable \n``Q,'' and the distance of the source or state to the IMPROVE monitor \nreceptor at a Class I area as ``d.'' The result is then multiplied by a \nconstant (C<INF>i</INF>), which is determined based on the prevailing \nwind patterns. MANEVU selected a meteorologically weighted Q/d analysis \nas an inexpensive initial screening tool that could easily be repeated \nto determine which states, sectors, or sources have a larger relative \nimpact and warrant further analysis. Although MANEVU did not originally \nestimate nitrate impacts, the MANEVU Q/d analysis was subsequently \nextended to account for nitrate contributions from NO<INF>X</INF> \nemissions and to approximate the nitrate impacts from area and mobile \nsources. MANEVU therefore developed a ratio of nitrate to sulfate \nimpacts based on the previously described CALPUFF modeling and applied \nthose to the sulfate Q/d results in order to derive nitrate \ncontribution estimates. Several states, such as Vermont, did not have \nCALPUFF nitrate to sulfate ratio results, however, because there was no \npoint sources modeled with CALPUFF.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See appendix D, ``MANEVU Updated Q/d*C Contribution \nAssessment.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In order to develop a final set of contribution estimates, MANEVU \nweighted the results from both the Q/d and CALPUFF analyses. The MANEVU \nmass-weighted sulfate and nitrate contribution results were reported \nfor the MANEVU Class I areas. (The Q/d summary report included results \nfor several non-MANEVU areas as well). If a state's contribution to \nsulfate and nitrate concentrations at a particular Class I area was 2 \npercent or greater, MANEVU regarded that state as contributing to \nvisibility impairment in that area. According to MANEVU's analyses, \nVermont's highest percent mass-weighted sulfate and nitrate \ncontribution was estimated to be 2.1% at New Hampshire's two Class I \nareas, with contributions ranging from 0.3% to 0.8% at the other nearby \nClass I areas.\n    The EPA concluded in the 1999 RHR that ``all [s]tates contain \nsources whose\n\n[[Page 22039]]\n\nemissions are reasonably anticipated to contribute to regional haze in \na Class I area,'' 64 FR at 35721, and this determination was not \nchanged in the 2017 RHR. Critically, the statute and regulation both \nrequire that the cause-or-contribute assessment consider all emissions \nof visibility-impairing pollutants from a state, as opposed to \nemissions of a particular pollutant or emissions from a certain set of \nsources. The screening analyses on which MANEVU relied are useful for \ncertain purposes. MANEVU used information from its technical analysis \nto rank the largest contributing states to sulfate and nitrate \nimpairment in the seven Class I areas in the MANEVU region and three \nadditional, nearby Class I areas.\\19\\ The rankings were used to \ndetermine upwind states that MANEVU deemed important to include in \nstate-to-state consultation (based on an identified visibility impact \nscreening threshold). Additionally, large individual source impacts \nwere used to target MANEVU control analysis ``Asks'' \\20\\ of states and \nsources both within and upwind of MANEVU.\\21\\ The EPA finds the nature \nof the analyses generally appropriate to support decisions on states \nwith which to consult.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ The Class I areas analyzed were Acadia National Park in \nMaine, Brigantine Wilderness in New Jersey, Great Gulf Wilderness \nand Presidential Range--Dry River Wilderness in New Hampshire, Lye \nBrook Wilderness in Vermont, Moosehorn Wilderness in Maine, \nRoosevelt-Campobello International Park in New Brunswick, Shenandoah \nNational Park in Virginia, James River Face Wilderness in Virginia, \nand Dolly Sods/Otter Creek Wildernesses in West Virginia.\n    \\20\\ As explained more fully in Section IV.E.a of this proposed \nrulemaking, MANEVU refers to each of the components of its overall \nstrategy as an ``Ask ``of its member states.\n    \\21\\ The MANEVU consultation report (Appendix G) explains that \n``[t]he objective of this technical work was to identify states and \nsources from which MANEVU will pursue further analysis. This \nscreening was intended to identify which states to invite to \nconsultation, not a definitive list of which states are \ncontributing.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    With regard to the analysis and determinations regarding Vermont's \ncontribution to visibility impairment at out-of-state Class I areas, \nthe MANEVU technical work focuses on the magnitude of visibility \nimpacts from certain Vermont emissions on its Class I area and other \nnearby Class I areas. The MANEVU contribution screening results \nestimate Vermont's highest percent mass-weighted sulfate and nitrate \ncontribution to be 2.1% at Great Gulf Wilderness and the Presidential \nRange-Dry River Wilderness in New Hampshire, with progressively lower \ncontributions at Moosehorn Wilderness Area in Maine and Roosevelt-\nCampobello International Park in New Brunswick (0.8%), Acadia National \nPark in Maine (0.6%), Lye Brook Wilderness Area in Vermont (0.3%), and \nBrigantine Wilderness Area in New Jersey (0.2%). However, the analyses \ndid not account for all emissions and all components of visibility \nimpairment (e.g., primary PM emissions, and impairment from fine PM, \nelemental carbon, and organic carbon). In addition, Q/d analyses with a \nrelatively simplistic accounting for wind trajectories and CALPUFF \napplied to a very limited set of EGUs and major industrial sources of \nSO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> are not scientifically rigorous tools \ncapable of evaluating contribution to visibility impairment from all \nemissions in a state. The EPA acknowledges that the contribution to \nvisibility impairment from Vermont's emissions at Class I areas is \nsignificantly smaller than that from numerous other MANEVU states.\\22\\ \nAnd while some MANEVU states noted that the contributions from several \nstates outside the MANEVU region are significantly larger than its own, \neach state is obligated under the CAA and RHR to address regional haze \nvisibility impairment resulting from emissions from within the state, \nirrespective of whether another state's contribution is greater. \nAdditionally, we note that the 2 percent or greater sulfate-plus-\nnitrate threshold used to determine whether Vermont emissions \ncontribute to visibility impairment at a particular Class I area may be \nhigher than what EPA believes is an ``extremely low triggering \nthreshold'' intended by the statute and regulations. In sum, based on \nthe information provided, it is clear that emissions from Vermont \ncontribute to visibility impairment in the Class I areas in New \nHampshire and otherwise have relatively small contributions to the \nother nearby Class I areas. However, due to the low triggering \nthreshold implied by the Rule and the lack of rigorous modeling \nanalyses, we do not necessarily agree with the level of the State's 2% \ncontribution threshold.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ Because MANEVU did not include all Vermont's emissions or \ncontributions to visibility impairment in its analysis, we cannot \ndefinitively state that Vermont's contribution to visibility \nimpairment is not the most significant. However, that is very likely \nthe case.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Regardless, we note that Vermont did determine that sources and \nemissions within the state, largely from the inclusion of state-wide \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions from the mobile source sector and area sources \ninto the modeling, contribute to a 2.1% visibility impairment at NH \nClass I sites. Furthermore, pursuant to the regulatory requirements, \nVermont took part in the emission control strategy consultation process \nas a member of MANEVU. As part of that process, MANEVU developed a set \nof emissions reduction measures identified as being necessary to make \nreasonable progress in the seven MANEVU Class I areas. This strategy \nconsists of six ``Asks'' for states within MANEVU and five Asks for \nstates outside the region that were found to impact visibility at Class \nI areas within MANEVU.\\23\\ Vermont's submission discusses each of the \nAsks and explains why or why not each is applicable and how it has \ncomplied with the relevant components of the emissions control strategy \nMANEVU has laid out for its states. Vermont worked with MANEVU to \ndetermine potential reasonable measures that could be implemented by \n2028, considering the cost of compliance, the time necessary for \ncompliance, the energy and non-air quality environmental impacts, and \nthe remaining useful life of any potentially affected sources. As \ndiscussed in further detail below, the EPA is proposing to find that \nVermont has submitted a regional haze plan that meets the requirements \nof 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2) related to the development of a long-term \nstrategy. Thus, we propose to find that Vermont has satisfied the \napplicable requirements for making reasonable progress towards natural \nvisibility conditions in Class I areas that may be affected by \nemissions from the state.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ See Appendix G ``MANEVU Regional Haze Consultation Report \nand Consultation Documentation.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nD. Calculations of Baseline, Current, and Natural Visibility \nConditions; Progress to Date; and the Uniform Rate of Progress\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(1) requires states to determine the following for \n``each mandatory Class I Federal area located within the State'': \nbaseline visibility conditions for the most impaired and clearest days, \nnatural visibility conditions for the most impaired and clearest days, \nprogress to date for the most impaired and clearest days, the \ndifferences between current visibility conditions and natural \nvisibility conditions, and the URP. This section also provides the \noption for states to propose adjustments to the URP line for a Class I \narea to account for visibility impacts from anthropogenic sources \noutside the United States and/or the impacts from wildland prescribed \nfires that were conducted for certain, specified objectives. 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(1)(vi)(B).\n    The Lye Brook Wilderness area has 2000-2004 baseline visibility \nconditions of 6.37 deciviews on the 20% clearest days and 23.57 \ndeciviews on the 20%\n\n[[Page 22040]]\n\nmost impaired days.\\24\\ Vermont calculated an estimated natural \nbackground visibility of 2.79 deciviews on the 20% clearest days and \n10.24 deciviews on the 20% most impaired days for the Lye Brook \nWilderness area.\\25\\ The current visibility conditions, which are based \non 2015-2019 monitoring data, were 4.88 deciviews on the clearest days \nand 14.06 deciviews on the most impaired days,\\26\\ which represents an \nimprovement from the baseline period of 1.49 deciviews on the 20% \nclearest days and 9.51 deciviews on the 20% most impaired days.\\27\\ In \naddition, current visibility conditions are 2.09 and 3.82 deciviews \ngreater than natural conditions on the respective sets of days.\\28\\ For \nthe second implementation period, Vermont calculated an annual URP of \n0.222 deciviews needed to reach natural visibility on the 20% most \nimpaired days.\\29\\ Vermont noted that current visibility conditions on \nthe most impaired days in the Lye Brook Wilderness Area, at 14.06 \ndeciviews, are already below the 2028 URP glidepath of 18.24 deciviews \nfor the end of the second SIP planning period.\\30\\ Vermont has not \nproposed any adjustments to the URP to account for impacts from \nanthropogenic sources outside the United States or from wildland \nprescribed fires. EPA is proposing to find that Vermont has submitted a \nregional haze plan that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(f)(1) \nrelated to the calculations of baseline, current, and natural \nvisibility conditions; progress to date; and the uniform rate of \nprogress for the second implementation period.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\24\\ See VT Regional Haze SIP Submission, Table 4-1, ``Baseline \nVisibility for the 20% Baseline visibility for the 20% most impaired \ndays and 20% clearest days (2000-2004) in MANEVU mandatory Class I \nFederal areas.''\n    \\25\\ See id., Table 4-2 ``Visibility under natural conditions \nand difference between baseline and natural conditions for the 20% \nmost impaired days and 20% clearest days in MANEVU mandatory Class I \nFederal areas.''\n    \\26\\ See id., Table 4-3: ``Baseline, current, and reasonable \nprogress goal haze index levels for Class I areas in or adjacent to \nthe MANEVU Region.''\n    \\27\\ Id. at 32.\n    \\28\\ Id.\n    \\29\\ Id, at 33.\n    \\30\\ Id, at 32-33.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nE. Long-Term Strategy for Regional Haze\n\na. Vermont's Response to the Six MANEVU Asks\n    Each state having a Class I area within its borders or emissions \nthat may affect visibility in a Class I area must develop a long-term \nstrategy for making reasonable progress towards the national visibility \ngoal. CAA 169A(b)(2)(B). After considering the four statutory factors, \nall measures that are determined to be necessary to make reasonable \nprogress must be in the long-term strategy. In developing its long-term \nstrategies, a state must also consider the five additional factors in \nsection 51.308(f)(2)(iv). As part of its reasonable progress \ndeterminations, the state must describe the criteria used to determine \nwhich sources or group of sources were evaluated (i.e., subjected to \nfour-factor analysis) for the second implementation period and how the \nfour factors were taken into consideration in selecting the emission \nreduction measures for inclusion in the long-term strategy. 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)(iii).\n    The following section summarizes how Vermont addresses the \nrequirements of section 51.308(f)(2)(i), including a discussion of the \nsix Asks developed by MANEVU and how Vermont addressed each. The \nregulations Vermont identifies as a result of its responses to the six \nAsks comprise Vermont's long-term strategy for the second planning \nperiod to address regional haze visibility impairment for each \nmandatory Class I Federal area that may be affected by emissions from \nVermont. In Section IV.E.b. of the NPRM, EPA evaluates Vermont's \ncompliance with the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i).\n    States may rely on technical information developed by the RPOs of \nwhich they are members to select sources for four-factor analysis and \nto conduct that analysis, as well as to satisfy the documentation \nrequirements under 40 CFR 51.308(f). Where an RPO has performed source \nselection and/or four-factor analyses (or considered the five \nadditional factors in 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iv)) for its member states, \nthose states may rely on the RPO's analyses for the purpose of \nsatisfying the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(i) so long as the \nstates have a reasonable basis to do so and all state participants in \nthe RPO process have approved the technical analyses. 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)(iii). States may also satisfy the requirement of 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)(ii) to engage in interstate consultation with other states \nthat have emissions that are reasonably anticipated to contribute to \nvisibility impairment in a given Class I area under the auspices of \nintra- and inter-RPO engagement.\n    Vermont is a member of the MANEVU RPO and participated in the RPO's \nregional approach to developing a strategy for making reasonable \nprogress towards the national visibility goal in the MANEVU Class I \nareas. MANEVU's strategy includes a combination of: (1) Measures for \ncertain source sectors and groups of sectors that the RPO determined \nwere reasonable for states to pursue, and (2) a request for member \nstates to conduct four-factor analyses for individual sources that it \nidentified as contributing to visibility impairment. MANEVU refers to \neach of the components of its overall strategy as an ``Ask'' of its \nmember states. On August 25, 2017, the Executive Director of MANEVU, on \nbehalf of the MANEVU states and tribal nations, signed a statement that \nidentifies six emission reduction measures that comprise the Asks for \nthe second implementation period.\\31\\ The Asks were ``designed to \nidentify reasonable emission reduction strategies that must be \naddressed by the states and tribal nations of MANEVU through their \nregional haze SIP updates.'' \\32\\ The statement explains that ``[i]f \nany State cannot agree with or complete a Class I State's Asks, the \nState must describe the actions taken to resolve the disagreement in \nthe Regional Haze SIP.'' \\33\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\31\\ See Appendix G ``MANEVU Regional Haze Consultation Report \nand Consultation Documentation.''\n    \\32\\ Id.\n    \\33\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    MANEVU's recommendations as to the appropriate control measures \nwere based on technical analyses documented in the RPO's reports and \nincluded as appendices to or referenced in Vermont's regional haze SIP \nsubmission. One of the initial steps of MANEVU's technical analysis was \nto determine which visibility-impairing pollutants should be the focus \nof its efforts for the second implementation period. In the first \nimplementation period, MANEVU determined that sulfates were the most \nsignificant visibility impairing pollutant at the region's Class I \nareas. To determine the impact of certain pollutants on visibility at \nClass I areas for the purpose of second implementation period planning, \nMANEVU conducted an analysis comparing the pollutant contribution on \nthe clearest and most impaired days in the baseline period (2000-2004) \nto the most recent period (2012-2016) \\34\\ at MANEVU and nearby Class I \nareas. MANEVU found that while SO<INF>2</INF> emissions were decreasing \nand visibility was improving, sulfates still made up the most \nsignificant contribution to visibility impairment at MANEVU and nearby \nClass I areas. According to the analysis, NO<INF>X</INF> emissions have \nbegun to\n\n[[Page 22041]]\n\nplay a more significant role in visibility impacts in recent years as \nSO<INF>2</INF> emissions have decreased. The technical analyses used by \nVermont are included in their submission and are as follows:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\34\\ The period of 2012-2016 was the most recent period for \nwhich data were available at the time of analysis. VT also included \n2015-2019 data, discussed above in part D of this section.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> 2016 Updates to the Assessment of Reasonable Progress for \nRegional Haze in MANEVU Class I Areas (Appendix L);\n    <bullet> Impact of Wintertime SCR/SNCR Optimization on Visibility \nImpairing Nitrate Precursor Emissions.

(Appendix M).\n    MANEVU gathered information on each of the four statutory factors \nfor six source sectors it determined, based on an examination of annual \nemission inventories, ``had emissions [of SO<INF>2</INF> and/or \nNO<INF>X</INF>] that were reasonabl[y] anticipated to contribute to \nvisibility degradation in MANEVU:'' electric generating units (EGUs), \nindustrial/commercial/institutional boilers (ICI boilers), cement \nkilns, heating oil, residential wood combustion, and outdoor wood \ncombustion.\\35\\ MANEVU also collected data on individual sources within \nthe EGU, ICI boiler, and cement kiln sectors.\\36\\ Information for the \nsix sectors included explanations of technically feasible control \noptions for SO<INF>2</INF> or NO<INF>X,</INF> illustrative cost-\neffectiveness estimates for a range of model units and control options, \nsector-wide cost considerations, potential time frames for compliance \nwith control options, potential energy and non-air-quality \nenvironmental impacts of certain control options, and how the remaining \nuseful lives of sources might be considered in a control analysis.\\37\\ \nSource-specific data included SO<INF>2</INF> emissions \\38\\ and \nexisting controls \\39\\ for certain existing EGUs, ICI boilers, and \ncement kilns. MANEVU considered this information on the four factors as \nwell as the analyses developed by the RPO's Technical Support Committee \nwhen it determined specific emission reduction measures that were found \nto be reasonable for certain sources within two of the sectors it had \nexamined--EGUs and ICI boilers.\\40\\ The Asks were based on this \nanalysis and looked to optimize the use of existing controls, have \nstates conduct further analysis on EGU or ICI boilers with considerable \nvisibility impacts, implement low sulfur fuel standards, or lock-in \nlower emission rates.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\35\\ See appendix K ``MANEVU Four Factor Data Collection Memo at \n1, March 30, 2017.''\n    \\36\\ See appendix L ``2016 Updates to the Assessment of \nReasonable Progress for Regional Haze in MANEVU Class I Areas, Jan. \n31, 2016.''\n    \\37\\ Id.\n    \\38\\ See appendix K ``Four Factor Data Collection Memo.''\n    \\39\\ See appendix M ``Status of the Top 167 Stacks from the 2008 \nMANEVU Ask. July 2016.''\n    \\40\\ See Appendix K ``Four Factor Data Collection Memo''; \nAppendix L ``2016 Updates to the Assessment of Reasonable Progress \nfor Regional Haze in MANEVU Class I Areas.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    MANEVU Ask 1 is ``ensuring the most effective use of control \ntechnologies on a year-round basis'' at EGUs with a nameplate capacity \nlarger than or equal to 25 megawatts (MW) with already installed \nNO<INF>X</INF> and/or SO<INF>2</INF> controls in order to consistently \nminimize emissions of haze precursors or obtain equivalent alternative \nemission reductions.\\41\\ MANEVU observed that EGUs often only run \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions controls to comply with ozone season trading \nprograms and consequently, NO<INF>X</INF> sources may be uncontrolled \nduring the winter and non-peak summer days. MANEVU found that: (1) \nrunning existing installed controls [selective catalytic reduction \n(SCR) and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR)] is one of the most \ncost-effective ways to control NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from EGUs; and \n(2) that running existing controls year-round could substantially \nreduce the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in many of the states upwind of \nClass I areas in MANEVU that lead to visibility impairment during the \nwinter from nitrates.\\42\\ MANEVU included this as an emission \nmanagement strategy because large EGUs had already been identified as \ndominant contributors to visibility impairment and the low cost of \nrunning already installed controls made it reasonable. One EGU in \nVermont was identified as meeting the criteria of Ask 1. This source is \nMcNeil Generating Station of the Burlington Electric Department, a \nbiomass-fired EGU that can also fire natural gas and oil.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\41\\ See Appendix G ``MANEVU Regional Haze Consultation Report \nand Consultation Documentation--Final.''\n    \\42\\ See Appendix Q ``Impact of Wintertime SCR/SNCR Optimization \non Visibility Impairing Nitrate Precursor Emissions.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    McNeil Generating Station has a nameplate capacity of 50 MW and is \nthe largest point source of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in Vermont, at 130 \ntons per year (tpy). McNeil employs SCR as NO<INF>X</INF> Reasonably \nAvailable Control Technology (RACT) in order to qualify for Class I \nrenewable energy credits in New England.\\43\\ The facility also employs \nlow NO<INF>X</INF> burners when firing natural gas. The facility's \nshort-term NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limits are 0.23 lbs/MMBtu and 145 \nlbs/hr when burning wood, 0.23 lbs/MMBtu and 57.5 lbs/hr when firing \noil, and 0.13 lbs/MMBtu and 88 lbs/hr for natural gas. To meet the \nNO<INF>X</INF> RACT requirement, the facility is also subject to a \nNO<INF>X</INF> limit of 0.075 lbs/MMBtu based on a calendar quarterly \naverage. SO<INF>2</INF> emissions limitations are set at 0.0015 lbs/\nMMBtu for oil. Wood and natural gas have inherently low SO<INF>2</INF> \nemissions when burned for fuel. These limits were incorporated into the \nTitle V operating permit, issued on June 14, 2018. These controls are \nalso required to be run at all times, including periods of startup, \nshutdown, and malfunction, on a year-round basis. VT DEC also \ndetermined that the source effectively utilizes NO<INF>X</INF> and \nSO<INF>2</INF> controls year-round. Since these controls are already in \neffect and are required to operate year-round, VT DEC concluded that it \nmet the requirements of Ask 1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\43\\ Vermont's most recently revised NO<INF>X</INF> RACT program \nwas approved into the SIP on 11/26/2019 (84 FR 65011).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    MANEVU Ask 2 consists of a request that states ``Emission sources \nmodeled by MANEVU that have the potential for 3.0 Mm<SUP>-1</SUP> or \ngreater visibility impacts at any MANEVU Class I area, as identified by \nMANEVU contribution analyses . . .perform a four-factor analysis for \nreasonable installation or upgrade to emissions controls''. MANEVU \ndeveloped its Ask 2 list of sources for analysis by performing modeling \nand identifying facilities with the potential for 3.0 inverse \nmegameters (Mm<SUP>-1</SUP>) or greater impacts on visibility at any \nClass I area in the MANEVU region. For units identified for the Ask 2 \nanalysis, MANEVU requested that states determine reasonable controls \nthrough the consideration of the four factors on a state-by-state and \nunit-by-unit basis. MANEVU's analysis for Ask 2 did not identify any \nunits in Vermont with a potential impact of 3.0 Mm<SUP>-1</SUP> or \ngreater at any MANEVU Class I area. Based on the lack of identified \nsources at or above the 3.0 Mm<SUP>-1</SUP> threshold, Vermont\n\n[[Page 22042]]\n\ntherefore concluded that it satisfied Ask 2.\n    Ask 3 is for each MANEVU state to pursue an ultra-low sulfur fuel \noil standard if it has not already done so. The Ask includes percent by \nweight standards for #2 distillate oil (0.0015% sulfur by weight or 15 \nppm), #4 residual oil (0.25-0.5% sulfur by weight), and #6 residual oil \n(0.3-0.5% sulfur by weight). Vermont adopted the MANEVU low-sulfur fuel \noil strategy into Vermont's Air Pollution Control Regulations (VT APCR \n5-221(1)) on September 28, 2011. Beginning in 2014, the first phase of \nlimitations lowered the allowable concentration of sulfur in No. 2 and \nlighter distillate fuels to 0.05% (500 ppm) by weight. In 2018, the \nbeginning of the second implementation period, the second phase of \nlimitations further lowered the limit to 0.0015% (15 ppm) by weight. In \naddition, the second phase also lowered the sulfur limit for No. 4 \nresidual oils to 0.25% (2500 ppm) by weight, as well as for No. 5 and \nNo. 6 residual oils, heavier residual oils, and used oils to 0.5% (5000 \nppm) by weight. EPA approved APCR revised Section 5-221(1), \n``Prohibition of Potentially Polluting Materials in Fuel,'' into \nVermont's SIP on May 22, 2012 [77 FR 30212]. Since Vermont has fully \nimplemented an ultra-low sulfur fuel oil standard, the State therefore \nconcluded that it met Ask 3.\n    MANEVU Ask 4 requests states to update permits to ``lock in'' lower \nemissions rates for NO<INF>X</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, and PM at emissions \nsources larger than 250 million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) per hour \nheat input that have switched to lower emitting fuels. The threshold of \n250 MMBTU/hour was based on prior BART analysis. Because there aren't \nany large coal burning units in Vermont, this Ask pertains only to oil \nburning units. Vermont did not identify any dual/multi-fuel units \nlarger than 250 MMBTU/hour that had made a physical change to switch to \na cleaner fuel. All such dual/multi-fuel units are either continuing to \nburn a mix of fuels or are choosing to maintain their ability to do so \nin the future. Vermont submitted that there are no such facilities in \nthe State and therefore concluded it met Ask 4.\n    Ask 5 requests that MANEVU states ``control NO<INF>X</INF> \nemissions for peaking combustion turbines that have the potential to \noperate on high electric demand days'' by either: (1) Meeting \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions standards specified in the Ask for turbines \nthat run on natural gas and fuel oil, (2) performing a four-factor \nanalysis for reasonable installation of or upgrade to emission \ncontrols, or (3) obtaining equivalent emission reductions on high \nelectric demand days.\\44\\ The Ask requests states to strive for \nNO<INF>X</INF> emission standards of no greater than 25 ppm for natural \ngas and 42 ppm for fuel oil, or at a minimum, NO<INF>X</INF> emissions \nstandards of no greater than 42 ppm for natural gas and 96 ppm at for \nfuel oil. The peaking combustion turbines located at Vermont stationary \nsources that were identified as meeting the criteria of Ask 5 are: \nGreen Mountain Power (GMP) Unit No. 5 in Berlin, VT and Unit No. 16 in \nColchester, VT (Gorge 16). Unit No. 5 is comprised of two combustion \nturbines (Berlin 5A and 5B) connected to a single electrical power \ngenerator. GMP provided VT DEC with four-factor analyses of these three \nturbines for installation or upgrade to NO<INF>X</INF> emission \ncontrols. According to the analysis of calendar year 2019, Berlin 5A \nand 5B were operated 10.9 and 11.4 hours, respectively, with total \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions equating to .91 tons and .71 tons, \nrespectively. Gorge 16 was operated for 28.9 hours and emitted 1.31 \ntons of NO<INF>X</INF>. GMP concluded there were no additional \nNO<INF>X</INF> controls that GMP could employ on any of the combustion \nturbines that are both technically and economically feasible. GMP \ncalculated the lowest cost effectiveness value for a control option to \nbe over $38,000/ton of NO<INF>X</INF> removed. VT DEC acknowledged, \nhowever, that the year of emissions it asked GMP to use for the \nanalyses, 2019, totaled the lowest emissions from the units for the \nperiod spanning 2014 to 2023. Thus, VT DEC recalculated the cost \neffectiveness of additional controls based on the median annual \nemissions for that ten-year period for each source because the median \nrepresents ``typical'' annual emissions better than each source's 2019 \nannual emissions do.\\45\\ Berlin 5A, Berlin 5B and Gorge 16 emitted \nmedian annual emissions of 3.0, 2.8, and 2.9 tons per year, \nrespectively. Based on these median annual emissions values, VT DEC \ncalculates the cost effectiveness values for controls to range from \n$17,074/ton of NO<INF>X</INF> controlled for water injection to \n$48,842,067/ton of NO<INF>X</INF> for SCR. VT DEC concluded that \nrequiring the installation of additional emissions controls at these \nturbines is unreasonable for the second planning period due to a \ncombination of low hours of operation, low annual emissions generated, \nthe limited life expectancy of the units (each unit is over 50 years \nold), possible non-air quality environmental effects of waste products \nfrom controls (for SCR), and the cost per ton of emissions reduced. \nThus, VT DEC concurred with GMP's initial findings that controls on \nthese three sources are not necessary to make reasonable progress. \nVermont, based on the low usage, low overall emissions, and the four-\nfactor analyses provided by GMP, concluded it met Ask 5.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\44\\ See appendix G ``MANEVU Regional Haze Consultation Report \nand Consultation Documentation.''\n    \\45\\ VT Regional Haze Submission at 50.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Ask 6 requests MANEVU states to report in their regional haze SIPs \nabout programs that decrease energy demand and increase the use of \ncombined heat and power (CHP) and other distributed generation \ntechnologies such as fuel cells, wind and solar. Vermont has a \nComprehensive Energy Plan which describes strategies to decrease energy \ndemand via energy efficiency and modernize the electrical grid to \nhandle distributed energy resources.\\46\\ The Comprehensive Energy Plan \nexplains, for example, that the State delivers electric efficiency \nprograms and services primarily through Energy Efficiency Utilities \n(EEUs) that provide technical, financial, and educational services to \nimprove the energy efficiency of homes, businesses, institutions, and \nmunicipal facilities.\\47\\ Residential energy efficiency investments \nhave been encouraged through rebates and technical assistance, thus far \namounting to 13 million tons of decreased carbon dioxide emissions \nsince 2000. More information can be found in Vermont's most recent \nClimate Action Plan.\\48\\ In addition, Vermont participates in the \nRegional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a Northeast and Mid-Atlantic \nstate initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to \nglobal climate change. The initiative creates a market for emissions \nallowances through a regional cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas \nemissions from area power plants. As a co-benefit of this program, \nemissions of particle producing pollutants are also reduced. Vermont \nemissions allowances are sold at auctions and the proceeds provide \nfunding for the EEUs mentioned in the Comprehensive Energy Plan.\\49\\ \nVermont is also considering how best to address the implementation of \nthe State's Global Warming Solutions Act, which is managed by Vermont's \nAgency of\n\n[[Page 22043]]\n\nNatural Resources (ANR) Climate Office and is expected to further \nreduce greenhouse gas and, as a co-benefit, particle producing \npollutants. Vermont concluded it meets Ask 6.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\46\\ A copy of Vermont's most recent Comprehensive Energy Plan \ncan be found in the docket of this proposed rulemaking and at: \n<a href=\"https://publicservice.vermont.gov/sites/dps/files/documents/2022VermontComprehensiveEnergyPlan_0.pdf\">https://publicservice.vermont.gov/sites/dps/files/documents/2022VermontComprehensiveEnergyPlan_0.pdf</a>.\n    \\47\\ See Comprehensive Energy Plan at Section 7.5.\n    \\48\\ Vermont's most recent Climate Action Plan can be found \nhere: <a href=\"https://climatechange.vermont.gov/readtheplan\">https://climatechange.vermont.gov/readtheplan</a>.\n    \\49\\ Information on Vermont's involvement in the RGGI can be \nfound here: <a href=\"https://dec.vermont.gov/air-quality/climate-change/rggi\">https://dec.vermont.gov/air-quality/climate-change/rggi</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In sum, Vermont provided four-factor analyses and identified \nseveral SIP-approved mechanisms for controlling pollutants that impair \nvisibility and that are necessary for reasonable progress--including \nits regulations limiting sulfur content in fuels and continued \neffective use of NO<INF>X</INF> controls. Vermont also considers its \nmobile source emission reduction strategies which reduce NO<INF>X</INF> \nemissions in the state to provide reasonable progress in improving \nvisibility. Additionally, the projected 2028 visibility conditions for \nClass I areas in Vermont and influenced by emissions from Vermont \nsources are all below the URP.\nb. The EPA's Evaluation of Vermont's Response to the Six MANEVU Asks \nand Compliance With section 51.308(f)(2)(i)\n    The EPA is proposing to find that Vermont has satisfied the \nrequirements of section 51.308(f)(2)(i) related to evaluating sources \nand determining the emission reduction measures that are necessary to \nmake reasonable progress by considering the four statutory factors. We \nare proposing to find that Vermont has satisfied the four-factor \nanalysis requirement through its analysis and actions to address MANEVU \nAsks 3 and 5. Additionally, in line with recent proposals from the \nEPA,\\50\\ it is the Agency's policy that, where visibility conditions \nfor a Class I area impacted by a State are below the URP and the State \nhas considered the four statutory factors, the State will have \npresumptively demonstrated reasonable progress for the second planning \nperiod for that area.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\50\\ See proposed rulemakings published April 18, 2025 (90 FR \n16478) and May 14, 2025 (90 FR 20425).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As explained above, Vermont relied on MANEVU's technical analyses \nand framework (i.e., the Asks) to select sources and develop its long-\nterm strategy. MANEVU conducted an inventory analysis to identify the \nsource sectors that produced the greatest amount of SO<INF>2</INF> and \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions in 2011; inventory data were also projected to \n2018. Based on this analysis, MANEVU identified the top-emitting \nsectors for each of those two pollutants. For SO<INF>2</INF>, those \nsources include coal-fired EGUs, industrial boilers, oil-fired EGUs, \nand oil-fired area sources including residential, commercial, and \nindustrial sources. In Vermont, the largest sources of NO<INF>X</INF> \ninclude on-road vehicles, non-road vehicles, and EGUs.\\51\\ The RPO's \ndocumentation explains that ``[EGUs] emitting SO<INF>2</INF> and \nNO<INF>X</INF> and industrial point sources emitting SO<INF>2</INF> \nwere found to be sectors with high emissions that warranted further \nscrutiny. Mobile sources were not considered in this analysis because \nany ask concerning mobile sources would be made to EPA and not during \nthe intra-RPO and inter-RPO consultation process among the states and \ntribes.'' \\52\\ EPA proposes to find that Vermont reasonably evaluated \nthe two pollutants--SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF>--that currently \ndrive visibility impairment within the MANEVU region and that the State \nadequately explained and supported its decision to focus on these two \npollutants through its reliance on the MANEVU technical analyses cited \nin its submission.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\51\\ See appendix H ``Contribution Assessment.''\n    \\52\\ See appendix G, ``MANEVU Regional Haze Consultation Report \nand Consultation Documentation.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(2)(i) requires states to evaluate sources or a \ngroup of sources and determine the emission reduction measures that are \nnecessary to make reasonable progress by considering the four statutory \nfactors. As explained previously, the MANEVU Asks are a mix of measures \nfor sectors and groups of sources identified as reasonable for states \nto address in their regional haze plans. While MANEVU formulated the \nAsks to be ``reasonable emission reduction strategies'' to control \nemissions of visibility-impairing pollutants,\\53\\ Vermont's responses, \nin two of the Asks in particular, engage with the requirement that \nStates determine the emission reduction measures that are necessary to \nmake reasonable progress through consideration of the four factors. As \nlaid out in further detail below, the EPA is proposing to find that \nMANEVU's four-factor analysis conducted to support the emission \nreduction measures in Ask 3 (ultra-low sulfur fuel oil), in conjunction \nwith Vermont's analysis and explanation of how it has complied with Ask \n5 (perform four-factor analyses for measures to control NO<INF>X</INF> \nemissions at certain peaking combustion turbines) satisfy the \nrequirement of section 51.308(f)(2)(i). The emission reduction measures \nthat are necessary to make reasonable progress must be included in the \nlong-term strategy, i.e., in Vermont's SIP. 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\53\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For Ask 1, Vermont included an analysis of its one EGU (McNeil \nStation) subject to the Ask (i.e., a generation capacity >=25MW with \noperative NO<INF>X</INF> and/or SO<INF>2</INF> controls). Vermont \nasserted that it satisfies Ask 1 because McNeil's NO<INF>X</INF> and \nSO<INF>2</INF> emissions limits are based on the use of SCR, low \nNO<INF>X</INF> burners, low sulfur fuel and apply year-round. EPA thus \nagrees that Vermont satisfied Ask 1.\n    Ask 2 addresses the sources MANEVU determined have the potential \nfor larger than, or equal to, 3.0 Mm<SUP>-1</SUP> visibility impact at \nany MANEVU Class I area; the Ask requests MANEVU states to conduct \nfour-factor analyses for the specified sources within their borders. \nThis Ask explicitly engages with the statutory and regulatory \nrequirement to determine the emission reduction measures necessary to \nmake reasonable progress based on the four factors; MANEVU considered \nit ``reasonable to have the greatest contributors to visibility \nimpairment conduct a four-factor analysis that would determine whether \nemission control measures should be pursued and what would be \nreasonable for each source.'' \\54\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\54\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The RHR recognizes that, due to the nature of regional haze \nvisibility impairment, numerous and sometimes relatively small sources \nmay need to be selected and evaluated for control measures in order to \nmake reasonable progress.\\55\\ In this case, applying the 3.0 \nMm<SUP>-1</SUP> threshold did not identify any sources in Vermont (and \nonly 22 across the entire MANEVU region). We note, however, that the \n3.0 Mm-1 threshold used in this Ask is only one part of the MANEVU \nsource identification process and that being below this threshold did \nnot necessarily exclude a source from additional review in connection \nwith another Ask.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\55\\ See Responses to Comments on Protection of Visibility: \nAmendments to Requirements for State Plans; Proposed Rule (81 FR \n26942, May 4, 2016), Docket Number EPA-HQ-OAR-2015-0531, U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency at 87-88.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    EPA agrees that Vermont reasonably determined it has satisfied Ask \n2. MANEVU's threshold did not identify any sources in Vermont for four-\nfactor analysis. However, EPA notes that Vermont's point sources have \nvery low NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> emissions overall. While \nVermont did not provide light extinction estimates (Mm<SUP>-</SUP>\\1\\) \nfor its top-emitting sources, it did note that its top NO<INF>X</INF> \npoint source emitter, McNeil Station, averages only about 130 tons of \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions per year.\\56\\ Vermont's next top four \nNO<INF>X</INF> emitters account for only about an additional 200 tons \nof NO<INF>X</INF> per year in total.\\57\\ Similarly, Vermont estimates \nthat its top five highest SO<INF>2</INF> emitters together account\n\n[[Page 22044]]\n\nfor less than 100 tons of SO<INF>2</INF> per year.\\58\\ Furthermore, \nwhile Vermont did not consider the four statutory factors for any \nsources in response to Ask 2, it did do so in response to Ask 5, where \nit examined emissions reduction measures necessary for three combustion \nturbines associated with GMP Unit No. 5 and No. 16 as part of Ask \n5.\\59\\ EPA is basing this proposed finding on the state's examination \nof its largest operating point sources at the time of SIP submission, \nand on the emissions from and controls that apply to those sources, as \nwell as on Vermont's existing SIP-approved NO<INF>X</INF> and \nSO<INF>2</INF> rules that effectively control emissions from the \nlargest contributing stationary-source sectors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\56\\ VT Regional Haze SIP Submission at 48.\n    \\57\\ Id. at 47-48.\n    \\58\\ Id.\n    \\59\\ See Appendix T ``Green Mountain Power, Regional Haze \nReasonable Progress Four-Factor Analysis,'' Trinity Consultants \n(December 18, 2020); VT Regional Haze SIP Submission, at 49-50.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Ask 3, which addresses the sulfur content of heating oil used in \nMANEVU states, is based on a four-factor analysis for the heating oil \nsulfur reduction regulations contained in that Ask; \\60\\ specifically, \nfor the control strategy of reducing the sulfur content of distillate \noil to 15 ppm. The analysis started with an assessment of the costs of \nretrofitting refineries to produce 15 ppm heating oil in sufficient \nquantities to support implementation of the standard, as well as the \nimpacts of requiring a reduction in sulfur content on consumer prices. \nThe analysis noted that, as a result of previous EPA rulemakings to \nreduce the sulfur content of on-road and non-road-fuels to 15 ppm, \ntechnologies are currently available to achieve sulfur reductions and \nmany refiners are already meeting this standard, meaning that the \ncapital investments for further reductions in the sulfur content of \nheating oil are expected to be relatively low compared to costs \nincurred in the past. The analysis also examined by way of example, the \nimpacts of New York's existing 15 ppm sulfur requirements on heating \noil prices and concluded that the cost associated with further reducing \nsulfur was relatively small in terms of the absolute price of heating \noil compared to the magnitude of volatility in crude oil prices. It \nalso noted that the additional marginal costs would be offset by cost \nsavings due to the benefits of lower-sulfur fuels in terms of equipment \nlife and maintenance and fuel stability. Consideration of the time \nnecessary for compliance with a 15ppm sulfur standard was accomplished \nthrough a discussion of the amount of time refiners had needed to \ncomply with the EPA's on-road and non-road fuel 15 ppm requirement, and \nthe implications existing refinery capacity and distribution \ninfrastructure may have for compliance times with a 15-ppm heating oil \nstandard. The analysis concluded that with phased-in timing for states \nthat have not yet adopted a 15 ppm heating oil standard there ``appears \nto be sufficient time to allow refiners to add any additional heating \noil capacity that may be required.'' \\61\\ The analysis further noted \nthe beneficial energy and non-air quality environmental impacts of a 15 \nppm sulfur heating oil requirement and that reducing sulfur content may \nalso have a salutary impact on the remaining useful life of residential \nfurnaces and boilers.\\62\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\60\\ See Appendix L ``2016 Updates to the Assessment of \nReasonable Progress for Regional Haze in MANEVU Class I Areas.''\n    \\61\\ Id. at 8-7.\n    \\62\\ Id. at 8-8.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Vermont's limitations on sulfur in fuel took effect in two phases. \nThe first phase, which began in 2014, lowered the concentration of \nsulfur in No. 2 and lighter distillate fuels to 500 ppm by weight, \ndropping to 15 ppm by weight during the second phase which took effect \non July 1, 2018.\\63\\ The allowable concentration of sulfur in No. 4 \nresidual oils lowered to 2500ppm by weight during the second phase as \nwell.\\64\\ Additionally, Vermont limited the allowable concentration of \nsulfur in No. 5 and No. 6 residual oils, heavier residual oils, and \nused oils to 5000 ppm by weight.\\65\\ EPA approved Vermont's sulfur in \nfuel regulation into the SIP in 2012.\\66\\ EPA agrees that Vermont \nreasonably relied on MANEVU's four-factor analysis for a low-sulfur \nfuel oil regulation, which engaged with each of the statutory factors \nand explained how the information supported a conclusion that a 15 ppm-\nsulfur fuel oil standard for fuel oils is reasonable. Vermont's SIP-\napproved ultra-low sulfur fuel oil rule is consistent with Ask 3's \nsulfur content standards for the three types of fuel oils (distillate \noil, #4 residual oil, #6 residual oil) and more. EPA therefore agrees \nthat Vermont reasonably determined that it has satisfied Ask 3.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\63\\ VT APCR section 5-221(1)(a).\n    \\64\\ Id.\n    \\65\\ Id.\n    \\66\\ See 77 FR 30212.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Vermont concluded that no additional updates were needed to meet \nAsk 4, which requests that MANEVU states pursue updating permits, \nenforceable agreements, and/or rules to lock in lower emission rates \nfor sources larger than 250 MMBtu per hour that have switched to lower-\nemitting fuels. EPA acknowledges that Vermont does not contain any \nsources subject to this Ask.\n    Ask 5 addresses NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from peaking combustion \nturbines that have the potential to operate on high electric demand \ndays. Vermont identified the following combustion turbines in the State \nas meeting the criteria of this Ask: GMP gas turbines No. 5 (Berlin 5A \nand 5B), and GMP gas turbine No. 16 (Gorge 16). The Ask requests states \nto strive for certain NO<INF>X</INF> emission standards for such \nsources or to perform four-factor analyses for reasonable installation \nor upgrade to emission controls. Vermont has not adopted emission rules \nthat meet the stringency of item 5.a. of the Ask. Therefore, Vermont \nrequested four-factor analyses for Berlin 5A and 5B and Gorge 16. Each \ncombustion turbine is owned by Green Mountain Power, was originally \ninstalled around the same time (1964-1972), has a similar unit rating \n(334 MMBtu/hr-355.5 MMBtu/hr), and has NO<INF>X</INF> emissions ranging \nfrom 0.63 lbs/MMBtu to 0.88 lbs/MMBtu. The median annual NO<INF>X</INF> \nemissions for these sources were: GMP Berlin 5A--3.0 tons, GMP Berlin \n5B--2.8 tons, and GMP Gorge 16--2.9 tons. As discussed previously, \nwater injection (0.05 lb/MMBtu) was calculated to be the lowest-cost \ncontrol option, but VT DEC determined that, at $17,074 per ton of \nNO<INF>X</INF> controlled, it is not cost effective. Additionally, if \nemployed, this NO<INF>X</INF> control would yield an estimated 5 tons \nper year total reduction across all three units.\\67\\ Thus, in addition \nto not being cost effective, employing this additional control would \nhave only a very small impact on Vermont's annual NO<INF>X</INF> \nemissions. EPA agrees that Vermont reasonably concluded from the four-\nfactor analyses that additional NO<INF>X</INF> controls for these \nsources are not necessary for reasonable progress, and that Vermont has \nmet the requirements of Ask 5.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\67\\ See Appendix T ``Green Mountain Power, Regional Haze \nReasonable Progress Four-Factor Analysis'', Trinity Consultants, \nDecember 18, 2020.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Finally, with regard to Ask 6, Vermont described the State's \nstrategies to decrease air emissions by lowering energy demand via \nenergy efficiency and modernizing the electrical grid to handle \ndistributed energy resources, including in Vermont's Comprehensive \nEnergy Plan. The EPA agrees that Vermont has satisfied Ask 6's request \nto consider and report in its SIP measures or programs related to \nenergy efficiency, cogeneration, and other clean distributed generation \ntechnologies.\n    In sum, Vermont identified several mechanisms for controlling \npollutants that impair visibility--including its regulations limiting \nsulfur content in fuels (which are in Vermont's SIP), as\n\n[[Page 22045]]\n\nwell as the continued implementation of NO<INF>X</INF> RACT for point \nsources. EPA proposes to find that Vermont has reasonably concluded \nthat these measures are necessary to make reasonable progress for the \nsecond planning period.\n    In addition to these SIP-approved measures, Vermont also identified \nother federally enforceable and permanent controls, including its \nmobile source control measures, as key emission reduction strategies. \nOn-road mobile emissions reductions are due in part to Vermont's \nadoption of amendments to the Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero \nEmission Vehicle (ZEV) rules, which incorporate by reference \nCalifornia's motor vehicle emission standard regulations.\\68\\ These \nstandards ensure that vehicles sold in the state meet increasingly \nstringent emissions requirements through time. Vermont has also adopted \nCalifornia's Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, Low \nNO<INF>X</INF> Heavy-Duty Omnibus and the Phase 2 Greenhouse Gas \nrules.\\69\\ Other efforts to reduce air pollution from on-road mobile \nsources include adoption of inspection and maintenance of vehicle \nemissions control systems, enhancement of emissions control technology, \nupgrading programs for diesel engines, and participation in regional \nand state-specific efforts to build and incentivize zero emission \nvehicle infrastructure and ownership.\\70\\ Vermont states that it is \ncommitted to reducing mobile source emissions to reduce visibility \nimpairment, both in Vermont and in other impacted states.\\71\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\68\\ See <a href=\"https://dec.vermont.gov/air-quality/laws-and-regulations/recently-adopted-and-proposed-regulations\">https://dec.vermont.gov/air-quality/laws-and-regulations/recently-adopted-and-proposed-regulations</a>.\n    \\69\\ Id.\n    \\70\\ VT Regional Haze SIP Submission at 56.\n    \\71\\ Id. at 46.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    EPA is therefore proposing to find the state's approach meets the \nstatutory and regulatory requirements for several reasons. \nSpecifically, EPA is proposing to find--based on Vermont's \nparticipation in the MANEVU planning process, how it has addressed the \nAsks, and the EPA's assessment of Vermont's emissions and point \nsources--that Vermont has complied with the requirements of section \n51.308(f)(2)(i). Vermont's application of MANEVU Asks 3 and 5 engages \nwith the requirement that states evaluate and determine the emission \nreduction measures necessary to make reasonable progress by considering \nthe four statutory factors.\n    In determining the emissions reduction measures necessary to make \nreasonable progress, Vermont reasonably evaluated and explained its \ndecision to focus on SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> to address \nvisibility impairment within the MANEVU region. Vermont adequately \nsupported that decision through reasonable reliance on the MANEVU \ntechnical analyses cited in its submission. EPA notes that MANEVU \nconcluded that sulfates from SO<INF>2</INF> emissions were still the \nprimary driver of visibility impairment in the second implementation \nperiod and that MANEVU conducted a four-factor analysis (included with \nthe State's submittal) to support Ask 3, which addresses SO<INF>2</INF> \nemissions by requesting that states pursue ultra-low sulfur fuel oil \nstandards. Vermont's EPA-approved sulfur fuel oil rule is included in \nthe State's Long-Term Strategy and sets stringent limits for sulfur \ncontent and SO<INF>2</INF> emissions for fuels used for heating and \npower generation.\\72\\ Vermont's rule controls SO<INF>2</INF> emissions \nfrom area and point sources by limiting the sulfur content of No. 2 and \nlighter distillate oils to 0.0015% and the sulfur content of No. 4 \nresidual oil and No. 5 and 6 residual oils to 0.25% and 0.5%, \nrespectively.\\73\\ EPA previously approved these requirements into \nVermont's SIP,\\74\\ and they went into effect in July 2018.\\75\\ \nVermont's submittal also includes four-factor analyses for three \nNO<INF>X</INF> sources and demonstrates that these and other sources of \nSO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> within the state have very small \nemissions of NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF>, and are already subject \nto stringent emission control measures. For instance, while the state \ncontains no ozone nonattainment areas, Vermont nonetheless applies \nNO<INF>X</INF> RACT to certain sources owing to its location within the \nOzone Transport Region. EPA approved Vermont's latest NO<INF>X</INF> \nRACT rule in 2019, which has been employed on Vermont's highest \nNO<INF>X</INF> emitting point source, McNeil Generating Station, among \nothers. Vermont estimates point source emissions of NO<INF>X</INF> \namounted to only 2% of all NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the State.\\76\\ \nIn addition, and as noted earlier, Vermont estimates that its top five \nNO<INF>X</INF>-emitting point sources together accounted for only about \n330 tons of NO<INF>X</INF> per year on average, based on 2013-2017 \nemissions information.\\77\\ Similarly, NEI data indicate a steady \ndecline in point source emissions of NO<INF>X</INF> in Vermont, with \nthe 2017 NEI estimating point source NO<INF>X</INF> emissions at just \n393 tpy \\78\\ and the 2020 NEI at 330 tpy.\\79\\ Similarly, Vermont \nestimates its top five SO<INF>2</INF> emitting sources together \ncontributed a total of less than 100 tpy over the 2013-2017 period.\\80\\ \nAs discussed previously, continued implementation of federal mobile \nsource programs will provide further reductions in NO<INF>X</INF> \nemissions from Vermont. Moreover, EPA notes that the FLMs did not \nidentify any additional sources in Vermont for four-factor analysis or \nrequest any revisions or other analyses.\\81\\ In particular, the US \nForest Service--the FLM for the Class I areas most impacted by \nVermont--stated that it was ``satisfied'' with Vermont's plan and \noffered ``no suggestions for change.'' \\82\\ Similarly, the National \nPark Service commended Vermont on its draft submission and had ``no \nfurther comments at this time.'' \\83\\ In short, Vermont's \nSO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions are already quite low, are \ncontrolled by EPA-approved limits in the SIP (as a result of Regional \nHaze and other CAA requirements) and have overall small contributions \nto visibility impairment in Class I areas. In conclusion, the projected \n2028 visibility conditions for Class I areas influenced by emissions \nfrom Vermont sources are all below the URP, and EPA proposes to find \nthat Vermont's SIP submittal satisfies the requirements that states \ndetermine the emission reduction measures that are necessary to make \nreasonable progress by considering the four factors, and that their \nlong-term strategies include the enforceable emission limitations, \ncompliance schedules, and other measures necessary to make reasonable \nprogress.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\72\\ VT APCR 5-221(1).\n    \\73\\ Id.\n    \\74\\ See 77 FR 30212.\n    \\75\\ VT APCR 5-221(1).\n    \\76\\ VT Regional Haze SIP Submission at 46.\n    \\77\\ Id. at 47-48.\n    \\78\\ Id. at 62.\n    \\79\\ The final 2020 NEI is available here <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/2020-air-emissions-data\">https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/2020-air-emissions-data</a>.\n    \\80\\ VT Regional Haze SIP Submission at 62.\n    \\81\\ See Appendix X ``Federal Land Manger Responses.''\n    \\82\\ Id.\n    \\83\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nc. Additional Long-Term Strategy Requirements\n    The consultation requirements of section 51.308(f)(2)(ii) provide \nthat states must consult with other states that are reasonably \nanticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in a Class I area to \ndevelop coordinated emission management strategies containing the \nemission reductions necessary to make reasonable progress. Section \n51.308(f)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) respectively require states to include in \ntheir SIPs measures agreed to during state-to-state consultations or a \nregional planning process and to consider the\n\n[[Page 22046]]\n\nemission reduction measures identified by other states as necessary for \nreasonable progress. Section 51.308(f)(2)(ii)(C) speaks to what happens \nif states cannot agree on what measures are necessary to make \nreasonable progress.\n    Vermont participated in and provided documentation of the MANEVU \nintra- and inter-RPO consultation processes, which included consulting \nwith both MANEVU and non-MANEVU states about emissions reasonably \nanticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in Vermont's Class I \narea and emissions from Vermont reasonably anticipated to contribute to \nvisibility impairment in other Class I areas. The consultations \naddressed developing coordinated emission management strategies \ncontaining the emission reductions necessary to make reasonable \nprogress at the Class I areas. Vermont addressed impacts to the MANEVU \nClass I areas by providing information on the measures it has in place \nthat satisfy each MANEVU Ask.\\84\\ Vermont included in its Regional Haze \nSIP submittal all measures agreed to during state-to-state \nconsultations and emission reduction measures identified by other \nstates. While Vermont did not receive any comments from non-MANEVU \nstates during its public comment period to consider additional measures \nto address visibility impairment in Class I areas outside MANEVU, \nMANEVU documented issues some non-MANEVU states raised about MANEVU's \nanalyses during consultation. For instance, MANEVU noted in its \nConsultation Report that upwind states expressed concern regarding the \nanalyses the RPO used for the selection of states for the consultation. \nMANEVU agreed that these tools, as all models, have their limitations, \nbut nonetheless deemed them appropriate. Additionally, there were \nseveral comments regarding the choice of the 2011 modeling base year. \nMANEVU agreed that the choice of base year is critical to the outcome \nof the study. MANEVU acknowledged that there were newer versions of the \nemission inventories and the need to use the best available inventory \nfor each analysis. MANEVU, however, concluded that the selected \ninventories were appropriate for the analysis. Additionally, upwind \nstates noted that they would not be able to address the MANEVU Asks \nuntil they finalize their SIPs. MANEVU believed the assumption of the \nimplementation of the Asks from upwind states in its 2028 control case \nmodeling was reasonable, and Vermont included both the 2028 base case \nand control case modeling results in its SIP, representing visibility \nconditions at the Class 1 areas in the MANEVU States assuming upwind \nstates do not and do implement the Asks, respectively.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\84\\ See appendix G ``MANEVU Regional Haze Consultation Report \nand Consultation Documentation.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In sum, Vermont participated in the MANEVU intra- and inter-RPO \nconsultation and included in its SIP submittal the measures identified \nand agreed to during those consultations, thereby satisfying section \n51.308(f)(2)(ii)(A) and (B). Vermont satisfied section \n51.308(f)(2)(ii)(C) by participating in MANEVU's consultation process, \nwhich documented the disagreements between the upwind states and the \nMANEVU states and explained the latter's reasoning on each of the \ndisputed issues. Based on the entirety of MANEVU's intra- and inter-RPO \nconsultation, including the MANEVU responses to other states' concerns \nand various technical analyses in the SIP submission, we propose to \ndetermine that Vermont has satisfied the consultation requirements of \nsection 51.308(f)(2)(ii).\n    The documentation requirement of 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iii) provides \nthat states may meet their obligations to document the technical bases \non which they are relying to determine the emission reductions measures \nthat are necessary to make reasonable progress through an RPO, as long \nas the process has been ``approved by all State participants.'' As \nexplained above, Vermont chose to rely on MANEVU's technical \ninformation, modeling, and analysis to support development of its long-\nterm strategy. The MANEVU technical analyses on which Vermont relied \nare listed in the state's SIP submission and include source \ncontribution assessments, information on each of the four factors and \nvisibility modeling information for certain EGUs, and evaluations of \nemission reduction strategies for specific source categories. Vermont \nalso provided information to further demonstrate the technical bases \nand emission information it relied on to determine the emission \nreductions measures that are necessary to make reasonable progress. \nBased on the documentation provided by the state, we propose to find \nVermont satisfies the requirements of section 51.308(f)(2)(iii).\n    Section 51.308(f)(2)(iii) also requires that the emissions \ninformation considered to determine the measures that are necessary to \nmake reasonable progress include information on emissions for the most \nrecent year for which the state has submitted triennial emissions data \nto the EPA (or a more recent year), with a 12-month exemption period \nfor newly submitted data. Vermont drafted the plan using the 2017 \nNational Emissions Inventory (NEI). The SIP submission included 2017 \nNEI emission data for NO<INF>X</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, PM, VOCs and \nNH<INF>3</INF>. Additionally, Vermont relied on NO<INF>X</INF> \nemissions data through 2023 in its assessment of measures necessary for \nreasonable progress of Ask 5 sources as well as 2016-2019 Air Markets \nProgram Data (AMPD) emissions for NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF>. \nThough Vermont provided the section's analysis using 2017 NEI data, the \n2020 NEI shows a continued decline in Vermont's NO<INF>X</INF>, and VOC \npoint source emissions. Using 2020 NEI data would not have affected the \nState's source selection or analysis.\\85\\ For instance, NO<INF>X</INF> \npoint source emissions in Vermont totaled 393 tons in 2017 and were \nreduced to 330 tons in 2020. A portion of this reduction came from \nVermont's top NO<INF>X</INF> emitter, McNeil Station, with \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions falling from 133 tpy in 2017, to 118 tpy in \n2020. Additionally, SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from point sources did not \nincrease, and remained level from 2017 to 2020.Thus, based on Vermont's \nconsideration and analysis of the emission data in their submittal as \nwell as the 2020 NEI data for the state, EPA proposes to find that \nVermont has satisfied the emissions information requirement in \n51.308(f)(2)(iii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\85\\ The final 2020 NEI is available here <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/2020-air-emissions-data\">https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/2020-air-emissions-data</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    We also propose to find that Vermont reasonably considered the five \nadditional factors in section 51.308(f)(2)(iv) in developing its long-\nterm strategy. Pursuant to section 51.308(f)(2)(iv)(A), Vermont noted \nthat existing and ongoing state and federal emission control programs \nthat contribute to emission reductions through 2028 would impact \nemissions of visibility impairing pollutants from point and nonpoint \nsources in the second implementation period. Vermont included in its \nSIP a list of control measures with their effective dates, pollutants \naddressed, and corresponding State regulations.\\86\\ These measures \ninclude SIP approved revisions such as NO<INF>X</INF> RACT, which has \nbeen employed on the largest NO<INF>X</INF> emitter in the state, \nMcNeil Electric Generating Station, and requires the year-round use of \nSCR at that facility. Additionally, Vermont notes that its limitations \non sulfur in fuel address residential combustion of fuel oil, a \nsignificant contributor to SO<INF>2</INF> emissions\n\n[[Page 22047]]\n\nin the state. Additionally, as discussed previously, Vermont has \nadopted the California Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, \nLow NO<INF>X</INF> Heavy-Duty Omnibus and the Phase 2 Greenhouse Gas \nrules and recently amended its Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero \nEmission Vehicle (ZEV) rules, to remain consistent with California's \nmotor vehicle emission standards MANEVU modeling estimated that Vermont \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions from the mobile source sector contribute to \nVermont's impact to visibility impairment at New Hampshire's Class I \nareas, and Vermont's adoption of these rules should address some of \nthat impact.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\86\\ See Section 5.7 of the VT Regional Haze SIP Submission.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Vermont's consideration of measures to mitigate the impacts of \nconstruction activities as required by section51.308(f)(2)(iv)(B) \nincludes recognition that federal regulations require the reduction of \nSO<INF>2</INF> from construction vehicles and that crustal material \nplays a very small role in visibility impairment in Lye Brook \nWilderness. For these reasons, Vermont deferred evaluation of further \ncontrols to mitigate the impacts of construction activities.\n    Pursuant to section 51.308(f)(2)(iv)(C), Vermont noted that while \nany source retirements or replacements will result in local benefits, \nany resultant emissions reductions will not have a significant impact \non Class I areas in MANEVU given the state's already small amount of \npoint source emissions.\n    In considering smoke management as required in 40 CFR \n51.308(f)(2)(iv)(D), Vermont explained that fine particulate matter \nassociated with wood smoke in the State comes largely from residential \nand industrial/commercial/institutional wood combustion, as well as \nopen burning. Currently, Lye Brook Wilderness and other MANEVU Class I \nareas are impacted most by wildfire smoke emissions from other regions, \nsuch as the numerous western and Canadian wildfires. Vermont stated \nthat it will continue to review the impacts of fine particulate matter \nfrom agricultural use of fire and prescribed fire for forest and \necosystem management and that, if the impacts become important in \nmaintaining reasonable progress, future revisions to the SIP will \ninclude a smoke management plan. Additionally, Vermont will continue to \nconsult with the U.S. Forest Service regarding potential impacts of \nprescribed fire on visibility in the Lye Brook Wilderness.\n    Vermont considered the anticipated net effect of projected changes \nin emissions as required by 51.308(f)(2)(iv)(E) by discussing the new \nmobile source regulations and The Global Warming Solutions Act. Vermont \nanticipates, as the mobile source regulations go into effect, that \nemissions of NO<INF>X</INF> will decrease by 2028. In addition, The \nGlobal Warming Solutions will impact emissions from area sources. \nTogether, these reductions will provide further progress in improving \nvisibility in downwind states.\n    Because Vermont has reasonably considered each of the five \nadditional factors, the EPA proposes to find that Vermont has satisfied \nthe requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(f)(2)(iv).\n\nF. Reasonable Progress Goals\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(3) contains the requirements pertaining to RPGs \nfor each Class I area. Because Vermont is host to a Class I area, it is \nsubject to both section 51.308(f)(3)(i) and, potentially, (ii). Section \n51.308(f)(3)(i) requires a state in which a Class I area is located to \nestablish RPGs--one each for the most impaired and clearest days--\nreflecting the visibility conditions that will be achieved at the end \nof the implementation period as a result of the emission limitations, \ncompliance schedules and other measures required under paragraph (f)(2) \nto be in states' long-term strategies, as well as implementation of \nother CAA requirements. The long-term strategies as reflected by the \nRPGs must provide for an improvement in visibility on the most impaired \ndays relative to the baseline period and ensure no degradation on the \nclearest days relative to the baseline period. Section 51.308(f)(3)(ii) \napplies in circumstances in which a Class I area's RPG for the most \nimpaired days represents a slower rate of visibility improvement than \nthe uniform rate of progress calculated under 40 CFR 51.308(f)(1)(vi). \nUnder section 51.308(f)(3)(ii)(A), if the state in which a mandatory \nClass I area is located establishes an RPG for the most impaired days \nthat provides for a slower rate of visibility improvement than the URP, \nthe state must demonstrate that there are no additional emission \nreduction measures for anthropogenic sources or groups of sources in \nthe state that would be reasonable to include in its long-term \nstrategy. Section 51.308(f)(3)(ii)(B) requires that if a state contains \nsources that are reasonably anticipated to contribute to visibility \nimpairment in a Class I area in another state, and the RPG for the most \nimpaired days in that Class I area is above the URP, the upwind state \nmust provide the same demonstration.\n    Table 6-1 of Vermont's SIP submittal summarizes baseline visibility \nconditions (i.e., visibility conditions during the baseline period of \n2000-2004) for the most impaired and clearest days and the 2028 RPG for \nthe most impaired days for Vermont's Class I areas, as well as \ninformation on natural visibility conditions, the rate of progress \ndescribed by the URP in 2028, and the modeled 2028 base case \n(representing visibility conditions in 2028 with existing controls). \nBaseline visibility conditions at Vermont's Class I areas were 6.37 and \n23.57 deciviews for the clearest and most impaired days, respectively. \nBy comparison, Vermont has established 2028 RPGs for the clearest and \nmost impaired days of 3.90 and 13.89 deciviews.\\87\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\87\\ See Table 8-1 of the VT Regional Haze SIP Submission. These \nvalues were modeled not including the MANEVU Asks. EPA supports \nthese values as the 2028 RPGs. The values for the clearest and most \nimpaired days including the Asks were 3.86 and 13.68 deciviews, \nrespectively.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Vermont's 2028 most impaired base case of 13.89 deciviews reflects \nthe visibility conditions that are projected to be achieved based on \nstates' existing measures. As such, EPA was considers the 2028 modeled \nbase case value of 13.89 deciviews to be the appropriate estimate of \nthe RPG for the 20% most impaired visibility days (as opposed to the \n13.68 deciviews value that includes measures from the MANEVU Asks). EPA \nexpects that the observed deciview value in 2028 will be equal to or \nlower than the 13.89 deciview estimate. Even the conservative estimate \nof 13.89 deciviews on the most impaired days in 2028 constitutes \nimprovement over the baseline visibility conditions of 23.57 deciviews. \nTherefore, the long-term strategy and the reasonable progress goals \nprovide for an improvement in visibility for the most impaired days \nsince the baseline period and ensure no degradation in visibility for \nthe clearest days since the baseline period. 40 CFR 51.308(f)(3)(i).\n    As noted in the RHR at 40 CFR 51.308(f)(3)(iii), the reasonable \nprogress goals are not directly enforceable but will be considered by \nthe Administrator in evaluating the adequacy of the measures in the \nimplementation plan in providing for reasonable progress towards \nachieving natural visibility conditions at that area. The 2028 RPG for \nthe most impaired days of 13.89 deciviews fulfills the regulatory \npurpose of the RPGs because visibility conditions at Vermont's Class I \narea have improved since the baseline period. EPA is therefore \nproposing to find that Vermont's RPGs satisfy the applicable \nrequirements and provide for reasonable progress towards achieving \nnatural conditions.\n    Table 6-1 of Vermont's submission shows the URP glidepath value for\n\n[[Page 22048]]\n\nVermont's Class I area in 2028 as 18.24 deciviews. Vermont's RPG is \nwell below the glidepath value. Therefore, the demonstration \nrequirement under section 51.308(f)(3)(ii)(A) is not triggered. Nor has \nthe demonstration requirement under section 51.308(f)(3)(ii)(B) been \ntriggered. Under paragraph (B), a state that contains sources that are \nreasonably anticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in a \nClass I area in another state for which a demonstration by the other \nstate is required under 51.308(f)(3)(ii)(A) must demonstrate that there \nare no additional emission reduction measures that would be reasonable \nto include in its long-term strategy. Vermont's SIP revision included \nthe modeled MANEVU 2028 visibility projections at nearby Class I \nareas.\\88\\ While these projections may not represent the final RPGs for \nthese Class I areas, all of the base case 2028 projections for the most \nimpaired days at these areas (Acadia, Brigantine, Campobello, Lye \nBrook, Moosehorn, Dolly Sods, James River Face, Otter Creek, and \nShenandoah) are well below the respective 2028 points on the URPs. \nTherefore, we propose it is reasonable to assume that the demonstration \nrequirement under section 51.308(f)(3)(ii)(B) as it pertains to these \nareas will not be triggered for Vermont. We propose to find that \nVermont has satisfied (f)(3).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\88\\ See Appendix B ``Mid-Atlantic/Northeast U.S. Visibility \nData 2004-2019 (2nd RH SIP Metrics)''.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nG. Monitoring Strategy and Other Implementation Plan Requirements\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(6) specifies that each comprehensive revision of \na state's regional haze SIP must contain or provide for certain \nelements, including monitoring strategies, emissions inventories, and \nany reporting, recordkeeping and other measures needed to assess and \nreport on visibility. A main requirement of this subsection is for \nstates with Class I areas to submit monitoring strategies for \nmeasuring, characterizing, and reporting on visibility impairment. \nCompliance with this requirement may be met through participation in \nthe Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) \nnetwork.\n    The IMPROVE monitor for the Lye Brook Wilderness, indicated as \nLYEB1 in the IMPROVE monitoring network database, is located on the \nnorthern slope of Mount Snow. The monitor site lies in West Dover, \nVermont, near Lye Brook, at elevation 1093 meters, latitude 42.57[deg], \nand longitude -72.54[deg]. This monitor is operated and maintained by \nthe U.S. Forest Service.\\89\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\89\\ See Vermont's 2023 Annual Network Plan which can be found \nin the docket of this proposed rulemaking.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(6)(i) requires SIPs to provide for the \nestablishment of any additional monitoring sites or equipment needed to \nassess whether reasonable progress goals to address regional haze for \nall mandatory Class I Federal areas within the state are being \nachieved. Vermont has not received any recommendations or advice from \nEPA or the U.S. Forest Service that additional monitoring is required \npursuant to 40 CFR 51.308(f)(4). Therefore, Vermont has no current \nplans to alter the current strategy as long as this monitoring \ncontinues to be federally supported.\n    Section 51.308(f)(6)(ii) requires SIPs to provide for procedures by \nwhich monitoring data and other information are used in determining the \ncontribution of emissions from within the state to regional haze \nvisibility impairment at mandatory Class I Federal areas both within \nand outside the state. Vermont relied on the MANEVU contribution \nassessment analysis.\\90\\ The analysis included Eulerian (grid-based) \nsource models, Lagrangian (air parcel-based) source dispersion models, \nas well as a variety of data analysis techniques that include source \napportionment models, back trajectory calculations, and the use of \nmonitoring and inventory data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\90\\ See appendix G ``MANEVU Regional Haze Consultation Report \nand Consultation Documentation.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(6)(iii) does not apply to Vermont, as it has a \nClass I area within its borders.\n    Section 51.308(f)(6)(iv) requires the SIP to provide for the \nreporting of all visibility monitoring data to the Administrator at \nleast annually for each Class I area in the state. As noted above, the \nLye Brook Wilderness IMPROVE monitor is operated and maintained by the \nU.S. Forest Service. The monitoring strategy for Vermont relies upon \nthe continued availability of the IMPROVE network. Thus, Vermont \nsupports the continued operation of the IMPROVE network through both \nstate and Federal funding mechanisms.\n    Section 51.308(f)(6)(v) requires SIPs to provide for a statewide \ninventory of emissions of pollutants that are reasonably anticipated to \ncause or contribute to visibility impairment, including emissions for \nthe most recent year for which data are available and estimates of \nfuture projected emissions. It also requires a commitment to update the \ninventory periodically. Vermont provides for emissions inventories and \nestimates for future projected emissions by participating in the MANEVU \nRPO and complying with EPA's Air Emissions Reporting Rule (AERR). In 40 \nCFR part 51, subpart A, the AERR requires states to submit updated \nemissions inventories for criteria pollutants to EPA's Emissions \nInventory System (EIS) every three years. The emission inventory data \nare used to develop the NEI, which provides for, among other things, a \ntriennial state-wide inventory of pollutants that are reasonably \nanticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment.\n    Section 8 of Vermont's submission includes tables of NEI data. The \nsource categories of the emissions inventories included are: (1) Point \nsources, (2) nonpoint sources, (3) non-road mobile sources, and (4) on-\nroad mobile sources. The point source category is further divided into \nAir Markets Program Data (AMPD) point sources and non-AMPD point \nsources.\\91\\ Vermont included NEI emissions inventories for the \nfollowing years: 2002 (one of the regional haze program baseline \nyears), 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017; and for the following pollutants: \nSO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF>, PM<INF>10</INF>, PM 2.5, VOCs, CO, and \nNH3. Vermont also provided a summary of SO<INF>2</INF> and \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions for AMPD sources for the years of 2016, 2017, \n2018, and 2019. Consideration of 2020 NEI data shows level and \ndeclining point source emissions of SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> \nrespectively and would not have affected the State's source selection \nor analysis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\91\\ AMPD sources are facilities that participate in EPA's \nemission trading programs. The majority of AMPD sources are electric \ngenerating units (EGUs).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(6)(v) also requires states to include estimates \nof future projected emissions and include a commitment to update the \ninventory periodically. Vermont relied on the MANEVU 2028 emissions \nprojections for MANEVU states. MANEVU completed two 2028 projected \nemissions modeling cases--a 2028 base case that considers only on-the-\nbooks controls and a 2028 control case that considers implementation of \nthe MANEVU Asks.\\92\\ Vermont's SIP submittal also includes a commitment \nto update the statewide emissions inventory periodically.\\93\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\92\\ See ``OTC MANEVU 2011 Based Modeling Platform Support \nDocument October 2018--Final.'' Which can be found in the docket of \nthis proposed rulemaking.\n    \\93\\ See VT Regional Haze SIP Submission at 82.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The EPA proposes to find that Vermont has met the requirements of \n40 CFR 51.308(f)(6) as described above, including through its continued \nparticipation in the IMPROVE network and the MANEVU RPO and its on-\ngoing compliance with the AERR, and that no\n\n[[Page 22049]]\n\nfurther elements are necessary at this time for Vermont to assess and \nreport on visibility pursuant to 40 CFR 51.308(f)(6)(vi).\n\nH. Requirements for Periodic Reports Describing Progress Towards the \nReasonable Progress Goals\n\n    Section 51.308(f)(5) requires that periodic comprehensive revisions \nof states' regional haze plans also address the progress report \nrequirements of 40 CFR 51.308(g)(1) through (5). The purpose of these \nrequirements is to evaluate progress towards the applicable RPGs for \neach Class I area within the state and each Class I area outside the \nstate that may be affected by emissions from within that state. \nSections 51.308(g)(1) and (2) apply to all states and require a \ndescription of the status of implementation of all measures included in \na state's first implementation period regional haze plan and a summary \nof the emission reductions achieved through implementation of those \nmeasures. Section 51.308(g)(3) applies only to states with Class I \nareas within their borders and requires such states to assess current \nvisibility conditions, changes in visibility relative to baseline \n(2000-2004) visibility conditions, and changes in visibility conditions \nrelative to the period addressed in the first implementation period \nprogress report. Section 51.308(g)(4) applies to all states and \nrequires an analysis tracking changes in emissions of pollutants \ncontributing to visibility impairment from all sources and sectors \nsince the period addressed by the first implementation period progress \nreport. This provision further specifies the year or years through \nwhich the analysis must extend depending on the type of source and the \nplatform through which its emission information is reported. Finally, \n40 CFR 51.308(g)(5), which also applies to all states, requires an \nassessment of any significant changes in anthropogenic emissions within \nor outside the state that have occurred since the period addressed by \nthe first implementation period progress report, including whether such \nchanges were anticipated and whether they have limited or impeded \nexpected progress towards reducing emissions and improving visibility.\n    Vermont's submission describes the status of measures of the long-\nterm strategy from the first implementation period. As a member of \nMANEVU, Vermont considered the MANEVU Asks and adopted corresponding \nmeasures into its long-term strategy for the first implementation \nperiod. The MANEVU Asks were: (1) Timely implementation of Best \nAvailable Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements; (2) EGU controls \nincluding Controls at 167 Key Sources that most affect MANEVU Class I \nareas; (3) Low sulfur fuel oil strategy; and (4) Continued evaluation \nof other control measures. Vermont met all the identified reasonable \nmeasures requested during the first implementation period. During the \nfirst planning period for regional haze, programs that were put in \nplace focused on reducing sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) emissions. \nThe reductions achieved led to vast improvements in visibility at the \nMANEVU Federal Class I Areas due to reduced sulfates formed from \nSO<INF>2</INF> emissions. Vermont lists in its submission an expansive \nlist of control measures that help control the emissions of VOCs, \nNO<INF>X</INF>, PM and SO<INF>2</INF> from a wide range of sources.\\94\\ \nVermont's SIP submission includes emission data demonstrating the \nreductions achieved throughout the state through implementation of the \nmeasures mentioned. The state included periodic emission data that \ndemonstrate a decrease in VOCs, NO<INF>X</INF>, PM and SO<INF>2</INF> \nemissions throughout the state.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\94\\ See Section 8.2 of the VT Regional Haze SIP Submission.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The EPA proposes to find that Vermont has met the requirements of \n40 CFR 51.308(g)(1) and (2) because its SIP submission describes the \nmeasures included in the long-term strategy from the first \nimplementation period, as well as the status of their implementation \nand the emission reductions achieved through such implementation.\n    Vermont's SIP submission includes the assessments of visibility \nconditions and changes at the State's class I areas, expressed in terms \nof 5-year averages, required by section 51.308(g)(3). In particular, \nVermont's submission reports current (2015-2019) visibility conditions \nfor the most impaired and clearest days of 14.06 and 4.88 deciviews, \nrespectively, indicating that haze index levels have decreased by 9.51 \ndeciviews on the most impaired days and 1.49 deciviews on the clearest \ndays from baseline visibility conditions (2000-2004).\\95\\ The SIP \nsubmission also indicates that, since the period addressed in Vermont's \nprevious progress report (2010-2014), haze index levels have decreased \nby 4.44 and 0.22 deciviews on the most impaired and clearest days, \nrespectively. EPA therefore proposes to find that Vermont has satisfied \nthe requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(g)(3).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\95\\ Id. at Section 8.3.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to section 51.308(g)(4), Vermont provided a summary of \nemissions of NO<INF>X</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, PM<INF>10</INF>, \nPM<INF>2.5</INF>, VOCs, and NH3 from all sources and activities, \nincluding from point, nonpoint, non-road mobile, and on-road mobile \nsources, for the time period from 2002 to 2017, based on emission \ninventory information submitted pursuant to the AERR in 40 CFR part 51, \nsubpart A. With respect to sources that report directly to the EPA, \nVermont also included AMPD data for SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> \nemissions for 2016 through 2019.\n    The reductions achieved by Vermont's emission control measures are \nseen in the emissions inventory. Based on Vermont's SIP submission, \nNO<INF>X</INF> emissions have continuously declined in Vermont from \n2002 through 2017, especially in the onroad mobile sector. Vermont \nconsiders its mobile source emission reduction strategies as the most \nviable way to reduce NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the state that may be \nimpacting New Hampshire's Class I area. As discussed previously, \nVermont's adoption of California standards for on-road vehicles drives \nemissions reductions in the on- road sector. Initiatives in Vermont to \nreduce on-road NO<INF>X</INF> emissions include projects using the \nfunding from the Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation trust such as a \npilot project for electrifying school and transit buses, the \ninstallation of electric vehicle supply equipment to help support and \naccelerate electric vehicle adoption, and several ongoing heavy-duty \nvehicle electrification projects. Additionally, there are a wide range \nof federal rules which reduce emissions from non-road vehicles and \nequipment.\\96\\ NO<INF>X</INF> emissions are expected to continue to \ndecrease as fleet turnover occurs and the older more polluting vehicles \nand equipment are replaced by newer, cleaner ones. Vermont sources that \nreport to the EPA's AMPD showed a decline in NO<INF>X</INF> emissions \nin the period since the last progress report (167 tons in 2016 and 133 \ntons in 2019).\\97\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\96\\ See 69 FR 38958 (June 29, 2004), 73 FR 37096 (June 30, \n2008), 73 FR 59034 (October 8, 2008)\n    \\97\\ See VT Regional Haze SIP Submission at Figure 8-5 \n``NO<INF>X</INF> Emissions for all Data Categories, 2002-2017 (tpy) \nin Vermont'', and Figure 8-8: ``NO<INF>X</INF> Emissions from AMPD \nsources in MANEVU States, 2016-2019 (tpy).''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Emissions of SO<INF>2</INF> have shown a steady significant decline \nin Vermont over the period 2002 to 2017, across all sectors. Large \ndecreases are attributable to Vermont's adoption of the MANEVU low \nsulfur fuel strategy.\\98\\ Since some components of the low sulfur fuel \nstrategy have milestones of 2014, 2016 and 2018, and as MANEVU states \ncontinue to adopt rules to implement\n\n[[Page 22050]]\n\nthe strategy, additional SO<INF>2</INF> emissions reductions have \nlikely been obtained since 2017 and are expected to continue into the \nfuture. Other SO<INF>2</INF> emissions decreases are due to fuel \nswitching due to the availability of less expensive natural gas in \nrecent years, and source shutdowns.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\98\\ Id. at 72 (Figure 8-16); see also id. at 55-56.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Vermont's submission analyzes the change in PM<INF>10</INF> \nemissions from all NEI point, nonpoint, non-road, and onroad data \ncategories in Vermont, noting that PM<INF>10</INF> emissions have \nsteadily declined, particularly between the 2002 inventory to the 2014 \ninventory.\\99\\ However, the 2017 inventory shows an increase in \nPM<INF>10</INF> emissions. Vermont attributes this increase to the \nunpaved road dust sector, where the calculation methodology related to \nthe allocation of vehicle miles travelled (VMT) to unpaved roads used \nfor the 2017 inventory differed from what was used for the 2014 \ninventory. Vermont's 2017 inventory reports that the second largest \nPM<INF>10</INF> source in the state, emissions from residential wood \ncombustion, actually declined.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\99\\ Id. at 67 (Figure 8-10).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Vermont also analyzes PM<INF>2.5</INF> emissions from all NEI data \ncategories for the period from 2002 to 2017, noting that they have \nsteadily decreased in Vermont.\\100\\ Overall, there is a minor decrease \nreported from 2002 to 2017 in PM<INF>2.5</INF> emissions across all NEI \ncategories due to Federal and State regulations. Particulate matter \nemissions are difficult to determine a reliable trend for, due to \nchanges in methodology between inventories and the uncertainty with \nvehicle miles traveled data and residential wood combustion estimates. \nFor these reasons, there is significant variation in both particulate \nmatter estimates in the emission inventories.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\100\\ Id. at 69 (Figure 8-13).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Figure 8-21 of Vermont's submission shows VOC emissions from all \nNEI data categories for the period 2002 to 2017 in Vermont. VOC \nemissions have shown a decline in the state over this time period. \nHowever, the sharp decline in nonpoint VOC since 2002 is partly \nattributable to revised methodology for residential wood combustion, \nresulting in an overstated decrease. Much of the reduction seen in the \nnonroad sector for 2017 is likely attributable to changes in \nmethodology, incorporation of the EPA MOVES model between the 2014 and \n2017 NEIs, as well as updated vehicle populations and emission factors. \nVOC emissions from non-road and on-road mobile sources are expected to \ncontinue to decrease as older, more polluting vehicles are replaced by \nnewer, cleaner ones.\n    Figure 8-24 of Vermont's submission shows ammonia (NH<INF>3</INF>) \nemissions from all NEI data categories for the period 2002 to 2017. The \nfigure displays a general downward trend in Vermont, with some year-to-\nyear variability. The figure displays a sharp reduction in ammonia \nemissions in 2014. This rapid decline could be due to changes in the \ncalculation methodology for agricultural livestock waste, which is the \nlargest contributor to ammonia emissions. Further decreases in ammonia \nemissions were achieved in the onroad sectors due to federal engine \nstandards for vehicles and equipment. For many MANEVU states, ammonia \nemissions for 2014 and 2017 are lower than they were for earlier years. \nVermont, like most MANEVU states, saw increases in 2017 relative to \n2014, which Vermont states could likely be the result of estimation \nmethodology changes. Emissions from 2002-2008 are not comparable to \npost-2008 emissions due to methodology changes.\n    The EPA is proposing to find that Vermont has satisfied the \nrequirements of section 51.308(g)(4) by providing emissions information \nfor NO<INF>X</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, PM<INF>10</INF>, PM<INF>2.5</INF>, \nVOCs, and NH3 broken down by type of source.\n    The emissions trend data in the SIP submission \\101\\ support \nVermont's assessment that no significant increase of haze-causing \npollutant emissions has occurred in the state during the reporting \nperiod and that changes in emissions have not limited or impeded \nprogress in reducing pollutant emissions and improving visibility. \nVermont notes that, both within and outside the State, there has been a \nshift to cleaner generation of electricity using natural gas in place \nof fuels such as coal or oil that has contributed to reduced emissions \nof haze-causing pollutants. The EPA is proposing to find that Vermont \nhas met the requirements of section 51.308(g)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\101\\ Id. at Section 8 ``Progress Report and Periodic Reports.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. Requirements for State and Federal Land Manager Coordination\n\n    Section 169A(d) of the Clean Air Act requires states to consult \nwith FLMs before holding the public hearing on a proposed regional haze \nSIP, and to include a summary of the FLMs' conclusions and \nrecommendations in the notice to the public. In addition, section \n51.308(i)(2)'s FLM consultation provision requires a state to provide \nFLMs with an opportunity for consultation that is early enough in the \nstate's policy analyses of its emission reduction obligation so that \ninformation and recommendations provided by the FLMs can meaningfully \ninform the state's decisions on its long-term strategy. If the \nconsultation has taken place at least 120 days before a public hearing \nor public comment period, the opportunity for consultation will be \ndeemed early enough. Regardless, the opportunity for consultation must \nbe provided at least sixty days before a public hearing or public \ncomment period at the state level. Section 51.308(i)(2) further \nprovides that FLMs must be given an opportunity to discuss their \nassessment of visibility impairment in any Class I area and their \nrecommendations on the development and implementation of strategies to \naddress visibility impairment. Section 51.308(i)(3) requires states, in \ndeveloping their implementation plans, to include a description of how \nthey addressed FLMs' comments.\n    The states in the MANEVU RPO conducted FLM consultation early in \nthe planning process concurrent with the state-to-state consultation \nthat formed the basis of the RPO's decision making process. As part of \nthe consultation, the FLMs were given the opportunity to review and \ncomment on the technical documents developed by MANE-VU. The FLMs were \ninvited to attend the intra- and inter-RPO consultations calls among \nstates and at least one FLM representative was documented to have \nattended seven intra-RPO meetings and all inter-RPO meetings. Vermont \nparticipated in these consultation meetings and calls.\\102\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\102\\ See Appendix G ``MANEVU Regional Haze Consultation Report \nand Consultation Documentation.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    As part of this early engagement with the FLMs, on April 12, 2018, \nthe U.S. National Park Service (NPS) sent letters to the MANEVU states \nrequesting that they consider specific individual sources in their \nlong-term strategies.\\103\\ NPS used an analysis of emissions divided by \ndistance (Q/d) to estimate the impact of MANEVU facilities. To select \nthe facilities, NPS first summed 2014 NEI NO<INF>X</INF>, \nPM<INF>10</INF>, SO<INF>2</INF>, and SO4 emissions and divided by the \ndistance to a specified NPS mandatory Class I Federal area. NPS summed \nthe Q/d values across all MANEVU states relative to Acadia, Mammoth \nCave and Shenandoah National Parks, ranked the Q/d values relative to \neach Class I area, created a running total, and identified those \nfacilities contributing to 80% of the total impact at each NPS Class I \narea. NPS merged the resulting lists of\n\n[[Page 22051]]\n\nfacilities and sorted them by their states. NPS suggested that a state \nconsider those facilities comprising 80% of the Q/d total, not to \nexceed the 25 top ranked facilities. The NPS did not identify any \nfacilities in Vermont in this letter.\\104\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\103\\ Id.\n    \\104\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On October 11, 2022, the NPS sent a summary of their review of the \ndraft Regional Haze SIP via email, stating that the NPS ``commend[s] \nVermont for doing a good job outlining and incorporating the technical \nanalyses produced by MANE-VU'' and that ``NPS has no further comments \nat this time.'' \\105\\ On September 20, 2022, the U.S. Forest Service \nindicated by letter that it was ``satisfied with the document as \nprovided and offer[ed] no suggestions for change.'' \\106\\ In accordance \nwith CAA section 169A(d) and 40 CFR 51.308(i)(3), Vermont included \nsummaries of the consultation and copies of the FLM correspondence in \nappendices G and X of the SIP submission.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\105\\ See Appendix X ``Federal Land Manager Responses''.\n    \\106\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Vermont held a public comment period and public hearing for this \nRegional Haze SIP Revision. On April 19, 2024, VT DEC published a \nnotice in the Vermont Environmental Notice Bulletin announcing the \npublic hearing and the opportunity to submit written comments on the \nSIP revision until June 1, 2024.\\107\\ EPA provided written comments on \nMay 30, 2024.\\108\\ Vermont did not receive any other comments.\\109\\ VT \nDEC held a public hearing in Montpelier, VT on May 22, 2024.\\110\\ No \none attended the meeting.\\111\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\107\\ See VT DEC, ``Notice of Intent to submit the State \nImplementation Plan for Regional Haze Second Implementation \nPeriod.''\n    \\108\\ See Appendix Y ``EPA Comments for Vermont Proposed \nRegional Haze State Implementation Plan.''\n    \\109\\ See Section 10 of the VT Regional Haze SIP Submission.\n    \\110\\ Id.\n    \\111\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For the reasons stated above, the EPA proposes to find that Vermont \nhas satisfied the requirements under CAA section 169A(d) and 40 CFR \n51.308(i) regarding consultation with the FLMs on its regional haze SIP \nfor the second implementation period.\n\nJ. Other Required Commitments\n\n    Vermont's July 1, 2024, SIP submission includes a commitment to \nrevise and submit a subsequent regional haze SIP when due. The state's \ncommitment includes submitting periodic progress reports in accordance \nwith section 51.308(f) and a commitment to evaluate progress towards \nthe reasonable progress goal for each mandatory Class I Federal area \nlocated within the state and in each mandatory Class I Federal area \nlocated outside the state that may be affected by emissions from within \nthe state in accordance with section 51.308(g).\\112\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\112\\ Id. at Section 1.2.3 and Section 8.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nV. Proposed Action\n\n    The EPA is proposing to approve Vermont's July 1, 2024, SIP \nsubmission as satisfying the regional haze requirements for the second \nimplementation period contained in 40 CFR 51.308(f).\n\nVI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\n\n    Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a \nSIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and \napplicable Federal regulations. See 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). \nThus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state \nchoices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. \nAccordingly, this proposed action merely approves state law as meeting \nFederal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond \nthose imposed by state law. For that reason, this proposed action:\n    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review \nby the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 \nFR 51735, October 4, 1993);\n    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, \nFebruary 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under \nExecutive Order 12866;\n    <bullet> Does not impose an information collection burden under the \nprovisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);\n    <bullet> Is certified as not having a significant economic impact \non a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);\n    <bullet> Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or \nuniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);\n    <bullet> Does not have federalism implications as specified in \nExecutive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);\n    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, \nApril 23, 1997) because it approves a state program;\n    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to \nExecutive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and\n    <bullet> Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the \nNational Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 \nnote) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent \nwith the Clean Air Act.\n    In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian \nreservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has \ndemonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian \ncountry, the rule does not have tribal implications and will not impose \nsubstantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as \nspecified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).\n\nList of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52\n\n    Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Incorporation by \nreference, Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone, Particulate matter, Sulfur oxides.\n\n    Dated: May 14, 2025.\nMark Sanborn,\nRegional Administrator, EPA Region 1.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09274 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6560-50-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Background\nII. Evaluation of Revisions\nIII. Proposed Action\nIV. Incorporation by Reference\nV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\n\nI. Background\n\n    Each State has a Clean Air Act (CAA) State Implementation Plan \n(SIP), containing control measures and strategies used to attain and \nmaintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) established \nfor the criteria pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, \nozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide). The SIP contains such \nelements as air pollution control regulations, emission inventories, \nattainment demonstrations, and enforcement mechanisms. The SIP is a \ncompilation of these elements and is revised and updated by a State \nover time to keep address updates to Federal requirements and changing \nair quality issues or regulations in that State.\n    The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) implements \nand enforces the Oregon SIP through rules set out in Chapter 340 of the \nOregon Administrative Rules (OAR), Divisions 200 to 268. These rules \napply in all areas of the State, except where the Oregon Environmental \nQuality Commission (EQC) has designated Lane Regional Air Protection \nAgency (LRAPA) to administer rules within its area of jurisdiction.\n    LRAPA has been designated by the EQC to implement and enforce State \nrules in Lane County, and to adopt local rules that apply within Lane \nCounty. LRAPA may promulgate a local rule in lieu of a State rule \nprovided: (1) it is as strict as the corresponding State rule; and (2) \nit has been submitted to and approved by the EQC. This delegation of \nauthority to LRAPA in the Oregon SIP is consistent with CAA section \n110(a)(2)(E) requirements for State and local air agencies.\n    On July 1, 2024, the ODEQ and LRAPA submitted revisions to the \nOregon SIP as it applies in Lane County. These changes include updates \nto the LRAPA section 47-015(2) outdoor burning rule to expand the \noutdoor burning season in the city of Lowell (which is located in the \nEugene-Springfield metropolitan statistical area), updates and \nrevisions to definitions in section 47-010, and revisions to formatting \nthroughout section 47-001, section 47-005, section 47-010, section 47-\n015, and section 47-020.\n\nII. Evaluation of Revisions\n\nMinor Administrative Revisions\n\n    LRAPA revised sections 47-001 ``General Policy'', 47-005 \n``Exemptions from LRAPA Title 47'', 47-010 ``Definitions'', and 47-020 \n``Letter Permits'' with non-substantive formatting changes, such as \ncorrecting capitalization and using abbreviations. LRAPA also added \nfive terms to 47-010 ``Definitions'' and revised one term. Finally, \nLRAPA updated section 47-015 ``Residential Outdoor Burning \nRequirements'' to expand the outdoor burning season within the city \nlimits of Lowell. These substantive changes are described further in \nthe following paragraphs of this preamble.\n\nDefinitions\n\n    LRAPA revised section 47-010 ``Definitions'' to include terms used \nwithin LRAPA's existing title 47 that were not previously defined or to \nadd non-substantive formatting changes to current definitions. Added \ndefinitions include section 47-010(1) ``Agricultural burning for \ndisease or pest control'', section 47-010(5) ``Animal disease \nemergency'', section 47-010(7) ``Burn barrel'', section 47-010(12) \n``Fire hazard'', and section 47-010(15) ``Hazard to public safety''. \nSection 47-010(17) includes revisions to clarify what material \ngenerated by land clearing is considered demolition waste. Section 47-\n010(20) clarifies language on incinerators that do not have emission \nlimitations specified in title 30 by removing an unnecessary reference \nto another regulation that has its own applicability outside of title \n47 to limit any potential confusion.\n\nResidential Outdoor Burning Requirements\n\n    Revisions to section 47-015 include non-substantive formatting \nrevisions. The substantive revisions to section 47-015(2) include the \naddition of the City of Lowell to the list of cities in section 47-\n015(2)(g) that may conduct certain outdoor burning during specified \nseasons. The current-approved SIP only permits outdoor burning of woody \nyard trimmings in the City of Lowell for approximately four months out \nof the year--from March 1 through May 31 and from October 1 through \nOctober 31. Under the revised section 47-015, outdoor burning of woody \nyard trimmings is allowed on approved burn days from October 1 through \nJune 15. The net effect of this change is to allow this type of burning \nin Lowell on approved burn days that occur between November 1 to \nFebruary 28 and June 1 to June 15.\n    LRAPA provided an analysis of particulate matter monitoring data to \nshow that the revision to title 47 allowing burning in November, \nDecember, January, and February and extending the burn season from May \n31 to June 15 will result in negligible increases in particulate matter \nand is highly unlikely to affect compliance with the PM<INF>10</INF> or \nPM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. LRAPA provided this analysis to demonstrate \nthat the increase in outdoor burning does not interfere with the 24-\nhour and annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards and the 24-hour \nPM<INF>10</INF> standard, the types of emissions predominately found in \noutdoor burning of woody yard trimmings.\n    First, LRAPA estimated impacts from the change to overall emissions \nwithin the area. For this analysis, LRAPA used 2020 as an emissions \ninventory base year, during which PM<INF>2.5</INF> emissions totaled \n129,197.64 tons if wildfire impacts are included, or 13,012.90 tons if \nemission from wildfire smoke are excluded. Emissions from all \nresidential\n\n[[Page 22053]]\n\noutdoor burning in Lane County totaled 90.06 tons of PM<INF>2.5</INF> \nin 2020, accounting for 0.07% of total PM<INF>2.5</INF> emissions, or \n0.69% of non-wildfire emissions. Given that these emissions comprise a \nvery small fraction of total emissions in 2020, if emissions from \nresidential outdoor burning were to double as a result of the proposed \nSIP revision--an assumption we view as conservative--these emissions \nwould still comprise a small fraction of overall emissions in the area.\n    LRAPA also noted in its analysis that the proposed revision only \napplies to the City of Lowell, which has a population that comprises \n0.91% of the total for Lane County. Because the revision would only \nactually increase the number of available burn days for a small subset \nof Lane County's population, we believe the actual impacts to overall \nPM<INF>2.5</INF> emissions would likely be significantly smaller than \nthe quantities estimated in the preceding paragraphs.\n    With respect to PM<INF>10</INF>, LRAPA provided an analysis of \npotential impacts to the NAAQS design value between October and March \n(when burning would coincide with wood stove use) that indicates that \nPM<INF>10</INF> levels over the past 10 years are consistently less \nthan a third of the 150 [mu]g/m\\3\\ PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS. Based on our \nreview of the submission, we conclude that it is highly unlikely that \nthe expected emissions growth from expanding the residential outdoor \nburn season in Lowell could jeopardize compliance with the \nPM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS.\n    Similarly, the PM<INF>2.5</INF> design values measured at the \nregulatory monitoring sites near Lowell, in Cottage Grove, Eugene, and \nOakridge, all were well below the annual and daily standards with \nwildfire data removed.\\1\\ To further assess PM<INF>2.5</INF> levels in \nLowell, LRAPA reviewed non-regulatory PM<INF>2.5</INF> sensor data in \nthe area.\\2\\ LRAPA estimated the annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> design value \nfrom a sensor in Lowell over the past 5 years to be a third of the \ncurrent annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS of 9 [mu]g/m\\3\\ or less and the \nestimated 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> design value to be less than a third \nof the daily PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS of 35 [mu]g/m\\3\\ with data \ninfluenced by wildfire events removed.\\3\\ Additionally, LRAPA included \nan emissions estimate of the potential increase in burn days and found \nthat a conservative doubling of emissions would increase the design \nvalue by only 1.4 percent.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ We note that the wildfire influenced data in LRAPA's \ndemonstration are not eligible for exclusion under the EPA's \nExceptional Events Rule because they do not meet the rule \nrequirements for regulatory significance at this time (See 40 CFR \n50.14(a)). However, to demonstrate the impact of expanding the \noutdoor burning season in Lowell on the area's PM<INF>2.5</INF> \nattainment status, LRAPA excluded the wildfire impacted data from \nthe analysis. The Exceptional Events Rule is available at <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/air-quality-analysis/federal-register-notice-final-revisions-exceptional-events-rule\">https://www.epa.gov/air-quality-analysis/federal-register-notice-final-revisions-exceptional-events-rule</a>.\n    \\2\\ Air sensors are devices that measure air pollution that are \nlower in cost, portable and generally easier to operate than \nregulatory-grade monitors (for more information, see <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/air-sensor-toolbox\">https://www.epa.gov/air-sensor-toolbox</a>). Sensors are helpful to better \nunderstand air quality conditions, but there is more uncertainty \nassociated with sensor measurements because they are not subject to \nthe same quality standards, checks, and assurance as regulatory \nmonitors.\n    \\3\\ On February 7, 2024, the EPA revised the primary \nPM<INF>2.5</INF> annual standard by lowering the level from 12 \n[mu]g/m\\3\\ to 9 [mu]g/m\\3\\. Information regarding the annual and \ndaily PM<INF>2.5</INF> annual standard can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/06/2024-02637/reconsideration-of-the-national-ambient-air-quality-standards-for-particulate-matter\">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/06/2024-02637/reconsideration-of-the-national-ambient-air-quality-standards-for-particulate-matter</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Finally, we note that LRAPA sections 47-015 and 47-020 remain in \nthe approved SIP and place further limits on outdoor burning. \nSpecifically, residential outdoor burning is allowed only on approved \nburning days with the start and end times for burning set as part of \nthe daily burning advisory issued by LRAPA. LRAPA's daily burning \nadvisory and curtailment program \\4\\ restricts outdoor burning when \nunfavorable air quality conditions are forecast, such as high \nPM<INF>2.5</INF> concentrations or stagnant meteorological conditions. \nWhen a curtailment is in place, all outdoor burning is prohibited, \nincluding pile burning of woody yard trimmings. In addition, \nresidential outdoor burning is only allowed after obtaining a permit \nissued by LRAPA pursuant to the SIP-approved permit process (47-020). \nThe rules require LRAPA to review permit applications to ensure all \nreasonable alternatives to burning have been explored and no \npracticable alternative method for disposal of the material exists; and \nto determine that the proposed burning will not cause or contribute to \nsignificant degradation of air quality.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ Section 47-015(1)(c) states: ``No person may cause, or allow \nto be initiated or maintained, any outdoor burning which is \nprohibited by the burning advisory issued by LRAPA.'' Section 47-\n015(2)(a) states: ``Residential outdoor burning is allowed only on \napproved burning days with a valid fire permit (if required by fire \ndistrict). The start and end times for burning vary and are set as \npart of the daily burning advisory issued by LRAPA.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Based on our independent review of LRAPA's analysis and for the \nreasons discussed above, we propose to find that the revisions to 47-\n015 Residential Outdoor Burning Requirements will not interfere with \nattainment of the NAAQS or other applicable requirements of the Clean \nAir Act.\n\nRules Not Appropriate for SIP Approval\n\n    Title 47 contains several provisions that are not appropriate for \nSIP approval, including but not limited to rules related to nuisance \nand fire safety. The EPA's authority to approve SIPs extends to \nprovisions related to attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS and \ncarrying out other specific requirements of section 110 of the CAA.\n    In this action, the EPA is not approving into the SIP the following \nprovisions of title 47 because they are inappropriate for SIP approval: \nLRAPA sections 47-010--definition of ``nuisance'', 47-015(1)(d), 47-\n015(1)(h), 47-020(3), 47-020(9)(i), and 47-020(10).\n\nIII. Proposed Action\n\n    We propose to approve into the Oregon SIP the submitted revisions \nto the LRAPA title 47 outdoor burning rule, sections 001, 005, 010 \n(except the definition of ``nuisance''), 015 (except (1)(d) and \n(1)(h)), and 020 (except (3), (9)(i), and (10)). These rules are State \neffective May 24, 2024, and submitted to the EPA by ODEQ in \ncoordination with LRAPA on July 1, 2024. LRAPA revised title 47 to \nremove the prohibition on outdoor burning from November through \nFebruary and June 1 through June 15 and allow outdoor burning of woody \nyard trimmings in the City of Lowell from October 1 through June 15. \nBased on the demonstration provided by ODEQ and LRAPA, we propose to \nfind that the revision will not interfere with attainment of the NAAQS \nor other applicable requirement of the Clean Air Act.\n\nIV. Incorporation by Reference\n\n    In this document, we are proposing to include in a final rule, \nregulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance \nwith requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, The EPA is proposing to incorporate by \nreference the provisions described in section II of this document. The \nEPA has made, and will continue to make, these documents generally \navailable through <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a> and at the EPA Region 10 \nOffice (please contact the person identified in the FOR FURTHER \nINFORMATION CONTACT section of this preamble for more information).\n\nV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\n\n    Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a \nSIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Clean Air Act \nand applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). \nThus, in reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state \nchoices,\n\n[[Page 22054]]\n\nprovided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, \nthis action merely approves State law as meeting Federal requirements \nand does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by \nState law. For that reason, this action:\n    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review \nby the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 \nFR 51735, October 4, 1993);\n    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, \nFebruary 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under \nExecutive Order 12866;\n    <bullet> Does not impose an information collection burden under the \nprovisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);\n    <bullet> Is certified as not having a significant economic impact \non a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);\n    <bullet> Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or \nuniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);\n    <bullet> Does not have federalism implications as specified in \nExecutive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);\n    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, \nApril 23, 1997) because it approves a state program;\n    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to \nExecutive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and\n    <bullet> Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the \nNational Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 \nnote) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent \nwith the Clean Air Act.\n    In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian \nreservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian Tribe \nhas demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of \nIndian country, the rule does not have tribal implications and will not \nimpose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal \nlaw as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, \n2000).\n\nList of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52\n\n    Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, \nIncorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations, Lead, Nitrogen \ndioxide, Ozone, Particulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements, Sulfur oxides, Volatile organic compounds.\n\n    Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.\n\n    Dated: May 16, 2025.\nEmma Pokon,\nRegional Administrator, Region 10.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09324 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6560-50-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Comments \nare requested regarding: whether the collection of information is \nnecessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, \nincluding whether the information will have practical utility; the \naccuracy of the agency's estimate of burden including the validity of \nthe methodology and assumptions used; ways to enhance the quality, \nutility and clarity of the information to be collected; and ways to \nminimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are \nto respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, \nelectronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or \nother forms of information technology.\n    Comments regarding this information collection received by June 23, \n2025 will be considered. Written comments and recommendations for the \nproposed information collection should be submitted within 30 days of \nthe publication of this notice on the following website \n<a href=\"http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain\">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>. Find this particular information \ncollection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day Review--Open for \nPublic Comments'' or by using the search function.\n    An agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information \nunless the collection of information displays a currently valid OMB \ncontrol number and the agency informs potential persons who are to \nrespond to the collection of information that such persons are not \nrequired to respond to the collection of information unless it displays \na currently valid OMB control number.\n\nRural Business-Cooperative Service\n\n    Title: Rural Development Co-operative Agreements.\n    OMB Control Number: 0570-0074.\n    Summary of Collection: Pursuant to the Federal Agricultural \nImprovement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-127), the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture (USDA) received authorization from Congress under 7 U.S.C. \n2204b(b)(4) to enter into cooperative agreements for the purpose of \nimproving the coordination and effectiveness of programs that benefit \nrural areas. This authority is referred to as the Rural Development \nCooperative Agreement (RDCA) program. There are three agencies within \nUSDA that administer programs that specifically target rural areas: the \nRural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), the Rural Housing Service \n(RHS), and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS).\n    Each year, USDA receives proposals from the public that are not in \nresponse to a specific program announcement. These proposals are called \nunsolicited proposals. If a proposal is related to one or more programs \nadministered by RD, it will be routed for review and possible \nconsideration for a cooperative agreement using the RDCA authority. If \nthe proposal is unique or innovative, then an agency has authority to \nenter into a cooperative agreement without competition (see 2 CFR \n415.1(d)(6)).\n    USDA may, alternatively, issue an invitation to submit applications \nfor a cooperative agreement using the RDCA authority. These proposals \nare called solicited proposals. Solicited proposals would typically be \nannounced via a Federal Register Notice. An example of a solicited \nproposal is an initiative covered under this collection package called \nthe Rural Placemaking Innovation Challenge (RPIC). RPIC is a technical \nassistance and planning process rural community leaders use to create \nplaces where people want to live, work and play. This initiative \nprovides planning support and technical assistance to foster \nplacemaking activities in rural communities. Funds will help enhance \ncapacity for broadband access; preserve cultural and historic \nstructures; and support the development of transportation, housing, and \nrecreational spaces. RPIC is awarded through a competitive solicitation \nprocedure--and proposals are evaluated using a Scoring Process. The \nscoring criterion is targeted to applications that support communities \nthat would address (1) Distressed Areas as defined by the Economic \nInnovation Group Distressed Communities Index (DCI) proposal and (2) \nBroadband Infrastructure Planning.\n    Need and Use of the Information: The Agency provides forms and/or \nguidelines to assist in collection and submission of the information \nrequired. In some cases, use of Agency forms is optional and the \napplicant may submit the information required on other forms. The \nAgency will utilize standard and existing Rural Development forms to \nthe greatest extent possible to continue to meet the needs of the \nprogram. The forms or related items completed by the applicant are \nsubmitted to and evaluated by the Agency. Failure to collect proper \ninformation from applicants could result in improper determinations of \nservicing assistance, hinder the government's recovery of such loans as \nwell as encumber customer service.\n    Description of Respondents: Individuals or Households.\n    Number of Respondents: 64.\n    Frequency of Responses: Recordkeeping; Reporting: Annually.\n    Total Burden Hours: 1,056.\n\nLevi S.

The primary objective of the National Agricultural \nStatistics Service (NASS) is to provide data users with timely and \nreliable agricultural production and economic statistics, as well as \nenvironmental and specialty agricultural related statistics. To \naccomplish this objective, NASS relies on the use of diverse surveys \nthat show changes within the farming industry over time.\n    The primary functions of the National Agricultural Statistics \nServices' (NASS) are to prepare and issue State and national estimates \nof crop and livestock production, disposition, and prices and to \ncollect information on related environmental and economic factors. The \nField Crops Production Program consists of probability field crops \nsurveys and supplemental panel surveys. NASS will use surveys to \ncollect information through a combination of the internet, mail, \ntelephone, and personnel interviews. The general authority for these \ndata collection activities is granted under 7 U.S.C. 2204.\n    The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is requesting a \nsubstantive change to the Field Crops Production information collection \nrequest (OMB No. 0535-0002) to reinstate the Small Grains County \nEstimates Survey beginning with the 2025 production year to be \nconducted in summer-fall 2025. The questionnaire will remain unchanged. \nThe changes in this request increases burden hours.\n    Need and Use of the Information: NASS collects information on field \ncrops to monitor agricultural developments across the country that may \nimpact on the nation's food supply. The Secretary of Agriculture uses \nestimates of crop production to administer farm program legislation and \nimport and export programs. Collecting this information less frequently \nwould eliminate the data needed to keep the Department abreast of \nchanges at the State and national level.\n    Description of Respondents: Farms; Business or other for-profits.\n    Number of Respondents: 426,675.\n    Frequency of Responses: Reporting: Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, \nAnnually.\n    Total Burden Hours: 139,806.\n\nNational Agricultural Statistics Service\n\n    Title: Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) Survey.\n    OMB Control Number: 0535-0245.\n    Summary of Collection: General authority for these data collection \nactivities is granted under 7 U.S.C. 2204 which specifies that ``The \nSecretary of Agriculture shall procure and preserve all information \nconcerning agriculture which he can obtain . . . by the collection of \nstatistics . . .''. The primary objective of the National Agricultural \nStatistics Service (NASS) is to provide data users with timely and \nreliable agricultural production and economic statistics, as well as \nenvironmental and specialty agricultural related statistics. To \naccomplish this objective, NASS relies on the use of diverse surveys \nthat show changes within the farming industry over time.\n    The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is requesting a \nsubstantive change to the National Resources Inventory Conservation \nEffects Assessment Project (NRI CEAP) survey. NASS requests to use the \nseven minimum category version of the race/ethnicity question \n(including examples) as contained in the Office of Management and \nBudget's Statistical Policy Directive 15. Using the minimum categories \nwith examples would allow NASS to keep the questionnaire at 44 pages \nand reduce burden to the public compared to using the standard race/\nethnicity question version. Disclosure and data quality concerns would \nprevent most summarized data from the standard race/ethnicity version \nfrom publication.\n    Need and Use of the Information: The survey will utilize personal \ninterviews to administer a questionnaire that is designed to obtain \nfrom farm operators field-specific data associated with selected \nNational Resources Inventory sub-sample units in the contiguous 48 \nStates. Data collected in this survey will be used in conjunction with \npreviously collected data on soils, climate, and cropping history to \nmodel impacts of conservation practices on the larger environment. USDA \nneeds updated scientifically credible data on residue and tillage \nmanagement, nutrient management, and conservation practices in order to \nquantify and assess current impacts of farming practices and to \ndocument changes.\n    Description of Respondents: Farms and Ranches.\n    Number of Respondents: 20,000.\n    Frequency of Responses: Reporting: Annually.\n    Total Burden Hours: 17,173.\n\nLevi S.

For a full description of the scope of the \nOrder, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum.\n\nVietnam-Wide Entity\n\n    Under Commerce's policy regarding the conditional review of the \nVietnam-wide entity,\\7\\ the Vietnam-wide entity will not be under \nreview unless a party specifically requests, or Commerce self-\ninitiates, a review of the entity. Because no party requested a review \nof the Vietnam-wide entity in this review, the entity is not under \nreview, and the entity's rate (i.e., 16.25) is not subject to \nchange.\\8\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See Antidumping Proceedings: Announcement of Change in \nDepartment Practice for Respondent Selection in Antidumping Duty \nProceedings and Conditional Review of the Nonmarket Economy Entity \nin NME Antidumping Duty Proceedings, 78 FR 65963 (November 4, 2013).\n    \\8\\ See Order.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    With the exception of Sonha SSP and Vinlong, Commerce considers all \nother companies for which a review was requested and initiated but did \nnot demonstrate separate rate eligibility to be part of the Vietnam-\nwide entity.\\9\\ Therefore, for these final results, we continue to \nconsider Mejonson Industrial Vietnam Co., Ltd., to be part of the \nVietnam-wide entity because it did not file a separate rate application \nor certification.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ See Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \nAdministrative Reviews, 88 FR 62322 (September 11, 2023).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnalysis of Comments Received\n\n    All issues raised in an interested party's case brief are addressed \nin the Issues and Decision Memorandum. A list of these issues is \nattached as an appendix to this notice. The Issues and Decision \nMemorandum is a public document and is on file electronically via \nEnforcement and Compliance's Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \nCentralized Electronic Service System (ACCESS).

Thus, the weighted-average dumping \nmargin for the Vietnam-wide entity (i.e., 16.25 percent) \\13\\ is not \nsubject to change as a result of this review.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See Antidumping Proceedings: Announcement of Change in \nDepartment Practice for Respondent Selection in Antidumping Duty \nProceedings and Conditional Review of the Nonmarket Economy Entity \nin NME Antidumping Duty Proceedings, 78 FR 65963, 65969-70 (November \n4, 2013).\n    \\13\\ See Order.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Results of Review\n\n    We determine that the following weighted-average dumping margin \nexists for the period July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Weighted-average\n                      Exporter                          dumping margin\n                                                           (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSonha SSP Vietnam Sole Member Company Limited/Sonha               144.59\n International Corporation \\14\\.....................\nVinlong Stainless Steel (Vietnam) Co., Ltd..........              144.59\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclosure\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ We are treating these companies as a single entity for \npurposes of this review. For a complete discussion, see Memorandum, \n``Affiliation and Collapsing of Sonha International and Sonha SSP \nVietnam Sole Member Company Limited,'' dated August 6, 2024.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    We intend to disclose the calculations performed for these final \nresults of review to interested parties within five days of the date of \npublication of this notice in the Federal Register, in accordance with \n19 CFR 351.224(b).\n\nAssessment Rates\n\n    Pursuant to section 751(a)(2)(A) of the Act, and 19 CFR \n351.212(b)(1), Commerce has determined, and U.S. Customs and Border \nProtections (CBP) shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate \nentries of subject merchandise in accordance with the final results of \nthis review. Commerce intends to issue assessment instructions to CBP \nno earlier than 35 days after the date of publication of the final \nresults of this review in the Federal Register. If a timely summons is \nfiled at the U.S. Court of International Trade, the assessment \ninstructions will direct CBP not to liquidate relevant entries until \nthe time for parties to file a request for a statutory injunction has \nexpired (i.e., within 90 days of publication).\n    For Sonha SSP which has a final weighted-average dumping margin \nthat is not zero or de minimis (i.e., less than 0.5 percent), we \ncalculated importer-specific ad valorem duty assessment rates based on \nthe ratio of the total amount of dumping calculated for each importer's \nexamined sales and the total entered value of the sales, in accordance \nwith 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1). Where the respondent did not report entered \nvalue, we will calculate importer-specific per-unit duty assessment \nrates based on the ratio of the total amount of antidumping duties \ncalculated for the examined sales to the total quantity of those sales. \nWhere an importer-specific assessment rate is de minimis (i.e., less \nthan 0.5 percent), the entries by that importer will be liquidated \nwithout regard to antidumping duties.\n    Pursuant to Commerce's practice, we will instruct CBP to liquidate \nentries from Vinlong at 144.59 percent.\n    Pursuant to a refinement in our non-market economy practice, for \nsales that were not reported in the U.S. sales data submitted by Sonha \nSSP or Vinlong, we will instruct CBP to liquidate entries associated \nwith those sales at the rate for the Vietnam-wide entity. For entries \nof subject merchandise during the POR produced by Sonha SSP or Vinlong \nfor which it did not know its merchandise was destined for the United \nStates, we intend to instruct CBP to liquidate such entries at the \nVietnam-wide rate if there is no rate for the intermediate company or \ncompanies involved in the transaction.\n\nCash Deposit Requirements\n\n    The following deposit requirements will be effective upon \npublication of the final results of this administrative review for all \nshipments of the subject merchandise from Vietnam entered, or withdrawn \nfrom warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as \nprovided by section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act: (1) for Sonha SSP and \nVinlong Stainless the cash deposit rate will be the margin listed \nabove; (2) for previously investigated or reviewed Vietnamese and non-\nVietnamese exporters not listed above that have separate rates, the \ncash deposit rate will continue to be the exporter-specific rate \npublished for the most recently completed segment of this proceeding in \nwhich they were reviewed; (3) for all Vietnamese exporters of subject \nmerchandise that have not been found to be entitled to a separate rate, \nthe cash deposit rate will be equal to the weighted-average dumping \nmargin for the Vietnam-wide entity (i.e., 16.25 percent); \\15\\ and (4) \nfor all non-Vietnamese exporters of subject merchandise which have not \nreceived their own separate rate, the cash deposit rate will be the \nrate applicable to the Vietnamese exporter(s) that supplied that non-\nVietnamese exporter. These cash deposit requirements, when imposed, \nshall remain in effect until further notice.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See Order.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotification to Importers\n\n    This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their \nresponsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate \nregarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation \nof the relevant entries during the POR. Failure to comply with this \nrequirement could result in Commerce's presumption that reimbursement \nof antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double \nantidumping duties.\n\nAdministrative Protective Order\n\n    This notice also serves as a final reminder to parties subject to \nan administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility \nconcerning the return or destruction of proprietary\n\n[[Page 22062]]\n\ninformation disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR \n351.305(a)(3). Timely written notification of the return or destruction \nof APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby \nrequested. Failure to comply with the regulations and terms of an APO \nis a violation subject to sanction.\n\nNotification to Interested Parties\n\n    Commerce is issuing and publishing the final results of this review \nin accordance with sections 751(a)(1) and 777(i)(1) of the Act, and 19 \nCFR 351.221(b)(5).\n\n    Dated: May 12, 2025.\nChristopher Abbott,\nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Policy and Negotiations, performing the \nnon-exclusive functions and duties of the Assistant Secretary for \nEnforcement and Compliance.\n\nAppendix\n\nList of Topics Discussed in the Issues and Decision Memorandum\n\nI.

Purpose\n\n    Under the PRA, (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) Federal agencies must obtain \napproval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each \ncollection of information they conduct or sponsor. ``Collection of \ninformation'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and \nincludes Agency requests or requirements that members of the public \nsubmit reports, keep records, or\n\n[[Page 22064]]\n\nprovide information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA \nrequires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day notice in the Federal \nRegister concerning each proposed collection of information, including \neach proposed extension of an existing collection of information, \nbefore submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with \nthis requirement, USPTO is publishing notice of the proposed collection \nof information set forth in this document.\n    Under the Government Service Delivery Improvement Act \\1\\ and the \n21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act,\\2\\ along with OMB \nguidance, agencies are obligated to continually improve the services \nthey provide the public and to collect qualitative and quantitative \ndata from the public to do so.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 5 U.S.C. 321-24.\n    \\2\\ 44 U.S.C. 3501 note.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The purpose of this request is to facilitate USPTO's ability to \ncollect feedback from the public to continue to improve its services, \nthereby facilitating its compliance with statutory requirements and \ngeneral principles of good governance.\n    USPTO will only submit collections if they meet the following \ncriteria.\n    <bullet> The collections are voluntary;\n    <bullet> The collections are low-burden for respondents (based on \nconsiderations of total burden hours or burden-hours per respondent) \nand are low-cost for both the respondents and the Federal Government;\n    <bullet> The collections are non-controversial;\n    <bullet> Any collection is targeted to the solicitation of opinions \nfrom respondents who have experience with the program or may have \nexperience with the program in the near future;\n    <bullet> Personally identifiable information (PII) is collected \nonly to the extent necessary and is not retained;\n    <bullet> Information gathered is intended to be used for general \nservice improvement and program management purposes\n    <bullet> The agency will follow the procedures specified in any \nrelevant OMB guidance for the required reporting to OMB of data from \nsurveys.\n    <bullet> Outside of the reporting mentioned in the bullet \nimmediately above, if the Agency intends to release journey maps, user \npersonas, reports, or other data-related summaries stemming from this \ncollection, the Agency must include appropriate caveats around those \nsummaries, noting that conclusions should not be generalized beyond the \nsample, considering the sample size and response rates. The Agency must \nsubmit the data summary itself (e.g., the report) and the caveat \nlanguage mentioned above to OMB before it releases them outside the \nAgency. OMB will engage in a passback process with the agency.\n\nMethod of Collection\n\n    The USPTO will collect this information by electronic means when \npossible, as well as by mail, fax, telephone, technical discussions, \nand in-person interviews. USPTO may also utilize observational \ntechniques to collect this information.\n\nData\n\n    Form Number(s): OMB Control No. 0651-0088.\n    Type of Review: Renewal of an existing collection.\n\nB. Annual Reporting Burden\n\n    Affected Public: Collections will be targeted to the solicitation \nof opinions from respondents who have experience with the program or \nmay have experience with the program in the near future. Respondents \nmay include individuals, businesses, and organizations that interact \nwith a Federal Government agency or program, either directly or via a \nFederal contractor.\n    Estimated Number of Respondents: 1,101,500.\n    Estimated Time per Response: Varied, dependent upon the data \ncollection method used. The possible response time to complete a \nquestionnaire or survey may be 3 minutes or up to 1.5 hours to \nparticipate in an interview.\n    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 100,800.\n\nC. Public Comments\n\n    The USPTO invites comments on: (a) Whether the proposed collection \nof information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions \nof the Agency, including whether the information will have practical \nutility; (b) the accuracy of the Agency's estimate of the burden of the \nproposed collection of information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, \nutility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways \nto minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, \nincluding through the use of automated collection techniques or other \nforms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this \nnotice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB \napproval of this information collection; they also will become a matter \nof public record.\n\nJustin Isaac,\nInformation Collections Officer, Office of the Chief Administrative \nOfficer, United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09357 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 3510-16-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Louisiana LNG states that, earlier this year, Woodside entered \ninto a binding agreement with Stonepeak Wallaby I Acquiror LP \n(Stonepeak), a Delaware limited partnership, under which Stonepeak will \nacquire a 40 percent equity interest in Louisiana LNG (Proposed \nTransaction). Specifically, Stonepeak will contribute approximately \n$5.7 billion in equity toward the expected capital expenditure for the \ndevelopment of the first three liquefaction plants (and associated \ncommon facilities) of the Woodside Louisiana LNG Project, the proposed \nfacility--currently under construction--from which Louisiana LNG holds \nauthorization to export liquefied natural gas (LNG).\n    Louisiana LNG states that the Proposed Transaction is anticipated \nto close in the second quarter of 2025. Louisiana LNG further states \nthat, after the Proposed Transaction is consummated, it will continue \nto be the sole holder of the export authorizations at issue.\n    The Statement includes a chart illustrating the ownership structure \nof Louisiana LNG following the closing of the Proposed Transaction. \nAdditional details can be found in the Statement, posted on the DOE \nwebsite at: <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/LALNG%20CIC%20%28Stonepeak%29.pdf\">https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/LALNG%20CIC%20%28Stonepeak%29.pdf</a>.\n\nDOE Evaluation\n\n    DOE will review the Statement in accordance with its CIC \nProcedures.\\1\\ Consistent with the CIC Procedures, this notice \naddresses Louisiana LNG's existing authorization to export LNG to \ncountries with which the United States has not entered into a free \ntrade agreement (FTA) requiring national treatment for trade in natural \ngas and\n\n[[Page 22083]]\n\nwith which trade is not prohibited by United States law or policy (non-\nFTA countries), granted in DOE/FE Order No. 4373,\\2\\ as amended.\\3\\ If \nno interested person protests the change in control and DOE takes no \naction on its own motion, the proposed change in control will be deemed \ngranted 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. If one or \nmore protests are submitted, DOE will review any motions to intervene, \nprotests, and answers, and will issue a determination as to whether the \nproposed change in control has been demonstrated to render the \nunderlying authorization inconsistent with the public interest.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 79 FR 65541 (Nov. 5, 2014).\n    \\2\\ FECM, formerly called the Office of Fossil Energy (FE), \nchanged its name on July 4, 2021.\n    \\3\\ Louisiana LNG's Statement also applies to the company's \nexisting authorization to export LNG to FTA countries in the same \ndocket. DOE will respond to that portion of the filing separately \npursuant to the CIC Procedures, 79 FR at 65542.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublic Comment Procedures\n\n    Interested persons will be provided 15 days from the date of \npublication of this notice in the Federal Register to move to \nintervene, protest, and answer the Statement.\\4\\ Protests, motions to \nintervene, notices of intervention, and written comments are invited in \nresponse to this notice only as to the change in control described in \nthe Statement. All protests, comments, motions to intervene, or notices \nof intervention must meet the requirements specified by DOE's \nregulations in 10 CFR part 590, including the service requirements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ Intervention, if granted, would constitute intervention only \nin the change in control portion of these proceedings, as described \nherein.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Filings may be submitted using one of the following methods:\n    (1) Submitting the filing electronically at <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5b3d3e293c3a281b332a753f343e753c342d\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"89efecfbeee8fac9e1f8a7ede6eca7eee6ff\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>;\n    (2) Mailing the filing to the Office of Regulation, Analysis, and \nEngagement at the address listed in the ADDRESSES section; or\n    (3) Hand delivering the filing to the Office of Regulation, \nAnalysis, and Engagement at the address listed in the ADDRESSES \nsection.\n    For administrative efficiency, DOE prefers filings to be filed \nelectronically.

Under this program, EPA regulates newly \ngenerated hazardous wastes as well as hazardous remediation wastes \n(i.e., hazardous wastes managed during cleanup). Hazardous remediation \nwaste management sites must comply with all parts of 40 CFR part 264 \nexcept subparts B, C, and D. In place of these requirements, they need \nto comply with performance standards based on the general requirement \ngoals in these sections, which are codified at 40 CFR 264.1(j).\n    Under Sec.  264.1(j), owners/operators of remediation waste \nmanagement sites must develop and maintain procedures to prevent \naccidents. These procedures must address proper design, construction, \nmaintenance, and operation of hazardous remediation waste management \nunits at the site. In addition, owners/operators must develop and \nmaintain a contingency and emergency plan to control accidents that \noccur. The plan must explain specifically how to treat, store, and \ndispose of the hazardous remediation waste in question, and must be \nimplemented immediately whenever fire, explosion, or release of \nhazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents that could threaten \nhuman health or the environment. In addition, the Remedial Action Plan \nstreamlines the permitting process for remediation waste management \nsites to allow cleanups to take place more quickly.\n    Form Numbers: None.\n    Respondents/affected entities: Entities potentially affected by \nthis action are the private sector, as well as state, local, or Tribal \ngovernments.\n    Respondent's obligation to respond: Mandatory (RCRA section \n3004(u)).\n    Estimated number of respondents: 178.\n    Frequency of response: One-time.\n    Total estimated burden: 5,114 hours per year.

EPA approved California's initial application for \nprimary enforcement authority (``primacy'') of drinking water systems \non June 9, 1978 (43 FR 25180). Since initial primacy approval, EPA has \napproved various revisions to California's primacy program. For the \nrevision covered by this action, EPA promulgated rules incorporating \nthe PWS Definition as a requirement of primacy at 40 CFR 141.2 on April \n28, 1998 (63 FR 23362) and EPA issued guidance on the PWS definition on \nAugust 5, 1998 (63 FR 41940). EPA has determined that California has \nadopted into state law PWS Definition requirements that are comparable \nto and no less stringent than the Federal requirements. EPA has also \ndetermined that the State's program revision request meets all of the \nregulatory requirements for approval, as set forth in 40 CFR 142.12, \nincluding a side-by-side comparison of the Federal requirements \ndemonstrating the corresponding State authorities, additional materials \nto support special primacy requirements of 40 CFR 142.16, a review of \nthe requirements contained in 40 CFR 142.10 necessary for States to \nattain and retain primary enforcement responsibility, and a statement \nby the California Attorney General certifying that California's laws \nand regulations to carry out the program revision were duly adopted and \nare enforceable. The Attorney General's statement also affirms that \nthere are no environmental audit privilege and immunity laws that would \nimpact California's ability to implement or enforce the California laws \nand regulations pertaining to the program revision. Therefore, EPA \napproves this revision of California's approved State primacy program. \nThe Technical Support Document, which provides EPA's analysis of \nCalifornia's program revision request, is available by submitting a \nrequest to the following email address: <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88dab1ecffa5f8fae7effae9e5c8edf8e9a6efe7fe\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"8edcb7eaf9a3fefce1e9fcefe3ceebfeefa0e9e1f8\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Please \nnote ``Technical Support Document'' in the subject line of the email.\n    Public Process. Any interested person may request a public hearing \non this determination. A request for a public hearing must be received \nor postmarked before June 23, 2025 and addressed to the Regional \nAdministrator of EPA Region 9, via the following email address: <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2d7f14495a005d5f424a5f4c406d485d4c034a425b\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"56046f32217b2624393124373b1633263778313920\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, or by contacting the EPA Region 9 contact person \nlisted above in this notice by telephone if you do not have access to \nemail.

The NO<INF>X</INF> \nSIP Call requires affected states to include certain provisions in \ntheir state implementation plans (SIPs) addressing emissions of \nNO<INF>X</INF> that adversely affect air quality in other states. \nAlthough most large combustion sources affected under the \nNO<INF>X</INF> SIP Callare also subject to monitoring requirements \nunder the Acid Rain Program or the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, this \ninformation collection is being renewed because some industrial sources \nin certain states are still required to monitor and report emissions \ndata to EPA under these rules, so we will account for their burden. All \ndata received by EPA will be treated as public information.

This increase is due to an increased estimation of \nexpected sources reporting under the NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call. In the \nprevious ICR, the EPA anticipated states and sources to exercise a \nnewly implemented option to utilize less burdensome monitoring and \nreporting, but fewer states than expected exercised that option for \nsources within their borders.\n\nCourtney Kerwin,\nDirector, Information Engagement Division.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09299 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6560-50-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

EPA approved Hawaii's initial application for primary \nenforcement authority (``primacy'') of drinking water systems on \nOctober 20, 1977 (42 FR 47244). Since initial primacy approval, EPA has \napproved various revisions to Hawaii's primacy program. For the \nrevision covered by this action, EPA promulgated the GWR at 40 CFR part \n141 subpart S on November 8, 2006 (71 FR 65574). The GWR provides \nprotection against microbial pathogens in public water systems using \nground water sources. EPA has determined that Hawaii has adopted into \nstate law GWR requirements that are comparable to and no less stringent \nthan the Federal requirements. EPA has also determined that the State's \nprogram revision request meets all of the regulatory requirements for \napproval, as set forth in 40 CFR 142.12, including a side-by-side\n\n[[Page 22091]]\n\ncomparison of the Federal requirements demonstrating the corresponding \nState authorities, additional materials to support special primacy \nrequirements of 40 CFR 142.16, a review of the requirements contained \nin 40 CFR 142.10 necessary for States to attain and retain primary \nenforcement responsibility, and a statement by the Hawaii Attorney \nGeneral certifying that Hawaii's laws and regulations to carry out the \nprogram revision were duly adopted and are enforceable. The Attorney \nGeneral's statement also affirms that there are no environmental audit \nprivilege and immunity laws that would impact Hawaii's ability to \nimplement or enforce the Hawaii laws and regulations pertaining to the \nprogram revision. Therefore, EPA approves this revision of Hawaii's \napproved State primacy program. The Technical Support Document, which \nprovides EPA's analysis of Hawaii's program revision request, is \navailable by submitting a request to the following email address: <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c99bf0adbee4b9bba6aebba8a489acb9a8e7aea6bf\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"04563d60732974766b63766569446174652a636b72\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Please note ``Technical Support Document'' in the \nsubject line of the email.\n    Public Process. Any interested person may request a public hearing \non this determination.

The signature of the \nindividual making the request, or, if the request is made on behalf of \nan organization or other entity, the signature of a responsible \nofficial of the organization or other entity.\n    If EPA Region 9 does not receive a timely request for a hearing or \na request for a hearing was denied by the Regional Administrator for \nbeing frivolous or insubstantial, and the Regional Administrator does \nnot elect to hold a hearing on their own motion, EPA's approval shall \nbecome final and effective on June 23, 2025, and no further public \nnotice will be issued.\n    Authority: Section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, \n42 U.S.C. 300g-2 (1996), and 40 CFR part 142 of the National Primary \nDrinking Water Regulations.\n\n    Dated: April 18, 2025.\nJoshua F.

Furthermore, FAR 52.216-7 states that indirect \ncost rates shall be established for each fiscal year at the close of a \ncontractor's fiscal year. EPA Form 1900-10 summarizes this information \nfor the entire contract period and provides a basis for cost review by \ncontracting, finance, and audit personnel. In addition, FAR 4.804-5 \nmandates that the office administering the contract shall ensure that \nthe costs and indirect cost rates are settled.\n    Form Numbers: EPA Form 1900-10.\n    Respondents/affected entities: All contractors who have completed \nan EPA cost-reimbursement type contract.\n    Respondent's obligation to respond: Mandatory (FAR 52.216-7).\n    Estimated number of respondents: 5 (total).\n    Frequency of response: Once, at end of contract.\n    Total estimated burden: 31.5 hours (per year). Burden is defined at \n5 CFR 1320.03(b).\n    Total estimated cost: $7,353.60 (per year), which includes $0 \nannualized capital or operation & maintenance costs.\n    Changes in the Estimates: There is no change in hours in the total \nestimated respondent burden compared with the ICR currently approved by \nOMB.\n\nPamela Legare,\nDirector, Office of Acquisition Solutions.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09275 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6560-50-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Your request, submitted as an electronic ruling request, \nwas forwarded to this office from the National Commodity Specialist \nDivision (``NCSD''). Wai Medical is a party-at-interest within the \nmeaning of 19 CFR 177.22(d)(1) and 177.23(a) and is therefore \nentitled to request this final determination.\n\nFacts\n\n    The merchandise at issue is the Selec-3 IV Product. The Selec-3 \nIV Product is an intravenous set made with components from a variety \nof U.S. and non-U.S. components. The Selec-3 IV Product has a \npatented selectable drop chamber (``SDC'') that offers three drop \nsettings. These settings allow the user to adjust the drip rate for \nthe fluids administered via the Selec-3 IV Product. By allowing the \nuser to quickly and easily change the drip rate, the Selec-3 IV \nProduct saves time, reduces inventory costs, and minimizes the risk \nof contamination of fluids administered to patients.\n    The Selec-3 IV Product has the following components:\n    <bullet> Check valve and connector: allows opening and closing \nthe polyvinyl chloride (``PVC'') tube for purposes of helping \nregulate flow of the fluid and allows control of fluid from either \nthe Drop Chamber or one of the Y-sites.\n    <bullet> Dust cap: placed on the end of the Selec-3 IV Product \nto ensure the end remains uncontaminated prior to use.\n    <bullet> Pinch Clamp (x2): The pinch clamps can be used to stop \nand start the flow of liquid through the tubing and to the patient.\n    <bullet> PVC Tube (73 Inches): The PVC tube allows the fluid to \nflow from the bag containing the fluid, through the SDC, and \nultimately to the patient.\n    <bullet> Roller Clamp: The clamp is a binary control allowing or \ndisallowing flow of fluid into the SDC, and thus to the patient.\n    <bullet> SDC: The SDC is a clear plastic tube with a mechanism \nallowing the user to select one of three drop rates. The SDC is \npatented and allows unwanted gas to bubble out of the fluid, \nallowing medical staff to see that fluid is flowing through the IV, \nand allowing regulation of the flow rate through the patented \nadjustable SDC.\n    <bullet> Spike and Cap: The spike is used to connect the Selec-3 \nIV Product to the fluid being administered to the patient. The spike \nis inserted into the bag holding the fluid. The cap is used to \nensure the spike is not contaminated prior to use.\n    <bullet> Spin Lock: The spin lock allows connection between a \ndevice allowing the direct infusion of the fluids into the patient \nto the Selec-3 IV Product.\n    <bullet> Y-Sites (x3): The Y-sites allow the injection of \nadditional treatments or medicines to be administered to the \npatient, in addition to the fluid connected to the Selec-3 IV \nProduct that runs through the SDC and tubing to the patient.\n    Assembly of the Selec-3 IV Product involves three steps: (1) \nassembly of the SDC subassembly with the roller clamp and spike, (2) \nthe assembly of the other tubing sub-assemblies, and (3) the final \nassembly.\n\n(1) Assembly of the SDC\n\n    Assembly of the SDC involves connecting, gluing, and sealing the \nparts of the SDC,\n    including the tubing and the roller clamp and spike. The plastic \ntubing is inspected and the tube to the drip-rate selector is \naligned and glued. Then, the drop chamber is inspected and cured \nwith ultraviolet light to bind them together. The assembler must \napply silicone to the selector, sealing the selector, and adding the \nselector top. Lastly, the chamber is connected to a short piece of \ntubing that ends with a roller clamp and spike. The total cost of \nthe SDC sub-assembly components is roughly less than half of the \ntotal cost of the Selec-3 IV Product.\n\n(2) Assembly of the Other Tubing Sub-Assemblies\n\n    The premanufactured parts are inspected for defects. Assembly \ncontinues with three sections of tubing, i.e., the primary tubing, \nthe patient side assembly (top half), and the extension set (bottom \nhalf). To assemble each of those three sections, tubing is connected \nto luers and Y-sites.\n\n(3) Final Assembly\n\n    During the final assembly process, the primary tubing, the \npatient side assembly, and the extension set are put together with \nthe SDC sub-assembly, and the Selec-3 IV Product is complete. \nAdhesives are added to ensure lasting connection between certain \nparts.\n    Set forth below are several sourcing scenarios for components \nthat Wai Medical is contemplating. Wai Medical requests that CBP \nissue a determination covering all five scenarios below.\n    Scenario 1: All of the Selec-3 IV Product components originate \nfrom the United States, are sterilized in the United States, and \nthen are assembled in India prior to being re-imported, and fully \nassembled in the United States.\n    Scenario 2: The SDC originates from the United States and is \nassembled into the SDC sub-assembly (including the roller clamp and \nspike) in the United States. The remaining components originate, are \nsterilized, and assembled in India. The final assembly takes place \nin India.\n    Scenario 3: The SDC originates from the United States. The SDC \nsub-assembly takes place in India. Additionally, remaining \ncomponents originate, are sterilized, and assembled in India. The \nfinal assembly takes place in India.\n    Scenario 4: The SDC originates from Mexico and all components \n(including SDC) are sterilized and assembled in India. All of the \nSelec-3 IV Product components, except the SDC, originate and are \nsterilized in non-TAA eligible countries. The final assembly takes \nplace in India.\n    Scenario 5: The SDC components originate and are assembled into \nthe SDC sub-assembly in Mexico. All other parts of the Selec-3 IV \nProduct originate from China. Sterilization of the entire product \noccurs in China. The final assembly takes place in India.\n\nIssue\n\n    What is the country of origin of the Biomedix Selec-3 Multiple \nDrop Intravenous Product for purposes of U.S. Government \nprocurement?\n\nLaw & Analysis\n\n    CBP issues country of origin advisory rulings and final \ndeterminations as to whether an article is or would be a product of \na designated country or instrumentality for the purpose of granting \nwaivers of certain ``Buy American'' restrictions in U.S. law or \npractice for products offered for sale to the U.S. Government, \npursuant to subpart B of Part 177, 19 CFR 177.21 et seq., which \nimplements Title III, Trade Agreements Act of 1979, as amended (19 \nU.S.C. 2511-2518).\n    CBP's authority to issue advisory rulings and final \ndeterminations is set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2515(b)(1), which states:\n    For the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary of the \nTreasury shall provide for the prompt issuance of advisory rulings \nand final determinations on whether, under section 2518(4)(B) of \nthis title, an article is or would be a product of a foreign country \nor instrumentality designated pursuant to section 2511(b) of this \ntitle.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n[[Page 22104]]\n\n    The Secretary of the Treasury's authority mentioned above, along \nwith other customs revenue functions, are delegated to the Secretary \nof Homeland Security via Treasury Department Order (TO) 100-20 \n``Delegation of Customs revenue functions to Homeland Security,'' \ndated October 30, 2024, and are subject to further delegations to \nCBP (see also 19 CFR part 177, subpart B).\n    The rule of origin set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2518(4)(B) states:\n    An article is a product of a country or instrumentality only if \n(i) it is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of that country \nor instrumentality, or (ii) in the case of an article which consists \nin whole or in part of materials from another country or \ninstrumentality, it has been substantially transformed into a new \nand different article of commerce with a name, character, or use \ndistinct from that of the article or articles from which it was so \ntransformed.\n\nSee also 19 CFR 177.22(a).\n\n    In rendering advisory rulings and final determinations for \npurposes of U.S. Government procurement, CBP applies the provisions \nof subpart B of Part 177 consistent with the Federal Acquisition \nRegulation (``FAR''). See 19 CFR 177.21. In this regard, CBP \nrecognizes that the FAR restricts the U.S. Government's purchase of \nproducts to U.S.-made or designated country end products for \nacquisitions subject to the TAA. See 48 CFR 25.403(c)(1).\n    The FAR, 48 CFR 25.003, defines ``U.S.-made end product'' as:\n    . . . an article that is mined, produced, or manufactured in the \nUnited States or that is substantially transformed in the United \nStates into a new and different article of commerce with a name, \ncharacter, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from \nwhich it was transformed.\n    Additionally, the FAR, 48 CFR 25.003, defines ``designated \ncountry end product'' as:\n\na WTO GPA [World Trade Organization Government Procurement \nAgreement] country end product, an FTA [Free Trade Agreement] \ncountry end product, a least developed country end product, or a \nCaribbean Basin country end product.\n    Section 25.003 defines ``WTO GPA country end product'' as an \narticle that:\n    (1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a WTO GPA \ncountry; or\n    (2) In the case of an article that consists in whole or in part \nof materials from another country, has been substantially \ntransformed in a WTO GPA country into a new and different article of \ncommerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the \narticle or articles from which it was transformed. The term refers \nto a product offered for purchase under a supply contract, but for \npurposes of calculating the value of the end product includes \nservices (except transportation services) incidental to the article, \nprovided that the value of those incidental services does not exceed \nthat of the article itself.\n    Once again, we note that the Selec-3 IV components are sourced \nfrom both the United States, TAA-designated countries (i.e., \nMexico), as well as non-TAA countries (i.e., China, Vietnam, and \nMalaysia).\n    In order to determine whether a substantial transformation \noccurs when components of various origins are assembled into \ncompleted products, CBP considers the totality of the circumstances \nand makes such determinations on a case-by-case basis. The country \nof origin of the item's components, extent of the processing that \noccurs within a country, and whether such processing renders a \nproduct with a new name, character, and use are primary \nconsiderations in such cases. Additionally, factors such as the \nresources expended on product design and development, the extent and \nnature of post-assembly inspection and testing procedures, and \nworker skill required during the actual manufacturing process will \nbe considered when determining whether a substantial transformation \nhas occurred. No one factor is determinative.\n    Assembly operations that are minimal or simple, as opposed to \ncomplex or meaningful, will generally not result in a substantial \ntransformation. Factors which may be relevant in this evaluation \ninclude the nature of the operation (including the number of \ncomponents assembled), the number of different operations involved, \nand whether a significant period of time, skill, detail, and quality \ncontrol are necessary for the assembly operation. See C.S.D. 80-111, \nC.S.D. 85-25, C.S.D. 89-110, C.S.D. 89-118, C.S.D. 90-51, and C.S.D. \n90-97. If the manufacturing or combining process is a minor one, \nwhich leaves the identity of the article intact, a substantial \ntransformation has not occurred. See Uniroyal, Inc. v. United \nStates, 3 CIT 220, 542 F. Supp. 1026 (1982), aff'd, 702 F.2d 1022 \n(Fed. Cir. 1983) (imported shoe uppers added to an outer sole in the \nUnited States were the ``very essence of the finished shoe'' and the \ncharacter of the product remained unchanged and did not undergo \nsubstantial transformation in the United States).\n    The U.S. Court of International Trade (``CIT'') more recently \ninterpreted the meaning of ``substantial transformation'' in \nEnergizer Battery, Inc. v. United States, 190 F. Supp. 3d 1308 \n(2016). Energizer involved the determination of the country of \norigin of a flashlight, referred to as the Generation II flashlight. \nAll the components of the flashlight were of Chinese origin, except \nfor a white LED and a hydrogen getter. The components were imported \ninto the United States and assembled into the finished Generation II \nflashlight. The Energizer court reviewed the ``name, character and \nuse'' test utilized in determining whether a substantial \ntransformation had occurred and noted, citing Uniroyal, Inc., 3 CIT \nat 226, that when ``the post-importation processing consists of \nassembly, courts have been reluctant to find a change in character, \nparticularly when the imported articles do not undergo a physical \nchange.'' Energizer at 1318. In addition, the court noted that \n``when the end-use was pre-determined at the time of importation, \ncourts have generally not found a change in use.'' Energizer at \n1319.\n    In reaching its decision, the Energizer court expressed the \nquestion as one of whether the imported components retained their \nnames after they were assembled into the finished Generation II \nflashlights. The court found ``[t]he constitutive components of the \nGeneration II flashlight do not lose their individual names as a \nresult [of] the post-importation assembly.'' The court also found \nthat the components had a predetermined end-use as parts and \ncomponents of a Generation II flashlight at the time of importation \nand did not undergo a change in use due to the post-importation \nassembly process. Finally, the court did not find the assembly \nprocess to be sufficiently complex as to constitute a substantial \ntransformation. Thus, the court found that Energizer's imported \ncomponents did not undergo a change in name, character, or use as a \nresult of the post-importation assembly into a finished Generation \nII flashlight. Virtually all of the components of the Generation II \nflashlight, including the most important component, the LED, were of \nChinese origin. Accordingly, the court determined that China was the \ncorrect country of origin of the Generation II flashlights for \npurposes of government procurement.\n    In Headquarters Ruling Letter (``HQ'') 734617, dated August 17, \n1993, CBP considered an IV device for administering fluid and found \nthat the foreign-made tubing assembly with the U.S.-assembled \npatented pump system in California resulted in a substantial \ntransformation and determined the United States to be the country of \norigin. The U.S.-assembled patented pump system performed the \nproduct's most important function, i.e., to regulate and ensure that \nthe proper amount of intravenous medication gets to the patient. \nNotably, more than 75 percent of the value of the finished article \nwas attributable to the U.S. operations.\n    Additionally, in HQ 734006, dated March 25, 1991, CBP held that \nU.S.-origin components of a medical device used to administer liquid \nnutritional preparations are not substantially transformed by \nassembly in Mexico. The value added in Mexico accounted for less \nthan 10 percent of the direct cost of manufacturing the subject \nmerchandise, and it contained no materials of Mexican origin. \nAccordingly, CBP determined there was no change in the name, \ncharacter, or use of the assembled components as this process \nconstituted a simple assembly.\n    In HQ 560613, dated October 28, 1997, CBP held that U.S.-origin \ncomponents were not substantially transformed in Ireland when made \ninto a pregnancy test kit. The test kit was made from the following \nU.S. components: top and bottom housing, paper, antibody, wick, \nlaminate, and nitrocellulose. In addition, a splash guard from \nIreland and rayon from Germany were used. The critical components of \nthe pregnancy test kit were found to be the three U.S.-origin \nantibodies. CBP recognized that the U.S.-origin components imparted \nthe essential character of the pregnancy test kit and that the \nsimple assembly of placing the antibodies onto the rayon membrane, \nand subsequent assembly of the strips into a plastic housing did not \nresult in a substantial transformation. Lastly, in HQ H035441, dated \nSeptember 11, 2008, CBP found that the assembly and sterilization \nprocesses performed in Costa Rica to create the LAP-BAND[supreg] \nSYSTEM AP II were relatively simple and, therefore, the\n\n[[Page 22105]]\n\noperations did not result in a substantial transformation of the \ncomponents. See also HQ 561167, dated December 14, 1998.\n    In the case at hand, the SDC is patent-protected, and we find \nthat it performs the most critical function of the Selec-3 IV \nproduct, i.e., regulating the drip rate of the fluid being \nadministered to the patient. Importantly, the SDC sub-assembly \nconsisting of the SDC plus the roller clamp and the spike represents \nthe single most significant portion of the cost of materials of the \nSelec-3 IV Product. Here, similar to HQ 734617, the SDC imparts the \nessential character of the Selec-3 IV product because it serves the \nproduct's most important function. Additionally, sterilization only \nrepresents a small portion of the total cost of production of the \nsubject merchandise. Consistent with HQ H035441, we find that the \nsterilization process should not result in substantial \ntransformation.\n    Based on the information presented, we find that in Scenarios \nOne, Two, and Three, the last substantial transformation occurs in \nthe United States and therefore, the Selec-3 IV Product is not a \nproduct of a foreign country or instrumentality designated pursuant \nto 2511(b) of this title (i.e., China, Vietnam, and Malaysia). As to \nwhether the Selec-3 IV Product produced in the United States \nqualifies as a ``U.S.-made end product'' under Scenarios One, Two, \nand Three, you may wish to consult with the relevant government \nprocuring agency and review Acetris Health, LLC v. United States, \n949 F.3d 719 (Fed. Cir. 2020). Furthermore, we find that the country \nof origin of the Selec-3 IV Product in Scenarios Four and Five is \nMexico and, therefore is a product of a foreign country or \ninstrumentality designated pursuant to 2511(b) of this title.\n\nHolding\n\n    Based on the information presented, we find that in Scenarios \nOne, Two, and Three, the last substantial transformation of the \nBiomedix Selec-3 Multiple Drop Intravenous Product occurs in the \nUnited States. Furthermore, we find that the country of origin in \nScenarios Four and Five is Mexico.\n    Notice of this final determination will be given in the Federal \nRegister, as required by 19 CFR 177.29. Any party-at-interest other \nthan the party which requested this final determination may request, \npursuant to 19 CFR 177.31, that CBP reexamine the matter anew and \nissue a new final determination. Pursuant to 19 CFR 177.30, any \nparty-at-interest may, within 30 days of publication of the Federal \nRegister Notice referenced above, seek judicial review of this final \ndetermination before the U.S. Court of International Trade.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlice A. Kipel,\nExecutive Director, Regulations & Rulings, Office of Trade.\n\n[FR Doc. 2025-09320 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 9111-14-P\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"

Global Industries, \nInc. (``Global Industries''), the manufacturer of the meeting \ntables, is a party-at-interest within the meaning of 19 CFR \n177.22(d)(1) and Sec.  177.23(a) and is therefore entitled to \nrequest this final determination.\n\nFacts\n\n    The merchandise at issue are the Kadin and Terina models of \nmeeting tables manufactured by Global Industries. Each of these \nmeeting table models is available in different size options, base \nfinishes, and laminate and veneer tabletop finishes.\n\nKadin Table\n\n    The Kadin table consists of a floating top surface, die-cast \naluminum legs and a modular substructure for stability. Surfaces are \noffered in laminate or wood veneer finishes with multiple edge \noptions and in three top shapes--round, square, or rectangular.\n    The Kadin table configurations with laminate table surfaces are \nmanufactured at Global Industries' production facilities in Canada. \nThe sheets used to manufacture the laminate table surfaces are \nsourced from Canada. They are either high-pressure laminate or low-\npressure laminate. For high-pressure laminate sheets, adhesive is \napplied to the back of the sheet, the sheets are pressed onto the \nparticle board substrate, and the adhesive is cured. For both high-\npressure laminate and low-pressure laminate table surfaces, full-\nsize sheets are fed onto a saw that is generated by a computer \nprogram for a precision cut pattern. Inserts are also programmed and \nadded at this stage. The laminate table surfaces are then fed \nthrough an edge bander, which applies a hot melt glue to the edging \nand is pressed onto the edge. The processing of the laminate table\n\n[[Page 22106]]\n\nsurface is completed once the edging is trimmed.\n    The Kadin table configurations with wood veneer table surfaces \nare also manufactured at Global Industries' production facilities in \nCanada. The sheets used to manufacture the wood veneer table \nsurfaces are sourced from Canada. The wood veneer table surfaces are \navailable in a variety of veneer types, including cherry, walnut, \nwhite oak, and maple. Once the veneer type is selected, the veneer \nsheets are pressed onto the particle board substrate, and the \nadhesive is cured. Full-size sheets are fed onto a saw that is \ngenerated by a computer program for a precision cut pattern. Inserts \nare also programmed and added at this stage. The wood veneer table \nsurfaces are then fed through an edge bander, which applies a hot \nmelt glue to the edging and is pressed onto the edge. Next, the \nedging of the wood veneer sheets is trimmed and sanded. The surface \nand edge are then sprayed with a catalyzed lacquer finish and are \ncured. Once this is complete, the wood veneer surface is removed \nfrom the curing area and packaged for shipping.\n    In addition to manufacturing the laminate and wood veneer table \nsurfaces in Canada, the manufacturing process of the Kadin table \nconsists of shipping die-cast aluminum table legs manufactured in \nChina to Canada in a mixture of raw (unpainted) and polished \naluminum (finished). Extruded aluminum connectors and injection-\nmolded plastic components used to assemble the table frames are also \nmanufactured in China and shipped to Canada. The extruded aluminum \npieces, including table beams and screws, are all raw (unpainted). \nInjection-molded plastic components are finished in China. Once \nthese components are shipped in bulk from China to Canada, the beams \nare cut down and pre-drilled to accept screws. The table legs, which \ncan be customized in various finishes, are electrostatically painted \ndepending on the selected finish, along with the matching \nconnectors, die-cast pieces and beams. The painted legs are \nassembled with caps installed on the connectors. Finally, all \nremaining hardware is sorted, assembled and bagged.\n    Once processing of the table surfaces, table legs, and hardware \nis complete, all of the table surface components are boxed in \ncardboard or skidded and strapped, depending on the quantity of \nsurfaces in each package. The table legs and hardware are bagged, \nbubble wrapped and boxed together. Beams longer than 36 inches are \npaper wrapped. All of those components are shipped together from \nCanada to the ultimate customer--in this case, a U.S. government \nagency. Final assembly of all the packaged table components occurs \nin the United States by the ultimate customer, using an installation \nguide provided to the customer by Global Industries.\n\nTerina Table\n\n    The Terina table is a multi-purpose table that allows for quick \nadaptability to various spaces. It includes a flip-top mechanism \ndesigned for one-handed operation, and an angled ``T'' leg design. \nThe flip-mechanism also allows the tables to be stored in an upright \nposition to minimize storage space. Like the Kadin table \nconfiguration, the Terina table surfaces are offered in laminate or \nwood veneer finishes.\n    According to Global Industries, the manufacturing steps for the \nlaminate and wood veneer table surfaces of the Terina configuration \nare identical to those of the Kadin configuration.\n    In addition to manufacturing the laminate and wood veneer Terina \ntable surfaces in Canada, the manufacturing process of the Terina \ntable consists of shipping extruded raw aluminum (unpainted) \nvertical channels from China to Canada. Extruded aluminum connectors \nand injection-molded plastic components used to assemble the table \nframes are also manufactured in China and shipped to Canada. The \nextruded aluminum pieces are all raw (unpainted), whereas the \ninjection-molded plastic components are finished. The ``foot'' of \nthe flip top mechanism, manufactured in China in polished aluminum \n(finished), is shipped to Canada. The Terina configuration includes \ncasters (wheels) that allow the table to be moved in a meeting space \nand are manufactured in China in a grey plastic. The casters are \nshipped in finished form from China to Canada. Once these base \ncomponents are shipped in bundles from China to Canada, the parts \nare unpacked and sorted. The table legs, which can be customized in \nvarious finishes, are electrostatically painted depending on the \nselected finish, along with the matching brackets and beams. The \npainted legs are assembled by installing the foot, brackets, \nhardware, and leveler to the leg pipe. Finally, all remaining \nhardware is sorted, assembled and bagged.\n    Once processing of the table surfaces, table legs, and hardware \nis complete, all of the table surface components are boxed in \ncardboard or skidded and strapped, depending on the quantity of \nsurfaces in each package. The table legs and hardware are bagged, \nbubble wrapped and boxed together. Together, all of those components \nare shipped together from Canada to the ultimate customer--in this \ncase, a U.S. government agency. Final assembly of all the packaged \ntable components occurs in the United States by the ultimate \ncustomer, using an installation guide provided to the customer by \nGlobal Industries.\n\nIssue\n\n    What is the country of origin of the Kadin and Terina meeting \ntables for purposes of U.S. Government procurement?\n\nLaw and Analysis\n\n    CBP issues country of origin advisory rulings and final \ndeterminations as to whether an article is or would be a product of \na designated country or instrumentality for the purpose of granting \nwaivers of certain ``Buy American'' restrictions in U.S. law or \npractice for products offered for sale to the U.S. Government, \npursuant to subpart B of Part 177, 19 CFR 177.21 et seq., which \nimplements Title III, Trade Agreements Act of 1979, as amended (19 \nU.S.C. 2511-2518).\n    CBP's authority to issue advisory rulings and final \ndeterminations stems from 19 U.S.C. 2515(b)(1), which states:\n    For the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary of the \nTreasury shall provide for the prompt issuance of advisory rulings \nand final determinations on whether, under section 2518(4)(B) of \nthis title, an article is or would be a product of a foreign country \nor instrumentality designated pursuant to section 2511(b) of this \ntitle.\n    Emphasis added.\n    The Secretary of the Treasury's authority mentioned above, along \nwith other customs revenue functions, are delegated to the Secretary \nof Homeland Security via Treasury Department Order (TO) 100-20 \n``Delegation of Customs revenue functions to Homeland Security,'' \ndated October 30, 2024, and are subject to further delegations to \nCBP (see also 19 CFR part 177, subpart B).\n    The rule of origin set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2518(4)(B) states:\n    An article is a product of a country or instrumentality only if \n(i) it is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of that country \nor instrumentality, or (ii) in the case of an article which consists \nin whole or in part of materials from another country or \ninstrumentality, it has been substantially transformed into a new \nand different article of commerce with a name, character, or use \ndistinct from that of the article or articles from which it was so \ntransformed.\n    See also 19 CFR 177.22(a).\n    In rendering advisory rulings and final determinations for \npurposes of U.S. Government procurement, CBP applies the provisions \nof subpart B of Part 177 consistent with the Federal Acquisition \nRegulation (``FAR''). See 19 CFR 177.21. In this regard, CBP \nrecognizes that the FAR restricts the U.S. Government's purchase of \nproducts to U.S.-made or designated country end products for \nacquisitions subject to the TAA. See 48 CFR 25.403(c)(1).\n    Section 25.003 defines ``designated country end product'' as:\n\na WTO GPA [World Trade Organization Government Procurement \nAgreement] country end product, an FTA [Free Trade Agreement] \ncountry end product, a least developed country end product, or a \nCaribbean Basin country end product.\n    Section 25.003 defines ``Free Trade Agreement country end \nproduct'' as an article that:\n    (1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a Free \nTrade Agreement (FTA) country; or\n    (2) In the case of an article that consists in whole or in part \nof materials from another country, has been substantially \ntransformed in an FTA country into a new and different article of \ncommerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the \narticle or articles from which it was transformed.\n    ``Free Trade Agreement country'' means Australia, Bahrain, \nCanada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El \nSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Korea (Republic of), Mexico, Morocco, \nNicaragua, Oman, Panama, Peru, or Singapore. See 48 CFR 25.003. \nThus, Canada is an FTA country for purposes of the FAR.\n    In order to determine whether a substantial transformation \noccurs, CBP considers the totality of the circumstances and makes \nsuch determinations on a case-by-case basis. The\n\n[[Page 22107]]\n\ncountry of origin of the item's components, extent of the processing \nthat occurs within a country, and whether such processing renders a \nproduct with a new name, character, and use are primary \nconsiderations in such cases. Additionally, CBP considers factors \nsuch as the resources expended on product design and development, \nthe extent and nature of post-assembly inspection and testing \nprocedures, and worker skill required during the actual \nmanufacturing process when determining whether a substantial \ntransformation has occurred. No one factor is determinative.\n    In Carlson Furniture Indus. v. United States, 65 Cust. Ct. 474, \nCust. Dec. 4126 (1970), which involved wooden chair parts, the court \nheld that the assembly operations after importation were substantial \nin nature and more than a simple assembly of parts. The importer \nassembled, fitted, and glued the wooden parts together, inserted \nsteel pins into the key joints, cut the legs to length and leveled \nthem, and in some instances, upholstered the chairs and fitted the \nlegs with glides and casters. The assembly operations resulted in \nthe creation of a new article of commerce.\n    The U.S. Court of International Trade has also looked at the \nessence of an article to determine whether its identity has been \nsubstantially transformed through assembly or processing. For \nexample, in Uniroyal, Inc. v. United States, 3 C.I.T. 220, 225, \n(1982), aff'd 702 F. 2d 1022 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the court held that \nimported shoe uppers added to an outer sole in the United States \nwere the ``very essence of the finished shoe'' and thus the \ncharacter of the product remained unchanged and did not undergo \nsubstantial transformation in the United States. Similarly, in \nNational Juice Products Association v. United States, 10 C.I.T. 48, \n61, 628 F. Supp. 978, 991 (1986), the court held that imported \norange juice concentrate ``imparts the essential character'' to the \ncompleted orange juice and thus was not substantially transformed \ninto a product of the United States.\n    Headquarters Ruling Letter (``HQ'') H280512, dated March 7, \n2017, considered the origin of a sit-to-stand, height adjustable \ndesktop workstation for purposes of U.S. Government procurement. The \nmain components of the sit-to-stand workstation were a Chinese-\norigin lift assembly of base metal, and a U.S.-originating laminated \nparticle board work surface and keyboard tray. The lift assembly \nprovided user-assisted lift functionality by means of spring force \nto allow adjustment of the workstation between sitting and standing \npositions. In the United States, the Chinese lift assembly was \nattached to components fabricated in the United States, including \nthe work surface, keyboard tray, right and left keyboard support \nbrackets, and metal support bar, to form the workstation. The \nprocesses in the United States included sawing, profiling, sanding, \nhot-pressing and trimming to manufacture the work surface and \nkeyboard tray as well as laser-cutting, bending and painting of the \nsheet metal components followed by final assembly of the U.S.-origin \nand the imported components. CBP determined that the imported lift \nassembly was substantially transformed as a result of the assembly \nperformed in the United States to produce the finished desktop \nworkstation. The decision noted that the lift assembly was not \nfunctional to an end user by itself as it did not include the \nprimary features of the U.S.-origin work surface and keyboard tray \nwhich allowed the work to be conducted, and without which, the \nlifting mechanism was incapable of being used as a workstation. CBP \nfound the lift assembly was substantially transformed in the United \nStates into a desktop workstation.\n    In New York Ruling Letter (``NY'') N334531, dated September 6, \n2023, CBP considered the country of origin of four unassembled \ntables, where the tabletops were manufactured in Thailand, the bases \nwere manufactured in China, and all of the components were packaged \nas unassembled tables in Thailand. Although partially unassembled, \nCBP noted that it has historically found that the material \ncomprising the tabletop imparts the essential character to a table. \nSee, e.g., NY N324295, dated February 17, 2022; NY N331972, dated \nApril 13, 2023; NY N332328, dated May 9, 2023; NY N334127, dated \nAugust 2, 2023; NY N334774, dated August 24, 2023; NY N334531, dated \nSeptember 6, 2023; and NY N336633, dated December 6, 2023. Based on \nthe totality of the manufacturing operations performed in China and \nThailand and their sequence, first in China and then in Thailand, \nand the fact that the tabletops imparted the essential character of \nthe complete tables, CBP found that the country of origin of the \nimported, unassembled tables was Thailand. See also, NY N339685, \ndated May 9, 2024 (the country of origin of three unassembled tables \nwas Thailand under similar reasoning as in NY N334531).\n    Unlike Carlson Furniture Indus. and HQ H280512, the assembly \noperations here are not as substantial in nature. Rather, they are \nakin to the manufacturing operations in NY N334531 and NY N339685. \nThe functional article of commerce that is purchased by a U.S. \ngovernment agency is not simply a tabletop or table bases that are \npackaged together but rather, a finished meeting table that merely \nnecessitates a simple combining of components without any special \nskill or sophistication. And as CBP has historically found, it is \nthe tabletop component, which provides the tables with their \nfunctionality and accounts for the majority of their weight, visual \nappeal, and utility, that imparts the essential character of a \ntable. Accordingly, the tabletop component of the Kadin and Terin \ntable configurations that are manufactured in Canada imparts the \nessential character of the imported meeting table configuration. \nThus, we find that the country of origin of the entire unassembled \nKadin and Terina table configurations as imported will be Canada for \npurposes of U.S. Government procurement.\n\nHolding\n\n    Based on the facts and analysis set forth above, the country of \norigin of the Kadin and Terina models of meeting tables will be \nCanada for purposes of U.S. Government procurement.\n    Notice of this final determination will be given in the Federal \nRegister, as required by 19 CFR 177.29. Any party-at-interest other \nthan the party which requested this final determination may request, \npursuant to 19 CFR 177.31, that CBP reexamine the matter anew and \nissue a new final determination. Pursuant to 19 CFR 177.30, any \nparty-at-interest may, within 30 days of publication of the Federal \nRegister Notice referenced above, seek judicial review of this final \ndetermination before the U.S. Court of International Trade.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlice A. Kipel,\n\nExecutive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of Trade.\n\n[FR Doc. 2025-09318 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 9111-14-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Verhey, Principal, FLG Counsel, 1717 K Street NW, Suite \n900, Washington, DC 20006\nRe: U.S. Government Procurement; Title III, Trade Agreements Act of \n1979 (19 U.S.C. 2511); Subpart B, Part 177, CBP Regulations; Country \nof Origin of Unifyia Platform Software; Substantial Transformation\nDear Mr. Verhey:\n\n    This is in response to your request, dated October 31, 2024, on \nbehalf of Unifyia, Inc. (``Unifyia''), for a final determination \nconcerning the country of origin of Unifyia Platform Software, \npursuant to Title III of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (``TAA''), \nas amended (19 U.S.C. 2511 et seq.), and subpart B of Part 177, U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection (``CBP'') Regulations (19 CFR 177.21, \net seq.). Unifyia, Inc. is a party-at-interest within the meaning of \n19 CFR 177.22(d)(1) and 177.23(a) and is therefore entitled to \nrequest this final determination.\n\nFacts\n\n    The merchandise under consideration is Unifyia Platform \nSoftware, described as software that provides identity and \ncredential management, and high assurance authentication solutions \nfor the United States Government. Unifyia's software is built using \na four-step process with the assistance of a subsidiary in India. \nThe first step is design and engineering efforts conducted by the \nUnifyia team in the United States; the second step is source code \ndevelopment by the Unifyia team in India; the third step is the \ncompilation of source code into executable object code by the same \nteam in the United States; and the last step is to secure the \nfinished software in storage on Amazon Web Services (``AWS'') for \ndeployment to government customers.\n\nStep 1\n\n    The beginning stages of the development process start in the \nUnited States. The company's U.S.-based engineers design the \nsoftware functionality and service model for the development \nprocess.\n\nStep 2\n\n    In this step, the Indian-based team, in coordination with the \nU.S. team during the development process, produces 80 percent of the \nsource code, while the remaining 20 percent is developed in the \nUnited States. The code is made to meet the requirements of the U.S. \ndesign architecture plan. The software programmers write the \ncomputer code using Java, C++, and Swift languages, while the user-\ninterface designers design and write the computer code for a \ngraphical layout using Typescript, HTML, FreeMarker, React Native, \nand JavaScript. Once completed, the India-based team uploads the \nsource code to Bitbucket, a secure U.S.-based code repository.\n    Before step 3 can begin, the U.S. team initiates code cleansing \nand debugging. This must be performed before the source code can be \ntransformed into executable code. This process is done in the United \nStates under the direction of the U.S. engineering team which \nensures that all issues are addressed. During the process, the \nsource code is modified by deleting or modifying one or more \nportions of the original source code to produce new source code.\n\nStep 3\n\n    Once cleansing and debugging are complete, the U.S. team \ninitiates the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) \nprocess. At this stage, the U.S. team authorizes the movement of the \nsource code from Bitbucket to Bitbucket Pipeline (a U.S.-based \nplatform) or to the server (U.S.-based machine), that automatically \nconverts the source code to executable object code. In the same \nprocess, the object code is released with version control for easier \nmaintenance.\n\nStep 4\n\n    Stated as the end of the CI/CD process, Unifyia in the United \nStates sends the executable object code to DockerHub, Dropbox, the \nApp Store, and/or the Play Store, all U.S.-based platforms, for \nsecure storage. The U.S. team then delivers the new object code to \nthe purchaser through AWS, a U.S.-based platform located in Ashburn, \nVirginia, that allows customers to access applications or that \nprovides secure storage for its customers.\n\nIssue\n\n    What is the country of origin of the platform software for \npurposes of U.S. Government procurement?\n\nLaw & Analysis\n\n    CBP issues country of origin advisory rulings and final \ndeterminations as to whether an article is or would be a product of \na designated country or instrumentality for the purpose of granting \nwaivers of certain ``Buy American'' restrictions in U.S. law or \npractice for products offered for sale to the U.S. Government, \npursuant to subpart B of Part 177, 19 CFR 177.21 et seq., which \nimplements Title III, Trade Agreements Act of 1979, as amended (19 \nU.S.C. 2511-2518).\n    CBP's authority to issue advisory rulings and final \ndeterminations stems from 19 U.S.C. 2515(b)(1), which states:\n    For the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary of the \nTreasury shall provide for the prompt issuance of advisory rulings \nand final determinations on whether, under section 2518(4)(B) of \nthis title, an article is or would be a product of a foreign country \nor instrumentality designated pursuant to section 2511(b) of this \ntitle.\n    Emphasis added.\n    The Secretary of the Treasury's authority mentioned above, along \nwith other customs revenue functions, are delegated to the Secretary \nof Homeland Security via Treasury Department Order (TO) 100-20 \n``Delegation of Customs revenue functions to Homeland Security,'' \ndated October 30, 2024, and are subject to further delegations to \nCBP (see also 19 CFR part 177, subpart B).\n    The rule of origin set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2518(4)(B) states:\n    An article is a product of a country or instrumentality only if \n(i) it is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of that country \nor instrumentality, or (ii) in the case of an article which consists \nin whole or in part of materials from another country or \ninstrumentality, it has been substantially transformed into a new \nand different article of commerce with a name, character, or use \ndistinct from that of the article or articles from which it was so \ntransformed.\n    See also 19 CFR 177.22(a).\n    In rendering advisory rulings and final determinations for \npurposes of U.S. Government procurement, CBP applies the provisions \nof subpart B of Part 177 consistent with the Federal Acquisition \nRegulation (``FAR''). See 19 CFR 177.21. In this regard, CBP \nrecognizes that the FAR restricts the U.S. Government's purchase of \nproducts to U.S.-made or designated country end products for \nacquisitions subject to the TAA. See 48 CFR 25.403(c)(1).\n    The FAR, 48 CFR 25.003, defines ``U.S.-made end product'' as:\n    . . . an article that is mined, produced, or manufactured in the \nUnited States or that is substantially transformed in the United \nStates into a new and different article of commerce with a name, \ncharacter, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from \nwhich it was transformed.\n    Additionally, the FAR, 48 CFR 25.003, defines ``designated \ncountry end product'' as:\n    a WTO GPA [World Trade Organization Government Procurement \nAgreement] country end product, an FTA [Free Trade Agreement] \ncountry end product, a least developed country end product, or a \nCaribbean Basin country end product.\n    Section 25.003 defines ``WTO GPA country end product'' as an \narticle that:\n    (1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a WTO GPA \ncountry; or\n    (2) In the case of an article that consists in whole or in part \nof materials from another country, has been substantially \ntransformed in a WTO GPA country into a new and different article of \ncommerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the \narticle or articles from which it was transformed. The term refers \nto a product offered for purchase under a supply contract, but for \npurposes of calculating the value of the end product includes \nservices (except transportation services) incidental to the\n\n[[Page 22109]]\n\narticle, provided that the value of those incidental services does \nnot exceed that of the article itself.\n    CBP has consistently held that conducting a software build, \ncompiling source code into object code, results in a substantial \ntransformation. In a final determination that CBP issued, \nHeadquarters Ruling Letter (``HQ'') H301776, dated Aug. 7, 2019, two \nsoftware products were produced using a four-step process: (1) \nwriting original source code, or modifying open source software code \nin the United States; (2) writing or modifying source code in \nCanada; (3) compiling the source code into executable object code in \nthe United States; and (4) delivering the finished software to the \npurchaser. In the final determination, CBP cited to two secondary \nsources to highlight how ``source code'' and ``object code'' differ \nin several important ways. Source code is a ``computer program \nwritten in a high level human readable language.'' See, e.g., Daniel \nS. Lin, Matthew Sag, and Ronald S. Laurie, Source Code versus Object \nCode: Patent Implications for the Open Source Community, 18 Santa \nClara High Tech. L.J. 235, 238 (2001). While it is easier for humans \nto read and write programs in ``high level human readable \nlanguages,'' computers cannot execute these programs. See Note, \nCopyright Protection of Computer Program Object Code, 96 Harv. L. \nRev. 1723, 1724 (1983). Computers can execute only ``object code,'' \nwhich is a program consisting of clusters of ``0'' and ``1'' \nsymbols. Id. Programmers create object code from source code by \nfeeding it into a program known as a ``compiler.'' Id. CBP held that \nthe name, character, and use of the source code were changed as a \nresult of its compilation into executable object code and its \ncompletion into finished software in the United States.\n    CBP also held in another final determination, HQ H268858, dated \nFeb. 12, 2016, that conducting a software build resulted in a \nsubstantial transformation. In that decision, four software products \nwere produced using a similar multi-stage process: (1) writing the \nsource code in Malaysia; (2) compiling the source code into usable \nobject code in the United States; and (3) installing the finished \nsoftware on U.S.-origin discs in the United States. CBP held that \nall four software products were substantially transformed in the \nUnited States, finding that the software build conducted in the \nUnited States created a new and different article with a new name, \ncharacter, and use. See also HQ H243606, dated Dec. 4, 2013 (source \ncode programmed in China and then compiled into object code in the \nUnited States was a substantial transformation).\n    In this case, the writing of source code in India (and the \nUnited States) involves the creation of computer instructions in a \nhigh level human readable language, whereas the software build \nperformed in the United States involves the compilation of those \ninstructions into a format that computers can execute. Based on the \ninformation provided, and consistent with the rulings cited above, \nwe find that as a result of the software build that occurs when the \nsource code is transformed into executable code when moved through \neither of the two U.S.-based platforms, Bitbucket Pipeline or the \nU.S.-based server, the last substantial transformation occurs in the \nUnited States. Through this process, the character changes from \ncomputer code to finished software, and the use changes from \ninstructions to an executable program. Therefore, Unifyia's software \nis not a product of a foreign country or instrumentality designated \npursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2511(b). As to whether Unifyia's software \nqualifies as a ``U.S.-made end product,'' you may wish to consult \nwith the relevant government procuring agency and review Acetris \nHealth, LLC v. United States, 949 F.3d 719 (Fed. Cir. 2020).\n\nHolding\n\n    Based on the facts and analysis set forth above, the subject \nUnifyia, Inc. platform software is last substantially transformed in \nthe United States.\n    Notice of this final determination will be given in the Federal \nRegister, as required by 19 CFR 177.29. Any party-at-interest other \nthan the party which requested this final determination may request, \npursuant to 19 CFR 177.31, that CBP reexamine the matter anew and \nissue a new final determination. Pursuant to 19 CFR 177.30, any \nparty-at-interest may, within 30 days of publication of the Federal \nRegister Notice referenced above, seek judicial review of this final \ndetermination before the U.S. Court of International Trade.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlice A. Kipel\n\nExecutive Director, Regulations & Rulings, Office of Trade\n\n[FR Doc. 2025-09321 Filed 5-22-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 9111-14-P\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"
