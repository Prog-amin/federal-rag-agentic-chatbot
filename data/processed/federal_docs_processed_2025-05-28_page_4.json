By qualitative feedback, the \nCFPB means information that provides useful insights on, for example, \ncomprehension, usability, perceptions, and opinions, but are not \nstatistical surveys that yield quantitative results that can be \ngeneralized to the population of study. The CFPB expects this feedback \nto include insights into consumer, financial institution or stakeholder \nperceptions, experiences, and expectations; provide an early warning of \nissues with service; or focus attention on areas where communication, \ntraining or changes in operations might improve delivery of products or \nservices. These collections will allow for ongoing, collaborative, and \nactionable communications between the CFPB and consumers, financial \ninstitutions, and stakeholders. It will also allow feedback to \ncontribute directly to the improvement of program management.\n    Request for Comments: The CFPB published a 60-day Federal Register \nnotice on January 17, 2025 (90 FR 5833) under Docket Number: CFPB-2025-\n0007. The CFPB is publishing this notice and soliciting comments on: \n(a) Whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper \nperformance of the functions of the CFPB, including whether the \ninformation will have practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's \nestimate of the burden of the collection of information, including the \nvalidity of the methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance \nthe quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; \nand (d) Ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on \nrespondents, including through the use of automated collection \ntechniques or other forms of information technology. Comments submitted \nin response to this notice will be reviewed by OMB as part of its \nreview of this request. All comments will become a matter of public \nrecord.\n\nAnthony May,\nPaperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09228 Filed 5-21-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4810-AM-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Executive Summary\n\nA. Does this action apply to me?\n\n    You may be potentially affected by this action if you are an \nagricultural producer, food manufacturer, or pesticide manufacturer. \nThe following list of North American Industrial Classification System \n(NAICS) codes is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather provides a \nguide to help readers determine whether this document might apply to \nthem:\n    <bullet> Crop production (NAICS code 111).\n    <bullet> Animal production (NAICS code 112).\n    <bullet> Food manufacturing (NAICS code 311).\n    <bullet> Pesticide manufacturing (NAICS code 32532).\n    If you have any questions regarding the applicability of this \nproposed action to a particular entity, consult the person listed under \nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.\n\nB. What action is the Agency taking?\n\n    EPA is proposing several tolerance actions that the Agency \npreviously determined were necessary or appropriate during registration \nreview of the pesticide active ingredients identified in Unit III. The \ntolerance actions for each pesticide active ingredient are described in \nUnit III. and may include but are not limited to the following types of \nactions:\n    <bullet> Revising tolerance expressions;\n    <bullet> Modifying commodity definitions;\n    <bullet> Updating crop groupings;\n    <bullet> Removing expired tolerances;\n    <bullet> Revoking tolerances that are no longer needed; and\n    <bullet> Harmonizing tolerances with the Codex Alimentarius \nCommission (Codex) Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs).\n    Although it may not have been identified in the registration review \nof a particular pesticide, this proposed rule\n\n[[Page 21879]]\n\nreflects the Agency's 2019 adoption of the Organization of Economic \nCooperation and Development (OECD) Rounding Class Practice. More \ninformation on the OECD Rounding Class Practice can be found at <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/mrl-calculator-users-guide-and-white-paper_9789264221567-en.html\">https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/mrl-calculator-users-guide-and-white-paper_9789264221567-en.html</a>. Where applicable, these adjustments are \nproposed for specific pesticides as indicated in Unit III.\n\nC. What is EPA's authority for taking this action?\n\n    Section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), \n21 U.S.C. 346a(e), authorizes EPA to establish, modify, or revoke \ntolerances or exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance on its own \ninitiative.\n    Under FIFRA section 3(g), 7 U.S.C. 136a(g), EPA is required to \nperiodically review all registered pesticides and determine if those \npesticides continue to meet the standard for registration under FIFRA. \nAs part of the registration review of a pesticide, EPA also evaluates \nthe existing tolerances and any tolerance changes identified as \nnecessary or appropriate during registration review of a pesticide are \nsummarized in the registration review decision documents for each \npesticide active ingredient or registration review case (e.g., in the \nProposed Interim Decision (PID), Proposed Final Decision (PFD), Interim \nDecision (ID) and Final Decision (FD)). These documents can be found in \nthe public docket opened for each pesticide undergoing registration \nreview. Additional information about pesticide registration review is \navailable at <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-reevaluation\">https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-reevaluation</a>.\n    Prior to issuing the final regulation, FFDCA section 408(e)(2) \nrequires EPA to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking for a 60-day \npublic comment period, unless the Administrator for good cause finds \nthat it would be in the public interest to have a shorter period and \nstates the reasons in the proposed rulemaking.\n\nD. What should I consider as I prepare my comments for EPA?\n\n    1. Submitting CBI. Do not submit CBI to EPA through email or \n<a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>. If you wish to include CBI in your \ncomment, please follow the applicable instructions at <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules\">https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules</a> and clearly mark the \ninformation that you claim to be CBI. Information so marked will not be \ndisclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part \n2.\n    2. Tips for preparing your comments. When preparing and submitting \nyour comments, see the commenting tips at <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets\">https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets</a>.\n\nE. What can I do if I want the Agency to maintain a tolerance that the \nAgency proposes to revoke?\n\n    This proposed rule provides a 60-day public comment period that \nallows any person to state an interest in retaining a tolerance \nproposed for revocation. If EPA receives such a comment within the 60-\nday period, EPA will not proceed to revoke the tolerance immediately. \nHowever, EPA will take steps to ensure the submission of any needed \nsupporting data and will issue an order in the Federal Register under \nFFDCA section 408(f), if needed. If the data are not submitted as \nrequired in the order, EPA will take appropriate action under FFDCA.\n    After considering comments that are received in response to this \nproposed rule, EPA will issue a final rule. At the time of the final \nrule, you may file an objection or request a hearing on the action \ntaken in the final rule. If you fail to file an objection to the final \nrule within the time period specified in the final rule, you will have \nwaived the right to raise any issues resolved in the final rule. After \nthe filing deadline specified in the final rule, issues resolved in the \nfinal rule cannot be raised again in any subsequent proceedings.\n\nII. Background\n\nA. What is a tolerance?\n\n    A ``tolerance'' represents the maximum level for residues of a \npesticide chemical legally allowed in or on food, which includes raw \nagricultural commodities and processed foods and feed for animals. \nUnder the FFDCA, residues of a pesticide chemical that are not covered \nby a tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance are \nconsidered unsafe. See 21 U.S.C. 346a(a)(1). Foods containing unsafe \nresidues are deemed adulterated and may not be distributed in \ninterstate commerce. See 21 U.S.C. 331(a) and 342(a)(2)(B). \nConsequently, for a food-use pesticide (i.e., a pesticide use that is \nlikely to result in residues in or on food) to be sold and distributed \nin the United States, the pesticide must not only have appropriate \ntolerances or exemptions under the FFDCA, but also must be registered \nunder FIFRA. Food-use pesticides not registered in the United States \nmust have tolerances or exemptions in order for commodities treated \nwith those pesticides to be imported into the United States. For \nadditional information about tolerances, go to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-tolerances/about-pesticide-tolerances\">https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-tolerances/about-pesticide-tolerances</a>.\n\nB. Why does EPA consider international residue limits?\n\n    When establishing a tolerance for residues of a pesticide, EPA must \ndetermine whether Codex has established a MRL for that pesticide. See \n21 U.S.C. 346a(b)(4). Additionally, as part the registration review of \na pesticide (see Unit II.C.), EPA determines whether Codex or other \ninternational MRLs exist for commodities and chemicals for which U.S. \ntolerances have been established. Where appropriate, EPA's intention is \nto harmonize U.S. tolerances with those international MRLs to \nfacilitate trade. EPA's effort to harmonize with international MRLs is \nsummarized in the tolerance reassessment section of the individual \nHuman Health Draft Risk Assessments that support the pesticide \nregistration review.\n\nC. What is registration review?\n\n    Under FIFRA section 3(g), 7 U.S.C. 136a(g), EPA is required to \nperiodically review all registered pesticides and determine if those \npesticides continue to meet the standard for registration under FIFRA. \nSee also 40 CFR 155.40(a). The registration review program is intended \nto make sure that, as the ability to assess risk evolves and as \npolicies and practices change, all registered pesticides can continue \nto be used without causing unreasonable adverse effects on human health \nand the environment. As part of the registration review of a pesticide, \nEPA also evaluates whether existing tolerances are safe, whether any \nchanges to existing tolerances are necessary or appropriate, and \nwhether any new tolerances are necessary to cover residues from \nregistered pesticides. In addition, any tolerance changes identified as \nnecessary or appropriate during registration review of a pesticide are \nsummarized in the registration review decision documents for each \npesticide active ingredient or registration review case (e.g., in the \nProposed Interim Decision (PID), Proposed Final Decision (PFD), Interim \nDecision (ID) and Final Decision (FD)). These documents can be found in \nthe public docket that has been opened for each pesticide, which is \navailable online at <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>, using the docket ID \nnumber listed in Unit III. for each pesticide active ingredient \nincluded in this proposed action. Additional information about \npesticide registration review is available at\n\n[[Page 21880]]\n\n<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-reevaluation\">https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-reevaluation</a>.\n\nD. EPA's Safety Assessments\n\n    FFDCA section 408(b) authorizes EPA to establish a tolerance, if \nthe Agency determines that a tolerance is safe; FFDCA section 408(c) \nauthorizes EPA to establish an exemption from the requirement of a \ntolerance if the Agency determines that the exemption is safe. See 21 \nU.S.C. 346a(b) and (c). If EPA determines that a tolerance or exemption \nis not safe, EPA must modify or revoke that tolerance or exemption. The \nFFDCA defines ``safe'' to mean that ``there is a reasonable certainty \nthat no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide \nchemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all \nother exposures for which there is reliable information.'' 21 U.S.C. \n346a(b)(2)(A)(ii), (c)(2)(A)(ii). This includes exposure through \ndrinking water and in residential settings but does not include \noccupational exposure. FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(C) requires EPA to give \nspecial consideration to the exposure of infants and children to the \npesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to ``ensure \nthat there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to \ninfants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical \nresidue[s.]'' 21 U.S.C. 346a(b)(2)(C). In addition, FFDCA section \n408(b)(2)(D) contains several factors EPA must consider when making \ndeterminations about establishing, modifying, or revoking tolerances. \n21 U.S.C. 346a(b)(2)(D). FFDCA section 408(c)(2)(B) requires that EPA, \nwhen making determinations about exemptions, to take into account, \namong other things, the considerations set forth in FFDCA section \n408(b)(2)(C) and (D). 21 U.S.C. 346a(c)(2)(B).\n    Furthermore, when establishing tolerances or exemptions from the \nrequirement of a tolerance, FFDCA sections 408(b)(3) and (c)(3) require \nthat there be a practical method for detecting and measuring pesticide \nchemical residue levels in or on food, unless in the case of \nexemptions, EPA determines that such method is not needed and states \nthe reasons therefore in the rulemaking. 21 U.S.C. 346a(b) and (c).\n    Consistent with its obligations under FIFRA section 3(g), 7 U.S.C. \n136a(g), and FFDCA section 408, 21 U.S.C. 346a, EPA has reviewed the \navailable scientific data and other relevant information on toxicity \nand exposure of the individual chemicals represented in this \nrulemaking. As part of registration review, the Agency has published \nrisk assessments detailing the risks from aggregate exposure, including \nto infants and children, for each of the pesticides represented herein. \nThe chemical-specific toxicity and exposure analyses, which support the \nsafety determinations contained in Unit III., can be found in the human \nhealth risk assessment documents and related registration review \ndecision documents, which are available in the public docket that has \nbeen opened for each pesticide, as noted in Unit III.\n    After considering all available information, EPA has determined it \nis appropriate based on the underlying safety assessments to take the \ntolerance actions being proposed in this rulemaking and that adequate \nenforcement methodology as described in the supporting documents is \navailable to enforce the tolerance expressions.\n\nIII. Proposed Tolerance Actions\n\n    EPA is proposing to take the specific tolerance actions identified \nin this unit. All tolerance values proposed in the regulatory text of \nthis rulemaking, modified or otherwise, are being proposed to reflect \ncurrent OECD rounding practices.\n\nA. 40 CFR 180.190; Diphenylamine; Case 2210 (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OPP-\n2015-0749)\n\n    EPA is proposing to amend the current tolerances by:\n    <bullet> Revising the tolerance expression in paragraph (a) for \ndiphenylamine to describe more clearly the scope or coverage of the \ntolerances and the method for measuring compliance. Consistent with EPA \npolicy, the revised tolerance expression would clarify that (1) as \nprovided in FFDCA section 408(a)(3), the tolerances cover residues of \nthe pesticide chemical, including its metabolites and degradates; and \n(2) compliance with the specified tolerance levels is to be determined \nby measuring the specific compounds mentioned in the tolerance \nexpression. The revisions to the tolerance expression would not \nsubstantively change the tolerances or, in any way, modify the \npermissible level of residues permitted by the tolerances.\n    <bullet> Revising the commodity definition in paragraph (a) from \n``Apple from preharvest or postharvest use, including use of \nimpregnated wraps'' to ``Apple'' and from ``Pear (post-harvest)'' to \n``Pear''. These revisions of commodity definitions will help facilitate \nefficient commodity searches and does not substantively change the \ntolerance or, in any way, modify the permissible level of residues in \nor on the commodity listed in the regulation.\n    <bullet> Revoking the tolerances from paragraph (a) for ``Cattle, \nfat'' at 0.01 ppm; ``Cattle, liver'' at 0.1 ppm; ``Cattle, meat \nbyproducts, except liver'' at 0.01 ppm; ``Cattle, meat'' at 0.01 ppm; \n``Goat, fat'' at 0.01 ppm; ``Goat, liver'' at 0.1 ppm; ``Goat, meat \nbyproducts, except liver'' at 0.01 ppm; ``Goat, meat'' at 0.01 ppm; \n``Horse, fat'' at 0.01 ppm; ``Horse, liver'' at 0.1 ppm; ``Horse, meat \nbyproducts, except liver'' at 0.01 ppm; ``Horse, meat'' at 0.01 ppm; \n``Milk'' at 0.01 ppm; ``Sheep, fat'' at 0.01 ppm; ``Sheep, liver'' at \n0.1 ppm; ``Sheep, meat byproducts, except liver'' at 0.01 ppm; and \n``Sheep, meat'' at 0.01 ppm. During Registration Review it was \ndetermined that these entries should be removed since the tolerances \nare no longer needed based on revised amounts of pomace in livestock \ndiets.\n    <bullet> Modifying tolerances by removing trailing zeros to reflect \ncurrent OECD rounding practices.\n    As discussed in Unit II.D, based on the supporting registration \nreview documents, EPA has determined that the proposed amendments to \nthe diphenylamine tolerances would be safe, i.e., there is a reasonable \ncertainty that no harm will result to the general population, or \nspecifically to infants and children, from aggregate exposure to \ndiphenylamine residues. Adequate enforcement methodology is available.\n\nB. 40 CFR 180.377; Diflubenzuron; Case 0144 (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OPP-\n2012-0714)\n\n    EPA is proposing to amend the current tolerances by:\n    <bullet> Establishing a new tolerance in paragraph (a)(1) for \n``Cotton, gin byproducts'' at 30 ppm as supported by submitted residue \ndata.\n    <bullet> Revising the commodity definitions in paragraph (a)(1) \nfrom ``Soybean'' to ``Soybean, seed'' and in paragraph (a)(2) from \n``Citrus, oil'' to ``Fruit, citrus, group 10-10, oil''. These revisions \nof commodity definitions will help facilitate efficient commodity \nsearches and does not substantively change the tolerance or, in any \nway, modify the permissible level of residues in or on the commodity \nlisted in the regulation.\n    <bullet> Modifying the tolerance value in paragraph (a)(1) for \n``Mushroom'' from 0.2 ppm to 8 ppm as supported by submitted residue \ndata.\n    <bullet> Updating existing crop group tolerances in paragraph \n(a)(2) for residues of diflubenzuron from ``Brassica, leafy greens, \nsubgroup 5B'' to the updated crop group ``Brassica, leafy greens, \nsubgroup 4-16B''. The newly established ``Brassica, leafy greens, \nsubgroup 4-16B'' will have an updated (harmonized) tolerance level of \n10 ppm.\n\n[[Page 21881]]\n\n    40 CFR 180.40(j) states that ``At appropriate times, EPA will amend \ntolerances for crop groups that have been superseded by revised crop \ngroups to conform the pre-existing crop group to the revised crop \ngroup.'' EPA has indicated in updates to its crop group rulemakings \nthat registration review is one of those appropriate times. See, e.g., \nTolerance Crop Grouping Program V (85 FR 70985, November 6, 2020 (FRL-\n10015-19)).\n    <bullet> EPA has identified opportunities to harmonize with Codex \nMRLs for diflubenzuron and is proposing to modify the tolerance values \nin paragraph (a)(1) for ``Cattle, fat'', ``Cattle, meat'', ``Goat, \nfat'', ``Goat, meat'', ``Hog, fat'', ``Hog, meat'', ``Horse, fat'', \n``Horse, meat'', ``Sheep, fat'', and ``Sheep, meat'' from 0.05 ppm to \n0.1 ppm and in paragraph (a)(2) for the newly established crop group \n``Brassica, leafy greens, subgroup 4-16B'' from 9 ppm to 10 ppm.\n    <bullet> Removing the time-limited tolerances from paragraph (b) \nfor ``Alfalfa, forage'' at 6.0 ppm; ``Alfalfa, hay'' at 6.0 ppm; and \n``Lemon'' at 0.8 ppm since the tolerances are expired.\n    <bullet> Modifying tolerances by removing trailing zeros to reflect \ncurrent OECD rounding practices.\n    As discussed in Unit II.D., based on the supporting registration \nreview documents, EPA has determined that the proposed amendments to \nthe diflubenzuron tolerances would be safe, i.e., there is a reasonable \ncertainty that no harm will result to the general population, or \nspecifically to infants and children, from aggregate exposure to \ndiflubenzuron residues. Adequate enforcement methodology is available.\n\nC. 40 CFR 180.484; Flutolanil; Case 7010 (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OPP-\n2008-0148)\n\n    EPA is proposing to amend the current tolerances by:\n    <bullet> Revoking the tolerance from paragraph (a) for ``Rice, \nhulls'' at 25.0 ppm. During Registration Review it was determined that \nthis tolerance should be removed since it is no longer considered a \nsignificant livestock feed item.\n    <bullet> Modifying tolerance values in paragraph (a) for ``Peanut, \nhay'' from 15.0 ppm to 20 ppm based on OECD tolerance calculation \nprocedures on ``Peanut, hay'', including residues from both band and \nbroadcast applications.\n    <bullet> Modifying tolerance values in paragraph (a) for ``Turnip \ngreens'' from 0.1 ppm to 0.2 ppm, and ``Vegetable, brassica, leafy, \ngroup 5'' from 0.1 ppm to 0.2 ppm based on reconsideration of previous \nrecommendations, because detectable residues of parent were found in \none field trial on mustard greens.\n    <bullet> Modifying tolerances by removing trailing zeros to reflect \ncurrent OECD rounding practices.\n    As discussed in Unit II.D., based on the supporting registration \nreview documents, EPA has determined that the proposed amendments to \nthe flutolanil tolerances would be safe, i.e., there is a reasonable \ncertainty that no harm will result to the general population, or \nspecifically to infants and children, from aggregate exposure to \nflutolanil residues. Adequate enforcement methodology is available.\n\nD. 40 CFR 180.537; Isoxaflutole; Case 7242 (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OPP-\n2010-0979)\n\n    EPA is proposing to amend the current tolerances by:\n    <bullet> Modifying the tolerance value for ``Grain, aspirated \nfractions'' by removing the trailing zero to reflect current OECD \nrounding practices.\n    As discussed in Unit II.D., based on the supporting registration \nreview documents, EPA has determined that the proposed amendments to \nthe isoxaflutole tolerances would be safe, i.e., there is a reasonable \ncertainty that no harm will result to the general population, or \nspecifically to infants and children, from aggregate exposure to \nisoxaflutole residues. Adequate enforcement methodology is available.\n\nE. 40 CFR 180.587; Famoxadone; Case 7038 (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OPP-\n2015-0094)\n\n    EPA is proposing to amend the current tolerances by:\n    <bullet> Revising the tolerance expressions in paragraphs (a) and \n(c) for famoxadone to describe more clearly the scope or coverage of \nthe tolerances and the method for measuring compliance. Consistent with \nEPA policy, the revised tolerance expressions would clarify that (1) as \nprovided in FFDCA section 408(a)(3), the tolerances cover metabolites \nand degradates of famoxadone not specifically mentioned; and (2) \ncompliance with the specified tolerance levels is to be determined by \nmeasuring the specific compounds mentioned in the tolerance expression. \nThe revisions to the tolerance expressions would not substantively \nchange the tolerances or, in any way, modify the permissible level of \nresidues permitted by the tolerances.\n    <bullet> Where appropriate, it is the Agency's intention to \nharmonize U.S. tolerances with those international MRLs to facilitate \ntrade. EPA has identified opportunities to harmonize with Codex MRLs \nfor famoxadone and is proposing to increase the ``Grape, raisin'' \ntolerance from 4.0 ppm to 5 ppm.\n    <bullet> Revising the commodity definition in paragraph (a) from \n``Milk, fat (reflecting negligible residues in whole milk)'' to ``Milk, \nfat''. This revision of commodity definition will help facilitate \nefficient commodity searches and does not substantively change the \ntolerance or, in any way, modify the permissible level of residues in \nor on the commodity listed in the regulation.\n    <bullet> Updating existing crop group tolerances in paragraph (a) \nfor residues of famoxadone: from ``Vegetable, fruiting, group 8, except \ntomato'' to the updated crop group ``Vegetable, fruiting, group 8-10, \nexcept tomato'' at the same residue levels; and from ``Vegetable, \nleafy, except Brassica, group 4, except spinach'' to the two updated \ncrop groups ``Leafy greens subgroup 4-16A, except spinach'' and ``Leaf \npetiole vegetable subgroup 22B'' at the same residue levels. The Agency \nis proposing to establish tolerances for the commodities ``Arugula'', \n``Cress, garden'', ``Cress, upland'', ``Celtuce'', and ``Fennel, \nflorence, fresh leaves and stalk'' at 25 ppm that have been displaced \nby the updating of the current ``Vegetable, fruiting, group 8, except \ntomato'' and ``Vegetable, leafy, except Brassica, group 4, except \nspinach'' crop groups. Upon establishment of these new crop groups, and \nto prevent redundancy, the Agency proposes to remove tolerances that \nwill be unnecessary once they are superseded by the tolerances \nestablished for the new crop group, including the tolerances for \n``Cilantro, leaves'' that will now be covered under the updated crop \ngrouping ``Leafy greens subgroup 4-16A, except spinach''.\n    40 CFR 180.40(j) states that ``At appropriate times, EPA will amend \ntolerances for crop groups that have been superseded by revised crop \ngroups to conform the pre-existing crop group to the revised crop \ngroup.'' EPA has indicated in updates to its crop group rulemakings \nthat registration review is one of those appropriate times. See, e.g., \nTolerance Crop Grouping Program V (85 FR 70985, November 6, 2020 (FRL-\n10015-19)).\n    <bullet> Modifying tolerance values in paragraph (a) for \n``Tomato'', ``Grape, raisin'', and ``Vegetable, cucurbit, group 9'' by \nremoving trailing zeros to reflect current OECD rounding practices.\n    As discussed in Unit II.D., based on the supporting registration \nreview documents, EPA has determined that the proposed amendments to \nthe famoxadone tolerances would be safe, i.e., there is a reasonable \ncertainty that\n\n[[Page 21882]]\n\nno harm will result to the general population, or specifically to \ninfants and children, from aggregate exposure to famoxadone residues. \nAdequate enforcement methodology is available.\n\nF. 40 CFR 180.610; Aminopyralid; Case 7267 (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OPP-\n2013-0749)\n\n    EPA is proposing to amend the current tolerances by:\n    <bullet> Modifying tolerance values for ``Corn, field, forage'', \n``Corn, field, grain'', ``Corn, field, stover'', ``Wheat, forage'', and \n``Wheat, hay'' by removing trailing zeros to reflect current OECD \nrounding practices. Additionally, modifying the tolerance values for \n``Wheat, straw'' by rounding to the nearest tenth decimal to reflect \ncurrent OECD rounding practice.\n    As discussed in Unit II.D, based on the supporting registration \nreview documents, EPA has determined that the proposed amendments to \nthe aminopyralid tolerances would be safe, i.e., there is a reasonable \ncertainty that no harm will result to the general population, or \nspecifically to infants and children, from aggregate exposure to \naminopyralid residues. Adequate enforcement methodology is available.\n\nG. 40 CFR 180.632; Fenazaquin; Case 7447 (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OPP-\n2020-0081)\n\n    EPA is proposing to amend the current tolerances by:\n    <bullet> Removing the tolerance from paragraph (a) for ``Fruit, \nCitrus, Group 10 except Grapefruit'' at 0.5 ppm, which has expired.\n    <bullet> Where appropriate, it is the Agency's intention to \nharmonize U.S. tolerances with those international MRLs to facilitate \ntrade. EPA has identified opportunities to harmonize with Japanese MRLs \nfor fenazaquin and is proposing to increase the ``Tea, dried'' \ntolerance from 9 ppm to 10 ppm and to establish a ``Tea, instant'' \ntolerance at 10 ppm.\n    As discussed in Unit II.D., based on the supporting registration \nreview documents, EPA has determined that the proposed amendments to \nthe fenazaquin tolerances would be safe, i.e., there is a reasonable \ncertainty that no harm will result to the general population, or \nspecifically to infants and children, from aggregate exposure to \nfenazaquin residues. Adequate enforcement methodology is available.\n\nH. 40 CFR 180.634; Tembotrione; Case 7273 (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OPP-\n2016-0063)\n\n    EPA is proposing to amend the current tolerances by:\n    <bullet> Modifying tolerances by removing trailing zeros to reflect \ncurrent OECD rounding practices.\n    As discussed in Unit II.D., based on the supporting registration \nreview documents, EPA has determined that the proposed amendments to \nthe tembotrione tolerances would be safe, i.e., there is a reasonable \ncertainty that no harm will result to the general population, or \nspecifically to infants and children, from aggregate exposure to \ntembotrione residues. Adequate enforcement methodology is available.\n\nIV. Proposed Effective and Expiration Date(s)\n\n    EPA is proposing that these tolerance actions would be effective on \nthe date of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. For \nactions in the final rule that lower or revoke existing tolerances, EPA \nis proposing to add an expiration date to the existing tolerance that \nis six months after the date of publication of the final rule in the \nFederal Register, to allow a reasonable interval for producers in \nexporting members of the World Trade Organization's Sanitary and \nPhytosanitary Measures Agreement to adapt to the requirements.\n\nV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\n\n    Additional information about these statutes and Executive Orders \ncan be found at <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/laws-and-executive-orders\">https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/laws-and-executive-orders</a>.\n\nA. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n    This action is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866 (58 \nFR 51735, October 4, 1993), because it proposes to establish or modify \na pesticide tolerance or a tolerance exemption under FFDCA section 408. \nThis exemption also applies to tolerance revocations for which \nextraordinary circumstances do not exist. As such, this exemption \napplies to the tolerance revocations in this proposed rule because the \nAgency knows of no extraordinary circumstances that warrant \nreconsideration of this exemption for those proposed tolerance \nrevocations.\n\nB. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation\n\n    Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) does not apply \nbecause actions that establish a tolerance under FFDCA section 408 are \nexempted from review under Executive Order 12866.\n\nC. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)\n\n    This action does not impose an information collection burden under \nthe PRA 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., because it does not contain any \ninformation collection activities.\n\nD. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)\n\n    I certify that this action will not have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the RFA, 5 \nU.S.C. 601 et seq. In making this determination, EPA concludes that the \nimpact of concern for this action is any significant adverse economic \nimpact on small entities and that the Agency is certifying that this \naction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial \nnumber of small entities because the action has no net burden on small \nentities subject to this rulemaking. This determination takes into \naccount an EPA analysis for tolerance establishments and modifications \nthat published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950 \n(FRL-1809-5)) and for tolerance revocations on December 17, 1997 (62 FR \n66020 (FRL-5753-1)). Additionally, in a 2001 memorandum, EPA determined \nthat eight conditions must all be satisfied in order for an import \ntolerance or tolerance exemption revocation to adversely affect a \nsignificant number of small entity importers, and that there is a \nnegligible joint probability of all eight conditions holding \nsimultaneously with respect to any particular revocation. See \nMemorandum from Denise Keehner, Division Director, Biological and \nEconomic Analysis Division, Office of Pesticide Programs, entitled \n``RFA/SBREFA Certification for Import Tolerance Revocation'' and dated \nMay 25, 2001, which is available in docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OPP-2005-0322 \nat <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.\n    For the pesticides named in this rulemaking, EPA concludes that \nthere is no reasonable expectation that residues of the pesticides for \ntolerances listed in this rulemaking for revocation will be found on \nthe commodities discussed in this rulemaking, and the Agency knows of \nno extraordinary circumstances that exist as to the present proposed \nrule that would change EPA's previous analyses.\n    Any comments about the Agency's determination for this rulemaking \nshould be submitted to EPA along with comments on the proposed rule and \nwill be addressed in the final rule.\n\nE. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA)\n\n    This action does not contain an unfunded mandate of $100 million or\n\n[[Page 21883]]\n\nmore (in 1995 dollars and adjusted annually for inflation) as described \nin UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538, and does not significantly or uniquely \naffect small governments. The action imposes no enforceable duty on any \nstate, local or tribal governments or the private sector.\n\nF. Executive Order 13132: Federalism\n\n    This action does not have federalism implications as specified in \nExecutive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), because it will \nnot have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship \nbetween the national government and the states, or on the distribution \nof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\n\nG. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian \nTribal Governments\n\n    This action does not have tribal implications as specified in \nExecutive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), because it will \nnot have substantial direct effects on tribal governments, on the \nrelationship between the Federal government and the Indian tribes, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal \ngovernment and Indian tribes.\n\nH. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental \nHealth Risks and Safety Risks\n\n    This action is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, \nApril 23, 1997) because it is not a significant regulatory action under \nsection 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 (See Unit V.A.), and because \nEPA does not believe the environmental health or safety risks addressed \nby this action present a disproportionate risk to children. However, \nEPA's 2021 Policy on Children's Health applies to this action.\n    This rulemaking proposes tolerance actions under the FFDCA, which \nrequires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and \nchildren to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance \nand to ``ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will \nresult to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide \nchemical residue . . .'' (FFDCA 408(b)(2)(C)). The Agency's \nconsideration is documented in the pesticide-specific registration \nreview documents, located in each chemical docket at <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.\n\nI. Executive Order 13211: Actions Concerning Regulations That \nSignificantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution or Use\n\n    This action is not subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, \nMay 22, 2001) because it is not a significant regulatory action under \nExecutive Order 12866.\n\nJ. National Technology Transfer Advancement Act (NTTAA)\n\n    This action does not involve technical standards that would require \nAgency consideration under NTTAA section 12(d), 15 U.S.C. 272.\n\nList of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180\n\n    Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, \nAgricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements.\n\n    Dated: May 13, 2025.\nEdward Messina,\nDirector, Office of Pesticide Programs.\n\n    For the reasons set forth in the preamble, EPA is proposing to \namend 40 CFR chapter I as follows:\n\nPART 180--TOLERANCES AND EXEMPTIONS FOR PESTICIDE CHEMICAL RESIDUES \nIN FOOD\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  21 U.S.C. 321(q), 346a and 371.\n\n0\n2.

Effectiveness will be measured by how \nwell a consumer can understand various dimensions of each loan by \nanswering comprehension questions (e.g., interest rate, payment \nschedule, etc.) for various types of construction-to-permanent and \nconstruction loans they are presented. Per the recommendation of the \nCFPB, to ensure the effectiveness of both the survey instrument and the \nrevised mortgage disclosure forms, ICBA's contractor, will conduct pre-\ntesting (or cognitive-testing) of both.\n    Request for Comments: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the \ncollection of information is necessary for the proper performance of \nthe functions of the CFPB, including whether the information will have \npractical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's estimate of the \nburden of the collection of information, including the validity of the \nmethods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, \nutility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) Ways \nto minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, \nincluding through the use of automated collection techniques or other \nforms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this \nnotice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB's \napproval. All comments will become a matter of public record.\n\nAnthony May,\nPaperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09227 Filed 5-21-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4810-AM-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

AD 2015-02-14 required repetitive \ninspections for cracking, damage, correct installation, and correct \nadjustment of the main landing gear (MLG) door hinge and actuator \nfittings on the keel beam, corrective actions if necessary, and \nrevision of the existing maintenance or inspection program, as \napplicable. Since the FAA issued AD 2015-02-14, a new design of the MLG \ndoor keel beam hinge and actuator fitting was developed. This AD \ncontinues to require the actions specified in AD 2015-02-14, adds an \noptional terminating action, and revises the applicability, as \nspecified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which \nis incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the \nunsafe condition on these products.\n\nDATES: This AD is effective June 26, 2025.\n    The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by \nreference of a certain publication listed in this AD as of June 26, \n2025.\n\nADDRESSES: \n    AD Docket: You may examine the AD docket at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under \nDocket No. 2024-2661; or in person at Docket Operations between 9 a.m. \nand 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

AD 2015-02-14 applied to all \nAirbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -\n114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, \n-231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -\n212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2015-02-14 required repetitive \ninspections for cracking, damage, correct installation, and correct \nadjustment of the MLG door hinge and actuator fittings on the keel \nbeam; corrective actions if necessary; and revision of the existing \nmaintenance or inspection program, as applicable. The FAA issued AD \n2015-02-14 to detect and correct cracking on the MLG door hinge fitting \nand actuator fitting on the keel beam, which could lead to in-flight \ndetachment of an MLG door, possibly resulting in injury to persons on \nthe ground and/or damage to the airplane.\n    The NPRM was published in the Federal Register on December 17, 2024 \n(89 FR 102016). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2024-0097R2, dated July 12, \n2024 (EASA AD 2024-0097R2) (also referred to as the MCAI), which \nsuperseded EASA AD 2012-0118, dated July 4, 2012 (which corresponds to \nFAA AD 2015-02-14), issued by EASA, which is the Technical Agent for \nthe Member States of the European Union. The MCAI states that after \nEASA AD 2012-0118 was issued, a new design of the MLG door keel beam \nhinge and actuator fitting was certified for current engine option \n(CEO) airplanes (Model A318-111, A318-112, A318-121, A318-122; A319-\n111, A319-112, A319-113, A319-114, A319-115, A319-131, A319-132, A319-\n133; A320-211, A320-212, A320-214, A320-215, A320-216, A320-231, A320-\n232, A320-233; and A321-111, A321-112, A321-131, A321-211, A321-212, \nA321-213, A321-231, and A321-232 airplanes) and new engine option (NEO) \nairplanes (Model A319-151N, A319-153N, A319-171N; A320-251N, A320-252N, \nA320-253N, A320-271N, A320-272N, A320-273N; A321-251N, A321-251NX, \nA321-252N, A321-252NX, A321-253N, A321-253NX, A321-271N, A321-271NX, \nA321-272N, and A321-272NX airplanes). The MCAI states that the \napplicability is expanded to include the NEO airplanes which are \nsubject to the same unsafe condition. Model A320-215 airplanes are not \ncertificated by the FAA and are not included on the U.S. type \ncertificate data sheet; this AD therefore does not include those \nairplanes in the applicability.\n    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to continue to require the actions \nspecified in AD 2015-02-14, add an optional terminating action, and \nrevise the applicability, as specified in EASA AD 2024-0097R2. The FAA \nis issuing this AD to detect and correct cracking on the MLG door hinge \nfitting and actuator fitting on the keel beam, which could lead to in-\nflight detachment of a MLG door, possibly resulting in injury to \npersons on the ground and/or damage to the airplane.\n    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under \nDocket No. FAA-2024-2661.\n\nDiscussion of Final Airworthiness Directive\n\nComments\n\n    The FAA received comments from the Air Line Pilots Association, \nInternational (ALPA) and United Airlines, who supported the NPRM \nwithout change.\n    The FAA received additional comments from American Airlines (AA), \nDelta Air Lines (Delta), and Spirit Airlines. The following presents \nthe comments received on the NPRM and the FAA's response to each \ncomment.\n\nRequest To Correct a Typographical Error\n\n    AA and Delta requested the FAA revise paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of the \nproposed AD to read ``AMOCs approved previously for FAA AD 2015-02-14 \nare approved as AMOCs for the corresponding provisions of EASA AD 2024-\n0097R2 that are required by paragraph (g) of this AD.'' (Paragraph \n(k)(1)(ii) of the proposed AD inadvertently referenced EASA AD 2012-\n0118, instead of EASA AD 2024-0097R2.)\n    The FAA agrees and has revised paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this AD \naccordingly.\n\nRequest To Clarify Superseding Relationship Between Airworthiness \nLimitations Tasks and Airbus Service Bulletins\n\n    Spirit Airlines requested that when the FAA issues an AD to \nincorporate Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) Part 2, Revision 11 \n(which is scheduled for release November 2024), it include a caveat or \nclarification detailing the superseding relationship between \nAirworthiness Limitations (ALI) tasks 533154-10-1 and 533154-03-2, and \nAirbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1195, Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-\n1325, Airbus Service Bulletin\n\n[[Page 21843]]\n\nA320-53-1196, and Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1326. Spirit Airlines \nstated that it will not be able to incorporate ALI tasks 533154-10-1 \nand 533154-03-2 and Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1195, Airbus \nService Bulletin A320-53-1325, Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1196, \nand Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1326 simultaneously, and a clear \nexplanation will help avoid any confusion or conflicts when \nimplementing the updated AD.\n    The FAA does not agree with the request. Airbus will update the ALS \nas needed to address the superseding relationship between ALI tasks \n533154-10-1 and 533154-03-2, and Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1195, \nAirbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1325, Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-\n1196, and Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1326. The FAA has not changed \nthis AD in this regard.\n\nRequest for a Grace Period\n\n    Delta requested the FAA allow a 3-month grace period to comply with \nthe initial inspection requirements in paragraphs (1) and (2) of EASA \nAD 2024-0097R2 for NEO airplanes. Delta requested this grace period to \ncontinue to use ALI task 533154-03-2 in lieu of Airbus Service Bulletin \nA320-53-1325, as referenced in paragraph (1) of EASA AD 2024-0097R2; \nand to continue to use ALI task 533154-04-2 or ALI task 533154-10-1 in \nlieu of Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1326 referenced in paragraph \n(2) of EASA AD 2024-0097R2. Delta noted that ALI tasks are mandatory \ninspections; therefore, until the final rule is issued, U.S. operators \nwould have no authority to use those service bulletins in lieu of those \nALI inspections. Delta stated that the current language in the proposed \nAD would require, from the effective date of the AD, that operators \nimmediately switch from the ALI tasks to the Airbus service bulletins. \nDelta added that this could be logistically very difficult, especially \nif the ALI inspection is being performed on several airplanes on the \nAD's effective date.\n    The FAA agrees to include a grace period for the transition for NEO \nairplanes only. CEO airplanes have been subject to the compliance times \nspecified in AD 2015-02-14 and therefore do not need a grace period. \nThe FAA has added paragraphs (h)(6) and (7) to this AD accordingly.\n\nRequest To Remove Ultrasonic Inspection\n\n    AA requested the FAA revise paragraph (g) of the proposed AD to \nrequire operators to also comply with the changes detailed in Airbus \nService Bulletin Information Transmission/Operators Information \nTransmission (SBIT/OIT) 23-0074, Revision 01, dated June 7, 2024. \nAirbus SBIT/OIT 23-0074 removes the ``ultrasonic'' inspection wording \nfrom Airbus Service Bulletin A320-53-1196 and Airbus Service Bulletin \nA320-53-1326. AA stated that the Non-Destructive Testing Manual (NTM) \nreferenced in the Airbus service bulletins does not contain ultrasonic \ninspection instructions.\n    The FAA agrees that the ultrasonic inspection is not necessary and \nhas added paragraph (h)(8) of this AD to clarify the requirement \naccordingly.\n\nAdditional Changes to This AD\n\n    The FAA revised paragraph (i) of this AD, including removing \nparagraphs (i)(1) and (2) of the proposed AD. The FAA determined that \nthe actions specified in paragraph (i) of this AD are only applicable \nto the CEO airplanes, since the NEO airplanes are not in the ALI \ndocuments specified in paragraph (i) of this AD.\n\nConclusion\n\n    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority \nof another country and are approved for operation in the United States. \nPursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design \nAuthority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition \ndescribed in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant \ndata, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety \nrequires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing \nthis AD to address the unsafe condition on this product. Except for \nminor editorial changes, and any other changes described previously, \nthis AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. None of the changes will \nincrease the economic burden on any operator.\n\nMaterial Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51\n\n    EASA AD 2024-0097R2 specifies procedures for repetitive detailed \nvisual, high frequency eddy current (HFEC), and ultrasonic inspections \nof the MLG door actuator fittings on the keel beam for discrepancies \n(cracks, wear marks, migration of the plain bush, loose flanged bush, \nand other damage). Corrective actions include replacement of the \naffected MLG door actuator fitting, modification of the actuator and \nhinge fittings at the MLG door, and repair of any cracks, loose flanged \nbush axial, bush migration, wear marks underneath the bolt head, and \nother damage on the left and right sides of the airplane.\n    EASA AD 2024-0097R2 also specifies procedures for repetitive \ndetailed visual and HFEC inspections of the MLG door hinge fittings on \nthe keel beam for discrepancies (cracks, migration of the plain bush, \nwear marks, and other damage). Corrective actions include replacement \nof the MLG door hinge fitting, modification of the actuator and hinge \nfittings at the MLG door, and repair of any bush migration, wear marks \nunderneath the bolt head, and other damage on the left and right sides \nof the airplane.\n    EASA AD 2024-0097R2 also specifies procedures for modifying the \nactuator and hinge fittings at the MLG door for the following parts: \nMLG actuator fittings, hinge fittings, and connecting plates between \nframe (FR) 42 and FR 43; accomplishment of this modification terminates \nthe repetitive inspections.\n    This material is reasonably available because the interested \nparties have access to it through their normal course of business or by \nthe means identified in the ADDRESSES section.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\n    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 1,766 airplanes of U.S. \nregistry.\n    The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:\n\n                                      Estimated Costs for Required Actions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                     Cost per      Cost on U.S.\n                 Action                          Labor cost           Parts cost      product        operators\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInspections............................  20 work-hours x $85 per              $0          $1,700      $3,002,200\n                                          hour = $1,700.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page 21844]]\n\n\n                                      Estimated Costs for Optional Actions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                     Cost per\n                     Action                                  Labor cost               Parts cost      product\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nModify the actuator and hinge fittings at MLG    82 work-hours x $85 per hour =          $52,000         $58,970\n door.                                            $6,970.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any fitting replacement \nthat would be required based on the results of any required actions. \nThe FAA has no way of determining the number of aircraft that might \nneed a fitting replacement:\n\n                 Estimated Costs of On-Condition Actions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           Labor cost                Parts cost       Cost per product\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n38 work-hours x $85 per hour =            $6,742                 $9,972\n $3,230.........................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The FAA has received no definitive data on which to base the cost \nestimates for the repairs specified in this AD.\n    According to the manufacturer, some or all of the costs of this AD \nmay be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the cost impact on \naffected individuals. The FAA does not control warranty coverage for \naffected individuals. As a result, the FAA has included all known costs \nin the cost estimate.\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to \nissue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order \n13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, \non the relationship between the national government and the States, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \nlevels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866,\n    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or \nnegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1.

Model EMB-145, -145ER, -145MR, -\n145LR, -145XR, -145MP, and -145EP airplanes. AD 2006-20-08 required \nrepetitive inspections to detect cracking or failure of the rod ends \nand fittings of the aileron power control actuator (PCA), and \ncorrective actions if necessary, and provided an optional terminating \naction. This AD was prompted by a determination that there was an error \nin identifying a maintenance task number.

AD 2006-20-08 applied to all \nEmbraer Model EMB-145, -145ER, -145MR, -145LR, -145XR, -145MP, and -\n145EP airplanes. AD 2006-20-08 required repetitive inspections to \ndetect cracking or failure/breaking of the rod ends and fittings of the \naileron PCA, and corrective actions if necessary, and provided an \noptional terminating action for the requirements. The FAA issued AD \n2006-20-08 to detect and correct cracking or breaking of the rod ends \nand connecting fittings of the aileron PCA, which could result in \nreduced controllability of the airplane.\n    The NPRM published in the Federal Register on January 31, 2025 (90 \nFR 8684). The NPRM was prompted by AD 1999-02-01R7, effective May 6, \n2024; as corrected October 11, 2024 (ANAC AD 1999-02-01R7) (also \nreferred to as the MCAI), issued by ANAC, which is the aviation \nauthority for Brazil. The MCAI states that after ANAC AD 1999-02-01R6 \nwas issued it was identified that the visual inspection task number \nreferenced on requirement (c) of that AD (AMM TASK 27-12-01-212-002-\nA00, ``Aileron PCA Rod Ends/Fitting, Lugs for Integrity and General \nCondition'') was incorrect. ANAC AD 1999-02-01R7 was issued to replace \nthe task reference to MRB-145/1150 TASK 27-12-01-212-002-A05. For \nairplanes identified in paragraph (c) of ANAC AD 1999-02-01R7, \naccomplishing repetitive inspections as specified in MRB-145/1150 TASK \n27-12-01-212-002-A05 are necessary to address the unsafe condition.\n    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to continue to require the actions in \nAD 2006-20-08 and correct an error in a task number, as specified in \nANAC AD 1999-02-01R7. The FAA is issuing this AD to address cracking or \nbreaking of the rod ends and connecting fittings of the aileron PCA, \nwhich could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.\n    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under \nDocket No. FAA-2025-0010.\n\nDiscussion of Final Airworthiness Directive\n\nComments\n\n    The FAA received comments from the Air Line Pilots Association, \nInternational (ALPA) who supported the NPRM without change.\n\nConclusion\n\n    This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another \ncountry and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to \nthe FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, it \nhas notified the FAA of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI \nreferenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant data, considered the \ncomment received, and determined that air safety requires adopting this \nAD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing this AD to address the \nunsafe condition on this product. Except for minor editorial changes, \nthis AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. None of the changes will \nincrease the economic burden on any operator.\n\nMaterial Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51\n\n    ANAC AD 1999-02-01R7 specifies procedures for repetitive \ninspections to detect cracking and failure of the rod ends and PCA \nfittings of the aileron PCA and corrective actions if necessary, and \nprovides an optional terminating action. Corrective actions include \nreplacing cracked and failed rod ends and PCA fittings.

The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:\n\n[[Page 21847]]\n\n\n\n                                      Estimated Costs For Required Actions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                     Cost per      Cost on U.S.\n              Action                      Labor cost             Parts cost           product        operators\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRetained actions from AD 2006-20-   1 work-hour x $85 per  None.................             $85         $23,120\n 08.                                 hour = $85.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                  Estimated Costs for Optional Actions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           Labor cost                Parts cost      Cost per  product\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n24 work-hours x $85 per hour =           $19,817                $21,857\n $2,040.........................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any necessary on-\ncondition actions that would be required based on the results of any \nrequired actions. The FAA has no way of determining the number of \naircraft that might need these on-condition actions:\n\n                 Estimated Costs of On-Condition Actions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           Labor cost                Parts cost      Cost per  product\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n24 work-hours x $85 per hour =           $19,817                $21,857\n $2,040.........................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to \nissue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order \n13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, \non the relationship between the national government and the States, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \nlevels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866,\n    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or \nnegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n\n\nSec.  39.13  [Amended]\n\n0\n2. The FAA amends Sec.  39.13 by:\n0\na.

The NPRM was published in the Federal Register on February \n11, 2025 (90 FR 9291). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2024-0151, dated \nJuly 31, 2024, issued by EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the \nMember States of the European Union (EASA AD 2024-0151) (also referred \nto as the MCAI). The MCAI states an erroneous value of the MLG tire \nwidth has been identified in the aircraft data files used for aircraft \nperformance computation. The MLG tire width is used for the calculation \nof performance on contaminated runways (water, slush, dry snow, and wet \nsnow runway states), especially for drag modelling. An erroneous value \nof the MLG tire width, if not corrected, could result in the erroneous \ncalculation of certain data, including, but not limited to, takeoff \ndistance and accelerate stop distance, possibly leading to runway \nexcursions.\n    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to require revising the existing AFM \nto incorporate a CPDF update, as specified in EASA AD 2024-0151. The \nFAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these \nproducts. You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> \nunder Docket No. FAA-2025-0197.\n\nDiscussion of Final Airworthiness Directive\n\nComments\n\n    The FAA received comments from United Airlines and the Air Lines \nPilot Association, International, who supported the NPRM without \nchange.\n\nChanges Made From the NPRM\n\n    Since the NPRM published, the FAA realized the language in the MCAI \nregarding the CPDF update may be confusing. As a result, the FAA added \nparagraph (h)(3) of this AD to clarify that this AD requires revising \nthe AFM to include the updated CPDF pages.\n    The FAA also added paragraph (h)(4) of this AD to clarify that, in \norder to use a later AFM revision to comply with this AD, the content \nmust be identical (not similar) to the information in the updated CPDF \npages.\n\nConclusion\n\n    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority \nof another country and are approved for operation in the United States. \nPursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design \nAuthority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition \ndescribed in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant \ndata, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety \nrequires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing \nthis AD to address the unsafe condition on this product. Except for \nminor editorial changes, and any other changes described previously, \nthis AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. None of the changes will \nincrease the economic burden on any operator.\n\nMaterial Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51\n\n    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2024-0151. This material specifies \nprocedures for revising the existing AFM to incorporate a CPDF update. \nThis material is reasonably available because the interested parties \nhave access to it through their normal course of business or by the \nmeans identified in the ADDRESSES section.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\n    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 742 airplanes of U.S. \nregistry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:\n\n                                      Estimated Costs for Required Actions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                    Cost per       Cost on U.S.\n                          Labor cost                              Parts cost        product         operators\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 work-hour x $85 per hour = $85.............................              $0              $85          $63,070\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page 21850]]\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to \nissue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order \n13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, \non the relationship between the national government and the States, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \nlevels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866,\n    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or \nnegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n\n\nSec.  39.13   [Amended]\n\n0\n2. The FAA amends Sec.  39.13 by adding the following new airworthiness \ndirective:\n\n2025-10-05 Airbus SAS: Amendment 39-23039; Docket No. FAA-2025-0197; \nProject Identifier MCAI-2024-00440-T.\n\n(a) Effective Date\n\n    This airworthiness directive (AD) is effective June 26, 2025.\n\n(b) Affected ADs\n\n    None.\n\n(c) Applicability\n\n    This AD applies to all Airbus SAS Model A321-111, -112, -131, -\n211, -212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, -\n251NX, -252NX, -253NX, -271NX, and -272NX airplanes, certificated in \nany category.\n\n(d) Subject\n\n    Air Transport Association (ATA) of America Code 32, Landing \ngear.\n\n(e) Unsafe Condition\n\n    This AD was prompted by the identification of an erroneous value \nof the main landing gear (MLG) tire width in the aircraft data files \nused for aircraft performance computation. The FAA is issuing this \nAD to correct an erroneous value of the MLG tire width used to \ncalculate aircraft performance on a contaminated runway. This unsafe \ncondition, if not corrected, could result in the erroneous \ncalculation of certain data, including, but not limited to, takeoff \ndistance and accelerate stop distance, possibly leading to runway \nexcursions.\n\n(f) Compliance\n\n    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, \nunless already done.\n\n(g) Requirements\n\n    Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this AD: Comply with all \nrequired actions and compliance times specified in, and in \naccordance with, European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD \n2024-0151, dated July 31, 2024 (EASA AD 2024-0151).\n\n(h) Exceptions to EASA AD 2024-0151\n\n    (1) Where EASA AD 2024-0151 refers to its effective date, this \nAD requires using the effective date of this AD.\n    (2) Where paragraph (1) of EASA AD 2024-0151 specifies to \n``inform all flight crews, and, thereafter, operate the aeroplane \naccordingly,'' this AD does not require those actions as those \nactions are already required by existing FAA operating regulations \n(see 14 CFR 91.9, 14 CFR 91.505, and 14 CFR 121.137).\n    (3) Where paragraph (1) of EASA AD 2024-0151 specifies \n``implement the CPDF update in the AFM'', this AD requires replacing \nthat text with ``revise the existing AFM by incorporating the CPDF \nupdate''.\n    (4) Where paragraph (2) of EASA AD 2024-0151 specifies ``which \nincludes the same content as in the CPDF update'', this AD requires \nreplacing that text with ``which includes information identical to \nthe information in the CPDF update''.\n    (5) This AD does not adopt the ``Remarks'' section of EASA AD \n2024-0151.\n\n(i) Additional AD Provisions\n\n    The following provisions also apply to this AD:\n    (1) Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs): The Manager, AIR-\n520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA, has the authority to \napprove AMOCs for this AD, if requested using the procedures found \nin 14 CFR 39.19. In accordance with 14 CFR 39.19, send your request \nto your principal inspector or responsible Flight Standards Office, \nas appropriate. If sending information directly to the manager of \nthe Continued Operational Safety Branch, send it to the attention of \nthe person identified in paragraph (j) of this AD and email to: \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#02434f4d41426463632c656d74\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"b4f5f9fbf7f4d2d5d59ad3dbc2\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Before using any approved AMOC, notify your \nappropriate principal inspector, or lacking a principal inspector, \nthe manager of the responsible Flight Standards Office.\n    (2) Contacting the Manufacturer: For any requirement in this AD \nto obtain instructions from a manufacturer, the instructions must be \naccomplished using a method approved by the Manager, AIR-520, \nContinued Operational Safety Branch, FAA; or EASA; or Airbus SAS's \nEASA Design Organization Approval (DOA). If approved by the DOA, the \napproval must include the DOA-authorized signature.\n    (3) Required for Compliance (RC): Except as required by \nparagraph (i)(2) of this AD, if any material contains procedures or \ntests that are identified as RC, those procedures and tests must be \ndone to comply with this AD; any procedures or tests that are not \nidentified as RC are recommended. Those procedures and tests that \nare not identified as RC may be deviated from using accepted methods \nin accordance with the operator's maintenance or inspection program \nwithout obtaining approval of an AMOC, provided the procedures and \ntests identified as RC can be done and the airplane can be put back \nin an airworthy condition.

AD 2023-10-08 required \nrevising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, \nto incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since \nthe FAA issued AD 2023-10-08, the FAA has determined that new or more \nrestrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues \nto require certain actions in AD 2023-10-08 and requires revising the \nexisting maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to \nincorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as \nspecified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which \nis incorporated by reference.

AD 2023-10-08 applied to all \nATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-200, -300, and \n-320 airplanes. AD 2023-10-08 required revising the existing \nmaintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or \nmore restrictive maintenance requirements and airworthiness \nlimitations. The FAA issued AD 2023-10-08 to prevent reduced structural \nintegrity of the airplane.\n    The NPRM was published in the Federal Register on February 13, 2025 \n(90 FR 9529). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2024-0121, dated June 27, \n2024 (EASA AD 2024-0121) (also referred to as the MCAI), issued by \nEASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the \nEuropean Union. The MCAI states that new or more restrictive \nairworthiness limitations have been developed.\n    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to continue to require certain \nrequirements of AD 2023-10-08. The FAA also proposed to require \nrevising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, \nto incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness \nlimitations, as specified in EASA AD 2024-0121. The FAA is issuing this \nAD to address the unsafe condition on these products.\n    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under \nDocket No. FAA-2025-0201.\n\nDiscussion of Final Airworthiness Directive\n\nComments\n\n    The FAA received no comments on the NPRM or on the determination of \nthe cost to the public.\n\nConclusion\n\n    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority \nof another country and are approved for operation in the United States. \nPursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design \nAuthority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition \ndescribed in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant \ndata, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety \nrequires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing \nthis AD to address the unsafe condition on this product. Except for \nminor editorial changes, this AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. \nNone of the changes will increase the economic burden on any operator.\n\nMaterial Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51\n\n    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2024-0121. This material specifies new or \nmore restrictive airworthiness limitations for airplane structures and \nsafe life limits.\n    This AD also requires EASA AD 2022-0199, dated September 26, 2022, \nwhich the Director of the Federal Register approved for incorporation \nby reference as of July 11, 2023 (88 FR 36928, June 6, 2023).\n    This material is reasonably available because the interested \nparties have access to it through their normal course of business or by \nthe means identified in the ADDRESSES section.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\n    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 22 airplanes of U.S. \nregistry. The\n\n[[Page 21852]]\n\nFAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:\n    The FAA estimates the total cost per operator for the retained \nactions from AD 2023-10-08 to be $7,650 (90 work-hours x $85 per work-\nhour).\n    The FAA has determined that revising the existing maintenance or \ninspection program takes an average of 90 work-hours per operator, \nalthough the agency recognizes that this number may vary from operator \nto operator. Since operators incorporate maintenance or inspection \nprogram changes for their affected fleet(s), the FAA has determined \nthat a per-operator estimate is more accurate than a per-airplane \nestimate.\n    The FAA estimates the total cost per operator for the new actions \nto be $7,650 (90 work-hours x $85 per work-hour).\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to \nissue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order \n13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, \non the relationship between the national government and the States, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \nlevels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866,\n    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or \nnegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n\n\nSec.  39.13  [Amended]\n\n0\n2. The FAA amends Sec.  39.13 by:\n0\na.

The NPRM was published in the \nFederal Register on February 19, 2025 (90 FR 9881). The NPRM was \nprompted by AD 2024-0180, dated September 17, 2024, issued by EASA, \nwhich is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European \nUnion (EASA AD 2024-0180) (also referred to as the MCAI). The MCAI \nstates that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations have been \ndeveloped.\n    In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to require revising the existing \nmaintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or \nmore restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in EASA AD \n2024-0180. The FAA also proposed to terminate the limitations required \nby paragraph (j) of AD 2024-01-05 for the tasks identified in the \nmaterial referenced in EASA AD 2024-0180 only. The FAA is issuing this \nAD to address the potential of ignition sources inside fuel tanks, \nwhich, in combination with flammable fuel vapors, could result in a \nfuel tank explosion and consequent loss of the airplane.\n    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under \nDocket No. FAA-2025-0205.\n\n[[Page 21854]]\n\nDiscussion of Final Airworthiness Directive\n\nComments\n\n    The FAA received comments from two commenters including Air Line \nPilots Association, International (ALPA), and an individual who \nsupported the NPRM without change.\n\nConclusion\n\n    These products have been approved by the civil aviation authority \nof another country and are approved for operation in the United States. \nPursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design \nAuthority, that authority has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition \ndescribed in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant \ndata, considered any comments received, and determined that air safety \nrequires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing \nthis AD to address the unsafe condition on this product. Except for \nminor editorial changes, this AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. \nNone of the changes will increase the economic burden on any operator.\n\nMaterial Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51\n\n    The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2024-0180. This material specifies new or \nmore restrictive airworthiness limitations for fuel tank ignition \nprevention and fuel tank flammability reduction that include revising a \ncertain Critical Design Configuration Control Limitation (CDCCL) to \ninclude the additional dimensional values for fuel pumps and existing \nO-rings in the auxiliary power unit (APU) pump. This material is \nreasonably available because the interested parties have access to it \nthrough their normal course of business or by the means identified in \nthe ADDRESSES section.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\n    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 33 airplanes of U.S. \nregistry. The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:\n    The FAA has determined that revising the existing maintenance or \ninspection program takes an average of 90 work-hours per operator, \nalthough the agency recognizes that this number may vary from operator \nto operator. Since operators incorporate maintenance or inspection \nprogram changes for their affected fleet(s), the FAA has determined \nthat a per-operator estimate is more accurate than a per-airplane \nestimate. Therefore, the agency estimates the average total cost per \noperator to be $7,650 (90 work-hours x $85 per work-hour).\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to \nissue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order \n13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, \non the relationship between the national government and the States, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \nlevels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866,\n    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or \nnegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n\n\nSec.  39.13  [Amended]\n\n0\n2.

The FAA is \nissuing this AD to address the potential of ignition sources inside \nfuel tanks. The unsafe condition, if not addressed, could result in \na fuel tank explosion and consequent loss of the airplane.\n\n(f) Compliance\n\n    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, \nunless already done.\n\n(g) Requirements\n\n    Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this AD: Comply with all \nrequired actions and compliance times specified in, and in \naccordance with, European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD \n2024-0180, dated September 17, 2024 (EASA AD 2024-0180).\n\n(h) Exceptions to EASA AD 2024-0180\n\n    (1) This AD does not adopt the requirements specified in \nparagraphs (1) and (2) of EASA AD 2024-0180.\n    (2) Paragraph (3) of EASA AD 2024-0180 specifies revising the \napproved AMP, within 12 months after its effective date, but this AD \nrequires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as \napplicable, within 90 days after the effective date of this AD.\n    (3) The initial compliance time for doing the tasks specified in \nparagraph (3) of EASA AD 2024-0180 is at the applicable limitations \nand associated thresholds as incorporated by the requirements of \nparagraph (3) of EASA AD 2024-0180, or within 90 days after the \neffective date of this AD, whichever occurs later.\n    (4) This AD does not adopt the provisions specified in \nparagraphs (4) of EASA AD 2024-0180.\n    (5) This AD does not adopt the ``Remarks'' section of EASA AD \n2024-0180.\n\n[[Page 21855]]\n\n(i) Provisions for Alternative Actions, Intervals, and Critical Design \nConfiguration Control Limitations (CDCCLs)\n\n    After the existing maintenance or inspection program has been \nrevised as required by paragraph (g) of this AD, no alternative \nactions (e.g., inspections), intervals, and CDCCLs are allowed \nunless they are approved as specified in the provisions of the \n``Ref. Publications'' section of EASA AD 2024-0180.\n\n(j) Terminating Action for Certain Tasks Required by AD 2024-01-05\n\n    Accomplishing the actions required by this AD terminates the \ncorresponding requirements of AD 2024-01-05 for the tasks identified \nin the material referenced in EASA AD 2024-0180 only.\n\n(k) Additional AD Provisions\n\n    The following provisions also apply to this AD:\n    (1) Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs): The Manager, AIR-\n520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA, has the authority to \napprove AMOCs for this AD, if requested using the procedures found \nin 14 CFR 39.19.

The NPRM \nwas published in the Federal Register on July 10, 2024 (89 FR 56674). \nThe NPRM was prompted by a report from the manufacturer that during \ndisassembly, the retention features of the inner and outer support air \nducts on GE Model CF34-10E series engines were found to have failed. \nThe retention features include a retaining ring, which becomes \nplastically deformed during installation. Vibrations loosen the \nretaining ring until it disengages. With the retaining ring disengaged, \nthe outer support air duct has no radial constraint, and releases and \nmigrates due to gravity, impacting the inner wall of the combustion \ncase causing case wall damage. If this damage has been repaired in the \npast and after the repair\n\n[[Page 21856]]\n\nthe support air duct liberates and causes more damage, then the \nremaining wall thickness is not sufficient to sustain the loading from \na fan-blade-out or other extreme event. In the NPRM, the FAA proposed \nto require a visual inspection of the combustion case for wear and \ngouges, repair if necessary, and rework of the affected HPT shroud/LPT \nnozzle assemblies to add a positive retention of the support air duct.\n    The FAA issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) \nto amend 14 CFR part 39 by adding an AD that would apply to all GE \nModel CF34-10E2A1, CF34-10E5, CF34-10E5A1, CF34-10E6, CF34-10E6A1, \nCF34-10E7, and CF34-10E7-B engines with an installed HPT shroud/LPT \nnozzle assembly having P/N 2205M38G01, 2205M38G02, 2205M38G03, \n2205M38G04, or 2205M38G05. The SNPRM was published in the Federal \nRegister on January 23, 2025 (90 FR 7998). The SNPRM was prompted by \ncomments received on the NPRM from GE and Japan Airlines requesting the \naddition of GE Model CF34-10E5 and CF34-10E5A1 engines to the \napplicability of the NPRM. In response to these comments, the FAA \ndetermined that additional model engines are affected by the unsafe \ncondition and, as a result, should be added to the applicability \nparagraph of this AD. The SNPRM proposed to require a visual inspection \nof the combustion case for wear and gouges, repair if necessary, and \nrework of the affected HPT shroud/LPT nozzle assemblies to add a \npositive retention of the support air duct. The FAA is issuing this AD \nto address the unsafe condition on these products.\n\nDiscussion of Final Airworthiness Directive\n\nComments\n\n    The FAA received comments from one individual commenter. The \nfollowing presents the comments received on the SNPRM and the FAA's \nresponse to the comments.\n\nRequest To Evaluate Economic Impact on Small Entities\n\n    An individual commenter requested that the FAA evaluate the \neconomic impact of compliance with the proposed AD, particularly on \nsmaller operators, and explore cost-effective solutions like \nalternative repair procedures or extended compliance windows where \nsafety permits. The commenter also recommended that the FAA consider \nadditional guidance on streamlined approval processes for alternative \nmethods of compliance (AMOCs) in order to allow for flexibility in \naddressing wear and damage while maintaining rigorous safety standards. \nThe commenter noted that the estimated cost of compliance, particularly \nin cases requiring full combustion case replacement, could impose a \nfinancial burden on affected carriers.\n    The FAA acknowledges the commenter's concerns and notes that \nflexibility in compliance with an AD is allowed through a request for \nan AMOC, allowed through the procedures in paragraph (i) of this AD. \nThe unsafe condition addressed in this AD includes failure of the \ncombustion case, which could result in possible engine separation and \nloss of the airplane. Inspections and repairs are therefore necessary \nto detect and repair any wear and gouges on the combustion case before \nthey lead to structural failure. The FAA did not change this AD as a \nresult of this comment.\n\nConclusion\n\n    The FAA reviewed the relevant data, considered any comments \nreceived, and determined that air safety requires adopting this AD as \nproposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe \ncondition on these products. Except for minor editorial changes, this \nAD is adopted as proposed in the SNPRM. None of the changes will \nincrease the economic burden on any operator.\n\nMaterial Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51\n\n    The FAA reviewed GE CF34-10E Service Bulletin 72-0351 R01, dated \nJuly 17, 2019, which specifies procedures for a visual inspection of \nthe combustion case for wear and gouges, repair if necessary, and \nrework of the affected HPT shroud/LPT nozzle assemblies. This material \nalso introduces a new HPT shroud/LPT nozzle assembly P/N 2205M38G07 \nwith welded retaining rings. This material is reasonably available \nbecause the interested parties have access to it through their normal \ncourse of business or by the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\n    The FAA estimates that this AD affects 221 engines installed on \nairplanes of U.S. registry.\n    The FAA estimates the following costs to comply with this AD:\n\n                                                 Estimated Costs\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                        Cost per   Cost on U.S.\n                  Action                             Labor cost            Parts cost   product      operators\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVisual inspection of the combustion case    8 work-hours x $85 per hour            $0       $680        $150,280\n inner shell surface.                        = $680.\nRework of the affected HPT shroud/LPT       8 work-hours x 85 per hour =            0        680         150,280\n nozzle assembly.                            680.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any necessary repairs \nthat would be required based on the results of the inspection.

Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order \n13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, \non the relationship between the national government and the States, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \nlevels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866,\n    (2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n    (3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or \nnegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1.

AD 2019-19-13 requires determining the total hours time-\nin-service (TIS) of the free wheel shafts of certain main rotor \ngearboxes (MGBs), replacing the MGB or right-hand side (RH) free wheel \nshaft, installing placard(s), and revising the Rotorcraft Flight Manual \n(RFM) for the helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-19-13, an \nadditional part-numbered MGB has been identified to have the same \nunsafe condition and the FAA determined that additional changes are \nnecessary. This proposed AD would require the actions of AD 2019-19-13 \nand, expand the applicability by adding the additional part-numbered \nMGB, change the requirement to determine the total hours TIS of a \ncertain free wheel shaft, require repetitive replacement of the MGB or \nthe RH free wheel shaft, change the requirements for who can replace \nparts, and expand the parts installation limitation conditions. The FAA \nis proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.\n\nDATES: The FAA must receive comments on this NPRM by July 7, 2025.\n\nADDRESSES: You may send comments, using the procedures found in 14 CFR \n11.43 and 11.45, by any of the following methods:\n    <bullet> Federal eRulemaking Portal: Go to <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a>.

Please mark each page of your submission containing \nCBI as ``PROPIN.'' The FAA will treat such marked submissions as \nconfidential under the FOIA, and they will not be placed in the public \ndocket of this NPRM. Submissions containing CBI should be sent to Frank \nHuynh, Aviation Safety Engineer, FAA, 1600 Stewart Avenue, Suite 410, \nWestbury, NY 11590. Any commentary that the FAA receives which is not \nspecifically designated as CBI will be placed in the public docket for \nthis rulemaking.\n\nBackground\n\n    The FAA issued AD 2019-19-13, Amendment 39-19749 (84 FR 56109, \nOctober 21, 2019) (AD 2019-19-13), for Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP \nhelicopters, with a MGB part number (P/N) 332A325001.XX, 332A325002.XX, \nor 332A325003.XX, with a main reduction gear module (main module), and \nwith a certain modification installed. AD 2019-19-13 was prompted by \nEuropean Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD No. 2019-0152-E, dated \nJune 28, 2019 (EASA AD 2019-0152-E), issued by EASA, which is the \nTechnical Agent for the Member States of the European Union, to correct \nan unsafe condition for Airbus Helicopters Model EC 225 LP helicopters.\n    AD 2019-19-13 requires determining the total hours TIS of each free \nwheel shaft and depending on the calculation, replacing the MGB with an \nairworthy MGB or replacing the RH free wheel shaft. AD 2019-19-13 also \nrequires installing placard(s) in full view of both pilots and revising \nthe RFM for the\n\n[[Page 21872]]\n\nhelicopter with one engine inoperative (OEI) OEI training procedures \npertaining to the ``TRAINING IDLE'' switches. As an option, AD 2019-19-\n13 specifies installing alternate MGB configurations that would \nconstitute terminating action for the requirements of AD 2019-19-13.\n    The FAA issued AD 2019-19-13 to detect and prevent wear of the \nramps of the RH side free wheel shaft.\n\nActions Since AD 2019-19-13 Was Issued\n\n    Since the FAA issued AD 2019-19-13, EASA issued EASA AD 2023-0148, \ndated July 19, 2023 (EASA AD 2023-0148) (also referred to as the MCAI), \nto supersede EASA AD 2019-0152-E. The MCAI states that since EASA AD \n2019-0152-E was issued, it was determined that an additional part-\nnumbered MGB is potentially affected by the same unsafe condition and \nexpanded the affected parts by adding MGB P/N 332A32-5004-00 with main \nmodule P/N 332A32-5400-00 installed.\n    Additionally, the FAA has determined that repetitive replacement of \nthe MGB is necessary and is requiring repetitive replacement of the MGB \nor the RH free wheel shaft at the 1,000 total hours TIS threshold. The \nFAA is also updating the actions that require replacing certain parts \nunder the supervision of a qualified Airbus Helicopter Specialist by \nremoving the requirement for the specified specialist since the actions \nmust be accomplished by persons authorized under 14 CFR 43.3. The FAA \nhas also changed the information that specifies availability of an \nexample of the placard required by this proposed AD. Further, the FAA \nexpanded the parts installation limitation conditions. Lastly, this \nNPRM uses an updated format; as a result, paragraph identifiers have \nchanged. Finally, the FAA removed the requirement to determine the \ntotal hours TIS of the left-hand (LH) free wheel shaft.\n    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under \nDocket No. FAA-2025-0909.\n\nComments to AD 2019-19-13\n\n    After AD 2019-19-13 was published, the FAA received a comment from \none commenter. The following presents the comments received on the NPRM \nand the FAA's response to the comment.\n    The commenter stated the FAA AD is not in line with the intention \nof the Airbus Helicopters Alert Service Bulletin or the EASA AD. \nSpecifically, the commenter stated the restriction that required the \nuse of the RH free wheel shaft total hours TIS if the LH and RH free \nwheel shaft hours are different is not listed by Airbus or applied by \nEASA. Furthermore, the commenter stated, there are cases where the LH \nfree wheel shaft has higher hours TIS than the RH free wheel shaft and \nthe helicopter is ``still flying as long as the RH Free wheel is under \n1000 TSI''.\n    The FAA infers the commenter is requesting that the FAA remove all \nrequired actions involving the LH free wheel shaft from the NPRM. The \nFAA agrees and has removed all wording involving the LH free wheel \nshaft from this NPRM.\n\nRelated Material\n\n    The FAA reviewed Airbus Helicopters Emergency Alert Service \nBulletin No. EC225-04A016, Revision 4, dated June 19, 2023, which \nspecifies procedures for determining the total hours TIS of the free \nwheel shafts, a life limit schedule, and procedures for replacing the \nMGB or RH free wheel shaft, and installing one or two labels (placards) \nin view of both pilots about OEI training procedures.\n\nFAA's Determination\n\n    These products have been approved by the aviation authority of \nanother country and are approved for operation in the United States. \nPursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design \nAuthority, it has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition described in \nthe MCAI referenced above. Except for minor editorial changes and any \nother changes described previously, the FAA is issuing this NPRM after \ndetermining that the unsafe condition described previously is likely to \nexist or develop on other products of the same type design.\n\nProposed AD Requirements in This NPRM\n\n    This proposed AD would retain none of the requirements of AD 2019-\n19-13, would require some of the actions required by AD 2019-19-03, and \nwould require the actions discussed under ``Actions Since AD 2019-19-13 \nwas Issued.''\n    This proposed AD would also require revising the existing RFM for \nthe helicopter. Revising the existing RFM for the helicopter may be \nperformed by the owner/operator (pilot) holding at least a private \npilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft records showing \ncompliance with this action in accordance with 14 CFR 43.9(a) and \n91.417(a)(2)(v). The pilot may perform this action because it only \ninvolves revising the existing RFM by inserting pages, which is not \nconsidered a maintenance action.\n\nDifferences Between This Proposed AD and the MCAI\n\n    This proposed AD would require revising the existing RFM for the \nhelicopter, whereas the MCAI does not. The MCAI requires reporting \ninformation, whereas this proposed AD would not.\n\nInterim Action\n\n    The FAA considers that this proposed AD would be an interim action. \nIf final action is later identified, the FAA might consider further \nrulemaking.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\n    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would \naffect 28 helicopters of U.S. registry. The FAA estimates the following \ncosts to comply with this proposed AD. Labor costs are estimated at $85 \nper hour.\n    Determining the total hours TIS of each free wheel shaft would take \n0.25 work-hour, for an estimated cost of $21 per helicopter and $588 \nfor the U.S. fleet.\n    Installing placard(s) and revising the existing RFM for the \nhelicopter would take 0.5 work-hour for an estimated cost of $43 per \nhelicopter and $1,204 for the U.S. fleet.\n    Replacing an MGB would take 40 work-hours and parts would cost \n$850,000 (overhauled), for an estimated cost of $853,400 per \nhelicopter, per replacement cycle.\n    Alternatively, replacing the RH free wheel shaft would take 4 work-\nhours and parts would cost $24,021, for an estimated cost of $24,361 \nper helicopter, per replacement cycle.\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to \nissue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\n[[Page 21873]]\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism \nimplications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not \nhave a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship \nbetween the national Government and the States, or on the distribution \nof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that the proposed \nregulation:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866,\n    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or \nnegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Proposed Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n\n\nSec.  39.13  [Amended]\n\n0\n2. The FAA amends Sec.  39.13 by:\n0\na. Removing Airworthiness Directive 2019-19-13, Amendment 39-19749 (84 \nFR 56109, October 21, 2019); and\n0\nb. Adding the following new airworthiness directive:\n\nAirbus Helicopters: Docket No. FAA-2025-0909; Project Identifier \nMCAI-2023-00895-R.\n\n(a) Comments Due Date\n\n    The FAA must receive comments on this airworthiness directive \n(AD) by July 7, 2025.\n\n(b) Affected ADs\n\n    This AD replaces AD 2019-19-13, Amendment 39-19749 (84 FR 56109, \nOctober 21, 2019) (AD 2019-19-13).\n\n(c) Applicability\n\n    This AD applies to Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters, \ncertificated in any category, with the parts identified in \nparagraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this AD installed, with ``XX'' denoting \nany dash number.\n    (1) With a main rotor gearbox (MGB) part number (P/N) 332A32-\n5001-XX, 332A32-5002-XX, or 332A32-5003-XX, with a main reduction \ngear module (main module), with modification (MOD) 07-53016 (16-\nroller free wheel of free wheel shaft P/N 332A322191.20) installed, \nP/N 332A32-5011-XX, 332A32-5012-XX, or 332A32-5013-XX.\n    (2) With an MGB P/N 332A32-5004-XX with a main module P/N \n332A32-5400-00.\n\n(d) Subject\n\n    Joint Aircraft System Component (JASC) Code 6320, Main rotor \ngear box; and 6300, Main rotor drive system.\n\n(e) Unsafe Condition\n\n    This AD was prompted by a report of wear detected on the right-\nhand side (RH) free wheel shaft. In addition, since AD 2019-19-13 \nwas issued, the FAA has determined that additional parts are \naffected by the same unsafe condition. The FAA is issuing this AD to \nprevent wear of the ramps of the right-hand side (RH) free wheel \nshaft. During an in-flight shutdown of the left-hand side engine, \nthis unsafe condition, if not addressed, could result in reduced \nability to transfer one engine inoperative (OEI) power from the RH \nengine to the main rotor, and subsequent reduced control of the \nhelicopter.\n\n(f) Compliance\n\n    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, \nunless already done.\n\n(g) Required Actions\n\n    (1) Within 10 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective \ndate of this AD, determine the total hours TIS of the RH free wheel \nshaft since new or last RH free wheel shaft replacement during \noverhaul.\n    (i) If the total hours TIS of the RH free wheel shaft is 1,000 \nor more hours TIS, before further flight, replace the MGB or replace \nthe RH free wheel shaft. Thereafter, before any RH free wheel shaft \naccumulates 1,000 total hours TIS, replace the MGB or replace the RH \nfree wheel shaft.\n    (ii) If the total hours TIS of the RH free wheel shaft is less \nthan 1,000 hours TIS, before exceeding 1,000 hours TIS, and \nthereafter before any RH free wheel shaft accumulates 1,000 total \nhours TIS, replace the MGB or replace the RH free wheel shaft.\n    (2) Within 10 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD:\n    (i) Install one or two self-adhesive placards on the instrument \npanel in full view of the pilot and co-pilot with 6-millimeter red \nletters on a white background that state the information contained \nin figure 1 to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this AD.\n\n    Note 1 to paragraph (g)(2)(i): Figure 4 of Airbus Helicopters \nEmergency Alert Service Bulletin No. EC225-04A016, Revision 4, dated \nJune 19, 2023, shows an example of this placard.\n\n\n                     Figure 1 to Paragraph (g)(2)(i)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe use of ENG1 ``TRAINING IDLE'' switch is prohibited.\n \nENG2 ``TRAINING IDLE'' switch must be systematically used.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    (ii) After installing the placard(s) required by paragraph \n(g)(2)(i) of this AD, before further flight, revise the limitations \nsection of the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for the \nhelicopter by adding the information in figure 2 to paragraph \n(g)(2)(ii) of this AD, by inserting a copy of this AD, or by making \npen-and-ink changes. The owner/operator (pilot) holding at least a \nprivate pilot certificate may revise the existing RFM and must enter \ncompliance with this RFM revision into the helicopter maintenance \nrecords in accordance with 14 CFR 43.9 (a) and 14 CFR \n91.417(a)(2)(v).

Subtitle I, Section 106, \ndescribes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, \nAviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's \nauthority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described \nin Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, \nthe FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of \nairspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient \nuse of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority, \nas it would amend Class D and E airspace in Hickory and Morganton, NC.\n\nComments Invited\n\n    The FAA invites interested persons to participate in this \nrulemaking by submitting written comments, data, or views. Comments are \nspecifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, \nenvironmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal.

An informal docket may also be examined during \nregular business hours at the office of the Eastern Service Center, \nFederal Aviation Administration, Room 210, 1701 Columbia Ave., College \nPark, GA, 30337.\n\nIncorporation by Reference\n\n    Class D and Class E airspace designations are published in \nparagraphs 5000, 6002, 6004, and 6005 of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace \nDesignations and Reporting Points, which is incorporated by reference \nin 14 CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This document proposes to amend the \ncurrent version of that order, FAA Order JO 7400.11J, dated July 31, \n2024, and effective September 15, 2024. These updates would be \npublished in the next update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA Order JO \n7400.11J is publicly available as listed in the ADDRESSES section of \nthis document.\n    FAA Order JO 7400.11J lists Class A, B, C, D, and E airspace areas, \nair traffic service routes, and reporting points.\n\nThe Proposal\n\n    This action proposes an amendment to 14 CFR part 71 to amend the \nClass D and E airspace at Hickory Regional Airport, Hickory, NC, and \nClass E airspace at Foothills Regional Airport, Morganton, NC. \nControlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of IFR \noperations in the area for existing instrument approaches.\n    This action proposes to amend the Class D and Class E2 airspace at \nHickory Regional Airport by increasing the radius from 4.1-miles to \n4.6-miles and by establishing an extension to the surface area that is \nwithin 2 miles each side of the 235[deg] bearing of Tawba \nNondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB), extending from the 4.6-mile radius \nof the Hickory Regional Airport to 5.2 miles southwest of the NDB. \nAdditionally, this action proposes to amend the Class E5 airspace by \nextending the radius from 6.6-miles to 7.1 miles and adding an \nextension that is within 3-miles each side of the 055[deg] bearing from \nTawba NDB, extending from the 7.1-mile radius of the Hickory Regional \nAirport to 5.7 miles northeast of the NDB. The Class D and E2 airspace \narea is effective during the specific days and times established in \nadvance by a Notice to Airmen. The effective days and times will \nthereafter be continuously published in the Chart Supplement.\n    Lastly, this action proposes to amend Class E5 airspace at \nFoothills Regional Airport, Morganton, NC, by amending the confines, \nupdating the airport name and coordinates, and removing Grace Hospital \nfrom the description to be consistent with FAA's database. The action \nwill update the airport name from Morganton-Lenior Airport to Foothills \nRegional Airport and amend the Class E5 airspace extending upward from \n700 feet above the surface within a 8-mile radius of the Foothills \nRegional Airport and within 2 miles each side of the 205[deg] and \n023[deg] bearing from Fiddlers NDB, extending from the 8-mile radius to \n4.7-miles southwest and from the 8-mile radius to 18.2-miles northeast \nof the NDB; excluding that airspace within the Hickory, NC, Class E \nairspace area.\n\nRegulatory Notices and Analyses\n\n    The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves \nan established body of technical regulations for which frequent and \nroutine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. \nIt, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under \nExecutive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) Regulatory Policies and Procedures \n(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation \nof a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. \nSince this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic \nprocedures and air navigation, it is certified that this proposed rule, \nwhen promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities under the criteria of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nEnvironmental Review\n\n    This proposal will be subject to an environmental analysis in \naccordance with FAA Order 1050.1F, ``Environmental Impacts: Policies \nand Procedures,'' prior to any final regulatory action by the FAA.\n\nLists of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71\n\n    Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).\n\nThe Proposed Amendment\n\n    In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows:\n\nPART 71--DESIGNATION OF CLASS A, B, C, D, AND E AIRSPACE AREAS; AIR \nTRAFFIC SERVICE ROUTES; AND REPORTING POINTS\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 71 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 106(f), 106(g), 40103, 40113, 40120; E.O. \n10854, 24 FR 9565, 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 389.\n\n\nSec.  71.1  [Amended]\n\n0\n2. The incorporation by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 of FAA Order JO \n7400.11J, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated July 31, \n2024, and effective September 15, 2024, is amended as follows:\n\nParagraph 5000 Class D Airspace.\n\n* * * * *\n\nASO NC D Hickory, NC [Amended]\n\nHickory Regional Airport, NC\n    (Lat. 35[deg]44'28'' N, long. 81[deg]23'22'' W)\n\n    That airspace extending upward from the surface to and including \n3700 feet MSL within a 4.6-mile radius of Hickory Regional Airport \nand within 2 miles each side of the 235[deg] bearing of Tawba NDB, \nextending from a 4.6-mile radius of the Hickory Regional\n\n[[Page 21876]]\n\nAirport to 5.2 miles southwest of the NDB.

Statutory and Regulatory Provisions\n\n    The legislative framework generally referred to as the BSA consists \nof the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, as \namended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of \n2001 (USA PATRIOT Act),\\1\\ and other legislation, including the Anti-\nMoney Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act).\\2\\ The BSA is codified at 12 \nU.S.C. 1829b, 1951-1960 and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5314, 5316-5336, including \nnotes thereto, with implementing regulations at 31 CFR chapter X.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ Public Law 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (Oct. 26, 2001).\n    \\2\\ The AML Act was enacted as Division F, sections 6001-6511, \nof the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2021, Public Law 116-283, 134 Stat. 3388 (Jan. \n1, 2021).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The BSA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to, \ninter alia, require financial institutions to keep records and file \nreports that are determined to have a high degree of usefulness in \ncriminal, tax, or regulatory matters, risk assessments or proceedings, \nor in intelligence or counter-intelligence activities, including \nanalysis, to protect against terrorism, and to implement anti-money \nlaundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) programs and \ncompliance procedures.\\3\\ The Secretary has delegated to the Director \nof FinCEN (Director) the authority to administer the BSA.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ See 31 U.S.C. 5311(1)-(2).\n    \\4\\ Treasury Order 180-01 (Reaffirmed Jan. 14, 2020); see also \n31 U.S.C. 310(b)(2)(I) (providing that the Director of FinCEN shall \n``[a]dminister the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of \nthis title, chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91-508, and section \n21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to the extent delegated \nsuch authority by the Secretary.'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    31 U.S.C. 5318(j) prohibits a covered financial institution \\5\\ \nfrom maintaining correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on \nbehalf of, foreign banks that do not have a physical presence in any \ncountry. In addition, under 31 U.S.C. 5318(k), a covered financial \ninstitution maintaining a correspondent account in the United States \nfor a foreign bank, must retain records identifying: (i) the owners of \nrecord and the beneficial owners of the foreign bank, and (ii) the name \nand address of a person residing in the United States who is authorized \nto accept service of legal process for the foreign bank.\\6\\ The \nregulations implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(j) and 31 U.S.C. 5318(k) appear \nat 31 CFR 1010.630.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ A covered financial institution is any financial institution \ndescribed in subparagraphs (A) through (G) of 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(2), \nincluding an insured bank, as defined in section 3(h) of the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(h)); a commercial bank or \ntrust company; a private banker; an agency or branch of a foreign \nbank in the United States; any credit union; a thrift institution; \nand a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 \nU.S.C. 78a et seq.). 31 U.S.C. 5318(j)(1).\n    \\6\\ 31 U.S.C. 5318(k)(3)(A) and (B). The AML Act amended the \nprovision by including a reference to ``record and beneficial'' \nownership and by indicating, with respect to agents for service of \nprocess, that requests could involve records related to the \ncorrespondent account or accounts held at the foreign bank.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    31 CFR 1010.630(a)(1) prohibits a covered financial institution \\7\\ \nfrom establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing\n\n[[Page 21988]]\n\ncorrespondent accounts \\8\\ in the United States for, or on behalf of, \nforeign shell banks.\\9\\ A covered financial institution must take \nreasonable steps to ensure that any correspondent account established, \nmaintained, administered, or managed by that covered financial \ninstitution in the United States for a foreign bank is not being used \nby that foreign bank \\10\\ to indirectly provide banking services to a \nforeign shell bank.\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ A covered financial institution for purposes of 31 CFR \n1010.630 is: (i) an insured bank (as defined in section 3(h) of the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(h))); (ii) a \ncommercial bank or trust company; (iii) a private banker; (iv) an \nagency or branch of a foreign bank in the United States; (v) a \ncredit union; (vi) a savings association; (vii) a corporation acting \nunder section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 611 et \nseq.); and (viii) a broker or dealer in securities registered, or \nrequired to be registered, with the SEC under the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a, et seq.), except persons who \nregister pursuant to section 15(b)(11) of the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934. 31 CFR 1010.605(e)(2).\n    \\8\\ For purposes of 31 CFR 1010.630, a correspondent account is \ndefined as an account established for a foreign bank to receive \ndeposits from, or to make payments or other disbursements on behalf \nof, the foreign bank, or to handle other financial transactions \nrelated to such foreign bank. 31 CFR 1010.605(c)(1)(ii).\n    \\9\\ Foreign shell bank means a foreign bank without a physical \npresence in any country. 31 CFR 1010.605(g).\n    \\10\\ A foreign bank is defined as a bank organized under foreign \nlaw, or an agency, branch or office located outside the United \nStates of a bank. The term does not include an agent, agency, branch \nor office within the United States of a bank organized under foreign \nlaw. 31 CFR 1010.100(u).\n    \\11\\ Covered financial institutions are not prohibited from \nproviding correspondent accounts or banking services to foreign \nshell banks that qualify as ``regulated affiliates.'' 31 CFR \n1010.630(a)(1)(iii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    31 CFR 1010.630(a)(2) requires a covered financial institution that \nmaintains a correspondent account in the United States for a foreign \nbank to retain records in the United States identifying: (i) the owners \n\\12\\ of each such foreign bank whose shares are not publicly \ntraded,\\13\\ unless the foreign bank is required to file with the \nFederal Reserve Board a Form FR Y-7 that identifies the current owners \nof the foreign bank; \\14\\ and (ii) the name and street address of a \nperson who resides in the United States and is authorized, and has \nagreed to be an agent to accept service of legal process for records \nregarding each such account.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ ``Owner'' is defined at 31 CFR 1010.605(j) as any person \nwho, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, or has the power to \nvote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities or other \nvoting interests of a foreign bank, or controls in any manner the \nelection of a majority of the directors (or individuals exercising \nsimilar functions) of a foreign bank.\n    \\13\\ The phrase ``publicly traded'' refers to shares that are \ntraded on an exchange or on an organized over-the-counter market \nthat is regulated by a ``foreign securities authority'' as defined \nin section 3(a)(50) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 \nU.S.C. 78C(a)(50)). 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(2)(iii).\n    \\14\\ 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(2)(ii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    31 CFR 1010.630(b) states that a covered financial institution will \nbe deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of 31 CFR \n1010.630(a) with respect to a foreign bank if the covered financial \ninstitution obtains, at least once every three years, a certification \nor recertification from the foreign bank. FinCEN has developed an \noptional form \\15\\ that a covered financial institution may use in \nobtaining the certification or recertification.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\15\\ See ``Certification Regarding Correspondent Accounts for \nForeign Banks,'' OMB Control Number 1506-0043, available at <a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Certification%20Regarding%20Correspondent%20Accounts%20for%20Foreign%20Banks.pdf\">https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Certification%20Regarding%20Correspondent%20Accounts%20for%20Foreign%20Banks.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    31 CFR 1010.630(c) requires a covered financial institution to \nrequest that a foreign bank verify or correct the information provided \nin such foreign bank's certification or recertification, if the covered \nfinancial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that \nsuch information is incorrect or no longer accurate. Additionally, the \ncovered financial institution may take other appropriate measures to \nascertain the accuracy of the information or to obtain the correct \ninformation.\n    If a covered financial institution has not obtained a certification \nor recertification, or otherwise obtained documentation of information \nneeded for a certification or recertification, within 30 calendar days \nafter the date the account is established, and at least once every \nthree years thereafter, the covered financial institution must close \nall such foreign bank's correspondent accounts within a commercially \nreasonable time, and must restrict the foreign bank's ability to \nestablish any new position or execute any new transactions through any \nsuch account other than those transactions necessary to close the \naccount.\\16\\ If a covered financial institution conducting an interim \nverification pursuant to 31 CFR 1010.630(c) has not obtained \nverification of the information or corrected information within 90 \ncalendar days after the date of undertaking the interim verification, \nthe covered financial institution must follow the same account closure \nprocedures set out above.\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ 31 CFR 1010.630(d)(2).\n    \\17\\ 31 CFR 1010.630(d)(3).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    31 CFR 1010.630(d)(4) prohibits covered financial institutions \nfrom: (i) re-establishing any account closed pursuant to 31 CFR \n1010.630(d); and (ii) establishing any other correspondent account with \nthe foreign bank whose account was closed, unless the foreign bank \nprovides the appropriate certification or recertification.\n    31 CFR 1010.630(d)(5) states that a covered financial institution \nwill not be held liable to any person in any court or arbitration \nproceeding for terminating a correspondent account in accordance with \n31 CFR 1010.630(d).\n    31 CFR 1010.630(e) requires covered financial institutions to \nretain any original document provided by a foreign bank, and the \noriginal or a copy of any document otherwise relied upon by the covered \nfinancial institution for purposes of complying with 31 CFR 1010.630, \nfor at least five years after the date that a covered financial \ninstitution no longer maintains any correspondent account for such \nforeign bank, or longer if directed by the Secretary.\n\nII. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) <SUP>18</SUP>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ Public Law 104-13, 109 Stat. 163 (May 22, 1995), codified \nat 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Title: Prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell \nbanks; records concerning owners of foreign banks and agents for \nservice of legal process (31 CFR 1010.630).\n    OMB Control Number: 1506-0043.\n    Form Number: Optional form--certification regarding correspondent \naccounts for foreign banks.\\19\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ See supra note 13.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Abstract: FinCEN is issuing this notice to renew the OMB control \nnumber for regulations prohibiting a covered financial institution from \nmaintaining correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and \nrequiring a covered financial institution to maintain records \nidentifying the owners of certain foreign banks and agents residing in \nthe United States who have agreed to accept service of legal process \nfor records regarding correspondent accounts.\n    Affected Public: Businesses or other for-profit institutions, and \nnon-profit institutions.\n    Type of Review: Renewal without change of a currently approved \ninformation collection.\n    Frequency: As required.\n    Estimated Number of Potential Respondents: 12,637 covered financial \ninstitutions.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ Table 1 presents the distribution of financial \ninstitutions, by type, covered by this notice.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    A ``covered financial institution,'' as defined for purposes of 31 \nCFR 1010.630,\\21\\ is comprised of entities subject to the Anti-money \nlaundering (AML) program requirements for banks at 31 CFR 1020.210 plus \nthe entities subject to the Anti-money laundering program requirements \nfor brokers or dealers in securities at 31 CFR 1023.210.\\22\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ See supra notes 5 and 6.\n    \\22\\ See 31 CFR 1010.100(d). A wide variety of terms have been \nused at different times to describe various, sometimes overlapping \ncategories of legal entities chartered by federal, state, or \nterritorial authorities to take deposits and/or provide trust \ncompany services and comparable foreign entities licensed to engage \nin such business within the United States. This variety of terms and \nlack of sharp distinctions is a consequence of the complex legal \nhistory of banking in the United States, in which new regulatory \nschemes have often been added to existing legal frameworks, while \nacts of simplification and rationalization have been far less \ncommon. The BSA's original language on this subject reflected this \ncomplexity. See Section 203(e)(1)-(6) of the Currency and Foreign \nTransactions Reporting Act, Public Law 91-508 (Oct. 26, 1970), 84 \nStat. 1119. The initial implementing regulations for the BSA \nrationalized this subject by referring to all of these legal \nentities by the single label ``bank,'' defined in a comparatively \nstraightforward and comprehensive fashion. See Treasury Department, \nFinal Rule, Part 103--Financial Recordkeeping and Reporting of \nCurrency and Foreign Transactions, 37 FR 6912 (April 5, 1972). \nNeither statutory nor regulatory language on this subject has \nchanged significantly in the ensuing five decades. This has had the \npractical advantage that the regulatory footprint of FinCEN's bank-\nrelated regulations has been quite congruent from one regulation to \nanother. FinCEN acknowledges, however, that the occasional \nreiteration of old terminology has obscured this practical \nadvantage. FinCEN is taking the opportunity of the current notice to \naffirm that all FinCEN regulations that implement statutory \nobligations imposed on financial institutions described in 31 U.S.C. \n5312(a)(2)(A)-(F) can count covered entities for purposes of burden \ncalculation the way that FinCEN has developed to count the defined \ncategory ``banks.'' This is true even when regulations applicable to \nfinancial institutions described in 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(2)(A)-(F) use \na term other than ``bank'' such as ``covered financial \ninstitution.'' This congruence across regulations allows FinCEN to \nbe able to explain more clearly how it counts regulated entities and \ncalculates burden on a notice-by-notice basis, and to provide \ngreater transparency about its methods more consistently across \nnotices.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 21989]]\n\n    The AML program requirements for banks (31 CFR 1020.210) separate \nthe category of ``banks'' in two broad categories: banks regulated by a \nFederal functional regulator \\23\\ and banks lacking a Federal \nfunctional regulator.\\24\\ FinCEN's estimates of the potential \nrespondents covered by this notice rely on a methodology that \nidentifies banks by these groupings.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ 31 CFR 1020.210(a).\n    \\24\\ 31 CFR 1020.210(b).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The distribution of financial institutions, by type, covered by \nthis notice is reflected in table 1 below:\n\n Table 1--Distribution of Financial Institutions Covered by This Notice\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   Type of institution                         Count\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBanks with a Federal functional regulator (FFR).........       8,922 \\a\\\nBanks lacking an FFR....................................         399 \\b\\\nBrokers or dealers in securities (broker-dealers).......       3,316 \\c\\\n                                                         ---------------\n    Total...............................................          12,637\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\a\\ This includes 4,467 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-\n  insured depository institutions (including national banks, state banks\n  that are members of the Federal Reserve System, state-chartered non-\n  member banks, and insured U.S. branches of foreign banks, i.e., all\n  federally regulated banks) according to the FDIC's quarterly data\n  summary for Q1 2025, and 4,455 National Credit Union Administration\n  (NCUA)-insured credit unions (including federal credit unions and\n  state-chartered credit unions with NCUA insurance, i.e., all federally\n  regulated credit unions) according to NCUA's quarterly credit union\n  data summary for Q1 2025.\n\\b\\ The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Master Account\n  and Services Database contains data on financial institutions that\n  utilize Reserve Bank financial services, including those with no\n  federal regulator. FinCEN used this data to identify 399 banks and\n  credit unions utilizing Reserve Bank financial services with no\n  federal regulator.\n\\c\\ The SEC data on active broker-dealers (Company Information About\n  Active Broker-Dealers) contains 3,316 active broker-dealers who are\n  registered with the SEC.\n\n    Estimated Number of Expected Respondents: 104 covered financial \ninstitutions that maintain correspondent accounts with foreign \nbanks.\\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ Table 2 provides FinCEN's estimate of the number of banks \nand broker-dealers that maintain correspondent accounts for foreign \nbanks.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    While the regulations apply to banks and broker-dealers, in \npractice the recordkeeping costs would only accrue to the banks and \nbroker-dealers that maintain correspondent accounts for foreign banks. \nTable 2 presents an estimate of this subpopulation of banks and broker-\ndealers based on public data from the most recent available calendar \nyear end. The methodology used to estimate the population in table 2, \nas a proper subset of the total potentially affected population, is \nconsistent with the approach FinCEN utilized in its recent renewal of \nOMB control number 1506-0066 (CISADA) \\26\\ and its recent proposal to \nimpose 311 special measures with respect to Huione Group,\\27\\ but has \nbeen updated to incorporate newly available data on affected entities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\26\\ See FinCEN, Agency Information Collection Activities; \nProposed Renewal; Comment Request; Renewal Without Change of \nReporting Obligations on Foreign Bank Relationships With Iranian-\nLinked Financial Institutions Designated Under IEEPA and IRGC-Linked \nPersons Designated Under IEEPA, 90 FR 14183 (Mar. 28, 2025).\n    \\27\\ See, FinCEN, Proposal of Special Measure regarding Huione \nGroup, as a Foreign Financial Institution of Primary Money \nLaundering Concern, 90 FR 18934 (May 5, 2025).\n\n Table 2--Distribution of Financial Institutions, by Type, Estimated To\n            Maintain Correspondent Accounts for Foreign Banks\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             Number of\n              Type of financial institution                  financial\n                                                           institutions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBanks with an FFR.......................................          61 \\a\\\nBanks lacking an FFR....................................          17 \\b\\\nBroker-dealers..........................................          26 \\c\\\n                                                         ---------------\n    Total...............................................             104\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\a\\ Data are from the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council\n  Central Data Repository for Reports of Condition and Income (Call\n  Reports) and Uniform Bank Performance Reports (UBPRs), available for\n  most FDIC-insured institutions. Using this source of data, FinCEN\n  determines that as of Q4 2024, approximately 61 banking organizations\n  (national and state banks, trusts, thrifts and savings and loans,\n  branches and agencies of foreign banking organizations, representative\n  offices, Edge Act corporations, and agreement corporations) will be\n  affected by this rule on any given year. Specifically, we determine\n  that there are approximately 61 entities (U.S. banks; national and\n  state-chartered banks, trusts, savings and loans, thrifts; branches\n  and agencies of foreign banks; Edge Act corporations; and agreement\n  corporations) that report values for deposit liabilities of banks in\n  foreign countries. Non-zero deposit liabilities in a foreign country\n  are treated as indicia that a bank maintains a correspondent account\n  for at least one foreign financial institution. Credit unions, due to\n  chartering restrictions, do not typically maintain foreign\n  correspondent accounts.\n\\b\\ The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Master Account\n  and Services Database contains data on financial institutions that\n  utilize Reserve Bank financial services, including those with no\n  federal regulator. FinCEN used this data to identify an additional 17\n  international banking entities with no federal regulator and who do\n  not file Call Reports, but who are also likely to maintain\n  correspondent accounts with a foreign financial institution.\n\\c\\ Broker-dealers, unless they are publicly traded, are not required to\n  make reports indicating whether they have foreign correspondent\n  accounts or hold foreign deposits. FinCEN reviewed 10-Q (SEC quarterly\n  filing for US publicly traded firms) and 6-K (SEC filing for foreign\n  private issuers of securities) and identified nine publicly-traded\n  broker-dealers with U.S. operations that reported foreign deposits.\n  However, because many broker-dealers are not publicly traded, FinCEN\n  conservatively estimates that the proportion of broker-dealers with\n  foreign correspondent accounts will be similar to the proportion for\n  banks (approximately 0.8%). 0.8% of 3,316 active broker-dealers is\n  approximately 26 broker-dealers assumed to have foreign correspondent\n  accounts.\n\nEstimated Recordkeeping Burden: <SUP>28</SUP>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ In addition to requirements in 31 CFR 1010.630, a covered \nfinancial institution is subject to, among other requirements, AML/\nCFT program and due diligence requirements in 31 CFR 1010.610. The \nburden for a covered financial institution to comply with 31 CFR \n1010.610 is included in OMB control number 1506-0046. OMB control \nnumber 1506-0046 was renewed in 2024, following a notice and request \nfor comment published in the Federal Register. See FinCEN, Agency \nInformation Collection Activities; Proposed Renewal; Comment \nRequest; Renewal Without Change of Due Diligence Programs for \nCorrespondent Accounts for Foreign Financial Institutions and for \nPrivate Banking Accounts, 89 FR 49273 (June 11, 2024). In the \nnotice, FinCEN assigned an expected average recordkeeping burden of \ntwo hours per covered financial institution per year associated with \nthe requirements in 31 CFR 1010.610. The burden estimates covered in \nthis notice are meant to complement that burden estimate and should \nbe considered an incremental assessment of the additional time and \nother costs related to recordkeeping as required by 31 CFR 1010.630 \nthat are not otherwise accounted for under other OMB control numbers \npertaining to the same (or similar) activities, including OMB \ncontrol number 1506-0046.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    FinCEN is implementing methodological changes in its approach\n\n[[Page 21990]]\n\nto recordkeeping burden estimates in this renewal as part of certain, \nbroader programmatic efforts to better align and harmonize PRA burden \nestimates across the OMB control numbers that pertain to a covered \nfinancial institution's BSA-related activities and AML/CFT program \nobligations. These changes are being undertaken with a view to both \nimproving the accuracy and precision of the estimates in each \nindividual renewal and enhancing the tractability of each component \nanalysis within the context of FinCEN's full portfolio of active OMB \ncontrol numbers.\n    In recent related renewals,\\29\\ including the most recent prior \nrenewal of 1506-0043,\\30\\ FinCEN has noted certain practical challenges \nto determining the total number of covered financial institutions that \nmaintain correspondent accounts for foreign banks, as well as \nchallenges to estimating the total number of correspondent accounts for \nforeign banks that each of those covered financial institutions \nmaintains. In the 2022 renewal notice related to these regulations, \nFinCEN previewed its intention to consider further harmonization and \npotential integration of PRA burden estimates across regulatory \nsections pertaining to due diligence requirements unique to the \nmaintenance of foreign correspondent accounts.\\31\\ In addition, FinCEN \nhas noted a paucity of publicly available data from which to derive \nestimates of the number of covered financial institutions that have an \nobligation under the regulation to obtain certification or \nrecertification forms from foreign banks in any given year, how many of \neach type of certification is required in any given year, how often \ncovered financial institutions need to conduct interim verifications \nfor foreign banks for which they suspect the current information is no \nlonger correct, and how frequently covered financial institutions need \nto determine if correspondent account closure is necessary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ See FinCEN, Agency Information Collection Activities; \nProposed Renewal: Comment Request; Renewal Without Change of Due \nDiligence Programs for Correspondent Accounts for Foreign Financial \nInstitutions and for Private Banking Accounts, 89 FR 49273 (June 11, \n2024) for the most recent renewal of OMB control number 1506-0046. \nSee FinCEN, Agency Information Collection Activities; Proposed \nRenewal; Comment Request; Renewal Without Change of Recordkeeping \nand Termination of Correspondent Accounts for Foreign Banks, 83 FR \n42555 (Aug. 22, 2018) (the 2018 Shell Bank PRA Renewal) and FinCEN, \nAgency Information Collection Activities; Proposed Renewal; Comment \nRequest; Renewal Without Change of Prohibition on Correspondent \nAccounts for Foreign Shell Banks; Records Concerning Owners of \nForeign Banks and Agents for Service of Legal Process, 87 FR 7919 \n(Feb. 10, 2022) (the 2022 Shell Bank PRA Renewal) for the last two \nrenewals of OMB control number 1506-0043.\n    \\30\\ See supra note 27. 2022 Shell Bank PRA Renewal.\n    \\31\\ ``FinCEN assesses that the provisions of 31 CFR 1010.630 \nare in large part conducted in connection with the due diligence and \nenhanced due diligence covered financial institutions conduct on \nforeign correspondent accounts as required by 31 CFR 1010.610. In \nfuture supplemental annual PRA burden estimates for 31 CFR 1010.610 \nand 31 CFR 1010.630, FinCEN will consider whether the burden \nestimates for these two regulatory requirements should be linked and \nestimated together.'' Id. at Section II.2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    To minimize these practical challenges, FinCEN has applied a \ndifferent approach in one of its recent renewal notices.\\32\\ While \nincreasing its estimates of the number of expected respondents, FinCEN \nconcurrently has reduced its estimates of: (1) the implied number of \nforeign banks with correspondent accounts; and (2) the time burden of \ncompliance with 31 CFR 1010.630 per foreign correspondent account.\\33\\ \nNoting ``that some covered financial institutions may only maintain a \nfew correspondent accounts for foreign banks, while other covered \nfinancial institutions may maintain multiple correspondent accounts for \nforeign banks,'' \\34\\ FinCEN has projected that each covered financial \ninstitution would conduct one initial certification and one \nrecertification each year and assigned a corresponding total average \nannual burden of 30 hours per covered financial institution.\\35\\ For \neach activity, respectively, the estimated (re)certification burden is \nintended to include time spent to obtain or update assurances from the \nforeign bank that it does not provide banking services, directly or \nindirectly, to a foreign shell bank; ownership information from the \nforeign bank, if necessary; and the name and address of an agent for \nservice of legal process for the foreign bank residing in the United \nStates. FinCEN also includes the time to review all documentation \nsubmitted by the foreign bank, and the time to maintain records of all \ndocumentation associated with the (re)certification process for the \nforeign bank. FinCEN's estimates have contemplated a covered financial \ninstitution obtaining the requisite (re)certification information via \nthe provision of FinCEN's optional certification form to the foreign \nbank for which it maintained a correspondent account, which the foreign \nbank would then complete and return to the covered financial \ninstitution.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ Id.; see supra note 27.\n    \\33\\ When FinCEN renewed OMB control number 1506-0043 in 2022, \nit estimated that there were 8,696 covered financial institutions \nwith one or more correspondent accounts for foreign banks. See the \n2022 Shell Bank PRA Renewal. In the preceding renewal, it estimated \nthat there were 2,000 coved financial institutions with \ncorrespondent accounts for 9,000 foreign banks. See the 2018 Shell \nBank PRA Renewal. In 2018, the PRA total burden estimate included an \nannual estimate of the following three items per covered financial \ninstitution: (i) 20 hours to complete a certification for a foreign \nbank; (ii) five hours to complete a recertification for a foreign \nbank; and (iii) nine hours to maintain records on the foreign bank's \ncertification/recertification.\n    \\34\\ Id.\n    \\35\\ See supra note 27. In the 2022 renewal of OMB control \nnumber 1506-0043, FinCEN revised its estimate to incorporate the \nrecordkeeping component of the burden estimate within the \ncertification and recertification process. FinCEN also revised its \nassessment of the time necessary to conduct a recertification, as \nthe process is identical to a certification. For those reasons, \nFinCEN estimated the burden for a certification and corresponding \nrecordkeeping was 15 hours; and the burden for a recertification and \ncorresponding recordkeeping was also 15 hours.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    FinCEN now estimates the PRA burden of 31 CFR 1010.630 would \ncomprise the following: 20 hours to complete a certification for a \nforeign bank, five hours to complete a recertification for a foreign \nbank, and nine hours to maintain records on the foreign bank's \n(re)certification. At the time of the original estimates, the initial \n20 hours for a new certification was intended to include ``the time for \nreviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and \nmaintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the \ncollection of information.'' \\36\\ Because FinCEN maintains more than \none active OMB control number that would potentially cover these \nactivities (reviewing instructions, searching, gathering, and \nmaintaining requisite data, and reviewing relevant information) it is \npossible that prior burden assignments have overestimated the \nincremental PRA costs of the regulatory requirements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\36\\ See supra note 13.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In this notice, FinCEN is attempting to harmonize the burden hours \nimplied by the aggregate estimates contained in the\n\n[[Page 21991]]\n\n2024 renewal of OMB control number 1506-0046, which did not make a \ndistinction between entities that are potentially affected and those \nthat are expected to incur costs, with the burden estimates here that \ndo.\\37\\ Accounting for these differences and retroactively applying \ncertain simplifying assumptions,\\38\\ the covered financial entities \nsubject to, and expected to be affected by, 31 CFR 1010.630 would \nalready be estimated to incur a burden of approximately 150 hours per \nyear, on average,\\39\\ in connection with due diligence activities over \nforeign correspondent accounts under 31 CFR 1010.610 as accounted for \nin the 2024 renewal of 1506-0046.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\37\\ FinCEN intends to employ this methodological refinement \nacross all relevant OMB control numbers going forward.\n    \\38\\ For purposes of tractability in comparison to OMB control \nnumber 1506-0046, FinCEN assigns a 15-minute (0.25 hour) \nrecordkeeping burden to entities that maintain neither foreign \ncorrespondent accounts nor private banking accounts. FinCEN then \nimposes a simplifying assumption that the residual recordkeeping \nburden to affected entities is twice as high for entities that \nmaintain both foreign correspondent accounts and private banking \naccounts than entities that provide only one service or the other. \nThe population of entities that offer private banking accounts is \nestimated using a size threshold of $10 billion in total \nconsolidated assets.\n    \\39\\ Based on estimates derived from available bank data for \ncalendar years 2023 and 2024 that averaged across and between \ncohorts that were expected to maintain both foreign correspondent \nand private banking accounts and those expected to maintain foreign \ncorrespondent accounts only.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In the itemization below, FinCEN reviews the primary \ncharacteristics of the regulatory requirements and explains its \nintended revised assignment of annual PRA burden hours to those \nrequirements.\n    (a) 31 CFR 1010.630 (a):\n    31 CFR 1010.630(a) sets forth certain requirements for covered \nfinancial institutions with respect to correspondent accounts \nmaintained for foreign banks. FinCEN's estimate of incremental burden \nper element of 31 CFR 1010.630(a) is discussed below.\n    (a)(1): While 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(1) does not prohibit a covered \nfinancial institution from providing a correspondent account or other \nbanking services to a regulated affiliate,\\40\\ it does prohibit a \ncovered financial institution from establishing, maintaining, \nadministering, or managing an account in the United States for, or on \nbehalf of, a foreign shell bank.\\41\\ It also requires a covered \nfinancial institution to take reasonable steps to ensure that the \naccounts they establish, maintain, administer or manage for a foreign \nbank are not used to provide services to foreign shell banks \nindirectly.\\42\\ FinCEN is reducing the time burden of the recordkeeping \nrequirements of (a)(1) to one hour per foreign correspondent account \nper year in the estimates in this renewal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\40\\ 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(1)(iii).\n    \\41\\ 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(1)(i).\n    \\42\\ 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(1)(ii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    FinCEN has two reasons for this reduction. First, the absence of an \nactivity (in this case, not establishing, maintaining, administering, \nor managing an account for a foreign shell bank), and obtaining \nevidence or assurances of that absence, is unlikely to generate \nsignificant or lengthy documentation.\\43\\ Separately, while a covered \nfinancial institution is likely to document the reasonable steps it \nundertook to ensure that the foreign banks it serves are not shell \nbanks themselves, and are not in turn providing services to foreign \nshell banks, these steps and their related recordkeeping burden would \nalready be accounted for under either the recordkeeping burden of OMB \ncontrol number 1506-0046 (which covers 31 CFR 1010.610) or the \nactivities undertaken in connection with other components of 31 CFR \n1010.630, particularly 1010.630(c), (d), and (e), since obtaining and \nverifying information,\\44\\ retaining records of that information,\\45\\ \nand closing accounts when the requisite information cannot be obtained \nor verified \\46\\ are all reasonable steps to take to ensure that \nforeign shell banks are not obtaining services indirectly. This \nassignment is generally consistent with the allocation of burden in the \nmost recent prior renewal notice.\\47\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\43\\ For example, in Section C, if using the optional \ncertification form provided by FinCEN (see supra note 13), a foreign \nbank may either self-identify as a shell bank by selecting a box or, \nby selecting one of two other boxes and completing three information \nfields, certify that is not a shell bank. Similarly, Section D of \nthe optional certification form allows the foreign bank to certify \nthat it does not indirectly provide services to any foreign shell \nbank by checking a box.\n    \\44\\ 31 CFR 1010.630(c).\n    \\45\\ 31 CFR 1010.630(e).\n    \\46\\ 31 CFR 1010.630(d).\n    \\47\\ ``FinCEN believes that the due diligence being conducted to \ncomply with 31 CFR 1010.610(a) would be coordinated with the \nidentification of foreign banks that have not provided the required \ncertification, recertification, or interim verification within the \nrequired timeframes, resulting in the closure of correspondent \naccounts with such foreign banks consistent with 31 CFR \n1010.610(d).'' 87 FR 7294 (Feb. 10, 2022).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    (a)(2)(i): 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(2)(i) requires a covered financial \ninstitution to maintain, in the United States, for each foreign bank \nfor which the covered financial institution maintains a correspondent \naccount: (1) records that identify the owners of the foreign bank \\48\\ \nand (2) the name and address of an authorized agent who agrees to \naccept service of legal process for records and who resides in the \nUnited States. (There is a partial exception to the requirement to \nmaintain ownership records: a covered financial institution does not \nhave to maintain such records on foreign banks that have filed Form FR \nY-7 with the Federal Reserve or that are publicly traded as defined in \n31 CFR 1010.630(a)(2)(iii).) FinCEN is assigning zero hours of \nincremental burden to the requirements of this subsection because \nmaintaining records of ownership and agent for service of legal process \ninformation are a proper subset of the recordkeeping activities \nrequired by 31 CFR 1010.630(e) and would otherwise be doubly counted if \nassigned recordkeeping burden hours as part of 31 CFR 1010.630(a) as \nwell.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\48\\ As defined in 31 CFR 1010.605(j).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    (a)(2)(ii) and (iii): FinCEN is also assigning zero burden hours to \nthe remaining subsections of 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(2), as both 31 CFR \n1010.630(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) define subpopulations of foreign banks for \nwhich a covered financial institution is not required to maintain \nownership records. Exempting foreign banks that have a form FR Y-7 on \nfile with the Federal Reserve Board (in 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(2)(ii)) and \ndefining the scope of exempted banks whose shares are publicly traded \nto cover all foreign banks with shares traded on a market regulated by \na foreign securities authority \\49\\ (in 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(2)(iii)) are \nboth expected to reduce paperwork and respondent burden. In part, the \nexemptions reduce burden by minimizing the duplication of effort in \ncollecting information that is already reported to another authority or \nagency (and would thereby be available for investigative and \nenforcement purposes, as needed). Additionally, the exemptions remove \nwhat would otherwise be a redundant recordkeeping burden on covered \nfinancial institutions with respect to records that a regulatory agency \nor authority already maintains.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\49\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(50).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    (b) 31 CFR 1010.630 (b):\n    31 CFR 1010.630(b) establishes a safe harbor such that, provided a \ncovered financial institution continues to meet its concurrent \nobligations under 31 CFR 1010.630(c) and (d), the financial institution \nneed not obtain (re)certification of the foreign banks for whom it \nmaintains correspondent accounts more than once per three years to \nsatisfy its obligations under 31 CFR 1010.630(a). FinCEN notes that, to \nthe extent that more frequent\n\n[[Page 21992]]\n\n(re)certification is not otherwise required for business or other \ncompliance purposes, the safe harbor is expected to reduce paperwork \nand respondent burden. Additionally, the records or documentation \nnecessary to establish that the conditions of the safe harbor have been \nmet should already be generated by the activities undertaken, thus the \nsafe harbor would not independently create an incremental necessity to \ncreate and maintain records. For these reasons FinCEN has not assigned \nany hours of recordkeeping burden to 31 CFR 1010.630(b).\n    (c) 31 CFR 1010.630 (c):\n    31 CFR 1010.630(c) clarifies that a covered financial institution \nwould need to request verification or correction of any information in \na (re)certification from its foreign correspondent bank if the covered \nfinancial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that \ninformation it previously received from the foreign bank or otherwise \nrelied upon to satisfy its original obligations under 31 CFR \n1010.630(a) is no longer correct. The covered financial institution may \nbe required to take other appropriate measures to ascertain the \naccuracy of the information in question or obtain correct information. \nAt this time FinCEN is not in possession of data or other information \nthat would enable it to estimate the frequency with which a covered \nfinancial institution must engage in interim verification on a per \naccount basis for its foreign correspondent accounts, but preliminarily \ndoes not expect the necessity to be pervasive or recurring because it \nwould be generally inconsistent with a financial institution's business \ninterests to routinely engage with clients from whom and about whom it \ncannot maintain reliable and accurate information. FinCEN further \nexpects that a substantial portion of the activities undertaken, and \nthe artifacts memorializing those activities, to ascertain and maintain \nthe accuracy of the information required under 31 CFR 1010.630(a) would \nnot be readily distinguishable from other due diligence activities such \nas those generally conducted in the course of business, required as \npart of AML programs generally, and covered under 31 CFR 1010.610, \nspecifically. FinCEN is therefore not assigning an incremental \nrecordkeeping burden to this component under this OMB control number as \npart of the current renewal but has included additional requests for \ncomment below that would help it assess the continued appropriateness \nof this approach.\\50\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\50\\ See Additional Requests for Comment below, specifically, \nquestions two and three.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    (d) 31 CFR 1010.630 (d):\n    31 CFR 1010.630(d) sets forth the requirements for account closure \nin the absence of necessary and timely (re)certification and other \nrequisite verifications of information, as needed. FinCEN's estimate of \nincremental burden per element of 31 CFR 1010.630(d) is discussed \nbelow.\n    (d)(1): At the time of the initial regulatory adoption of the \nrequirements covered by this OMB control number, 31 CFR 1010.610(d)(1) \nprovides an accommodation with respect to foreign correspondent \naccounts already in existence as of October 28, 2002, granting covered \nfinancial institutions 154 calendar days (102 business days) to bring \nsuch existing accounts into compliance with the requirements that \naccounts established after October 28, 2002 would have only 30 calendar \ndays to comply with.\n    While this accommodation of additional time reflects FinCEN's past \nefforts to balance a desire to reduce regulatory compliance burdens \nwith time-sensitive needs to implement policies in the interest of \nnational security, 31 CFR 1010.610(d)(1) is no longer expected to \nmeaningfully reduce burden because the accounts to which it applies \nhave now had the same requirements with respect to timely production of \ninformation and/or (re)certification as newer accounts for over 22 \nyears.\n    (d)(2): 31 CFR 1010.630(d)(2) concerns obtaining the \n(re)certification or required information needed to prevent a foreign \nbank's correspondent account closure. As discussed in Section I, \nforeign correspondent accounts established after October 28, 2002, must \nbe closed within a commercially reasonable time and may not be used to \nestablish new positions or execute transactions other than those \ntransactions necessary to close the account if (re)certification or the \ninformation necessary for (re)certification cannot be obtained within \n30 days of the original establishment of the account and at least once \nevery three years thereafter. As such, the requirement to obtain \ninformation and/or (re)certification with respect to foreign \ncorrespondent accounts under 31 CFR 1010.630 flows, indirectly, from \nthe regulatory obligation to close any foreign correspondent account \nfor which the requisite (re)certification and other information can \neither not be obtained timely or generally.\n    FinCEN is assigning a recordkeeping time burden of two hours \nassociated with the activities necessary to obtain the \n(re)certification or required information needed to prevent a foreign \nbank's correspondent account closure. This burden estimate, as a \nreduction from prior renewals, reflects certain considerations for how \nFinCEN anticipates compliance to be operationalized, including what \nactivities it considers incremental to other due diligence obligations, \nwho undertakes the activity unique to 31 CFR 1010.630, as well as what, \nand to what extent, related records are incremental to other \nrecordkeeping activities.\n    Because it has provided an optional certification form that a \ncovered financial institution could employ to satisfy its obligations \nunder 31 CFR 1010.630, FinCEN assumes that a covered financial \ninstitution would only elect to employ other means to meet its \nregulatory requirements if the institution considered its alternative \napproach to more appropriately or efficiently balance the costs and \nbenefits of its activities. FinCEN further expects that a covered \nfinancial institution would not bear the primary burden of producing \nthe information or completing the optional FinCEN (re)certification \nbecause it is expected to be completed by the foreign bank for whom the \ncovered financial institution maintains its correspondent account. The \npaperwork burden that accrues to the foreign bank in connection with 31 \nCFR 1010.630 is not included in the estimates of this OMB control \nrenewal. In part, this is because FinCEN does not have: (1) the data \nnecessary to articulate the distribution of foreign banks who would \ncomplete a (re)certification or otherwise provide the required \ninformation to its U.S. covered financial institution, (2) information \non what types of labor the foreign bank employs to perform is reporting \nactivities, and (3) information on what the prevailing market rates are \nfor those employees' labor in the currencies in which they are \ncompensated or their corresponding U.S. dollar equivalents. \nAdditionally, it is unclear whether assessing a magnitude of \nincremental burden to the foreign bank beyond a de minimis threshold is \nappropriate. A foreign bank is, in the course of its ordinary business, \nusually aware of its ownership, its U.S. agent for service of process, \nand the characteristics of its clients that would need to be disclosed \nin the optional (re)certification form it receives from the covered \nfinancial institution that\n\n[[Page 21993]]\n\nmaintains its correspondent account and would therefore not be forced \nto undertake extensive incremental effort to provide this information \nupon request. FinCEN is requesting comment on the reasonableness of \nthis approach as well as any data or anecdotal information that would \neither support its approach or any alternative approach proposed as an \nimprovement.\\51\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\51\\ See Additional Requests for Comment below, specifically, \nquestions seven and eight.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    (d)(3): 31 CFR 1010.630(d)(3) requires a covered financial \ninstitution to close all correspondent accounts with any foreign bank \nthat fails to provide verification or corrected information within 90 \ndays of when the covered financial institution first undertook its \ninquiry. Once a foreign correspondent account is closed due to an \ninability to timely obtain verification or revised information from the \nforeign bank, a covered financial institution is not permitted to \nreestablish the account or establish any new accounts with the foreign \nbank. FinCEN is not assigning an incremental recordkeeping burden to \ncompliance with 31 CFR 1010.630(d)(3) because the records generated by \nclosing an existing account and/or not opening any new accounts when a \nforeign bank does not provide verification or corrected information are \nexpected to be included in the records documenting a covered financial \ninstitution's other extended due diligence activities.\n    (d)(4): 31 CFR 1010.630(d)(4) concerns reestablishment of accounts. \nOnce a foreign correspondent account is closed due to an inability to \ntimely obtain (re)certification or the information necessary for \n(re)certification, a covered financial institution is not permitted to \nreestablish the account or establish any new accounts with the foreign \nbank until the covered financial institution receives the foreign \nbank's requisite (re)certification. FinCEN does not, at this time, have \ndata or other information that would enable it to separately estimate \nthe number of (re)certifications pursued or obtained by covered \nfinancial institutions per year in connection with (re)establishing \naccounts otherwise prohibited by 31 CFR 1010.630(d)(4).\\52\\ \nNevertheless, FinCEN's estimate of approximately 177 \n(re)certifications, on average, conducted by a given covered financial \ninstitution per year is intended to include these (re)certifications. \nThe associated burden per (re)certification is expected to be four \nhours, on average.\\53\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\52\\ See Additional Requests for Comment below, specifically, \nquestion 12.\n    \\53\\ Four hours per covered financial institution to obtain a \n(re)certification is the summation of one hour to comply with 31 CFR \n1010.630(a)(1); two hours to comply with 31 CFR 1010.630(d)(2) or \n(d)(4); and one hour to comply with 31 CFR 1010.630(e).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    (d)(5): 31 CFR 1010.630(d)(5), as discussed above in Section I, \nlimits the liability of a covered financial institution in the event \nthat the termination of a correspondent account executed in compliance \nwith 1010.630(d) results in a court or arbitration proceeding. Because \nthe threat of liability, generally, introduces a degree of additional \nuncertainty, it may, in some cases lead to overinvestment in activities \nsolely taken in a defensive posture; at the same time, it can create \nincentives to permit activities that would otherwise not occur because \nthe expected private costs to litigation (or arbitration) would accrue \nto the covered financial institution while the public harm from \nforgoing such costs would be externalized. To the extent that \nadditional activities and documentation would otherwise have been \nundertaken prophylactically, this provision is expected to reduce \npaperwork and the compliance burden associated with 31 CFR 1010.630 \ngenerally. Concurrently, the provision is expected to reduce costs to \nthe public by better aligning the private incentives of a covered \nfinancial institution with the level of account closures that is in the \npublic interest. FinCEN assigns zero incremental recordkeeping burden \nto this component of the renewal.\n    (e) 31 CFR 1010.630(e):\n    31 CFR 1010.630(e) requires a covered financial institution to \nretain the records necessary to demonstrate compliance with 31 CFR \n1010.630 for no fewer than five years after the closing of a foreign \ncorrespondent account, or longer if directed by the Secretary. The \nrecords to be maintained include both any original documents provided \nto a covered financial institution by a foreign bank, and either the \noriginal or a copy of any other document the covered financial \ninstitution relies upon to satisfy its regulatory requirements. FinCEN \nis assigning one burden hour per foreign correspondent account for \nwhich (re)certification is undertaken in a given year.\n    FinCEN is mindful that in some cases, covered financial \ninstitutions may incur certain technology costs related to the \nrequesting, processing, and secure storage of account-related data and \ninformation unique to FinCEN requirements. FinCEN is therefore \nsoliciting comments on the appropriateness of assigning a technology \ncost to these requirements and invites the public to provide data \nrelated to the incremental annual costs incurred by an affected covered \nfinancial institution associated with this retention of records.\n    (f) 31 CFR 1010.630 (f)(1)-(3):\n    31 CFR 1010.630(f) presents special rules to facilitate a covered \nfinancial institution's compliance with requirements to obtain \ninformation and (re)certifications, and retain records (in 31 CFR \n1010.630(f)(3)), subject to the applicable interim guidance (in 31 CFR \n1010.630(f)(1)) regarding information requested before October 28, 2002 \nand received on or before December 26, 2002 (in 31 CFR 1010.630(f)(2)). \nAs FinCEN does not expect any current or future recordkeeping burden to \naccrue in connection with information requested and/or received more \nthan 20 years ago, it is assigning a zero-burden hour estimate to this \ncomponent.\n    In sum, and in comparison to previous renewals, the scope of the \nannual PRA burden and cost estimates in this renewal is limited to \nrecordkeeping associated with the following activities: (1) obtaining \ncertification forms and recertification forms; and (2) maintaining \nrecords of the forms and any supporting documentation provided by \nforeign banks or otherwise obtained by the covered financial \ninstitution.\n    The annual hourly burden per affected covered financial institution \nfor each foreign bank for which it maintains a correspondent account is \nfour hours. This estimate covers the burden to a covered financial \ninstitution to:\n    <bullet> obtain assurances from the foreign bank that it is not \nproviding banking services, directly or indirectly, to a foreign shell \nbank (one hour, 1010.630(a)(1));\n    <bullet> obtain and review ownership information from the foreign \nbank, if necessary, including the name of an agent based in the United \nStates who has agreed to accept service of legal process for records \nregarding such correspondent account (two hours, 1010.630(d)(2) or \n(d)(4)); and\n    <bullet> maintain records of all documentation associated with the \ncertification process for the foreign bank (one hour, 1010.630(e)).\n    FinCEN estimates the annual hourly burden for a covered financial \ninstitution to obtain and maintain a recertification form from a \nforeign bank for which it maintains a correspondent account is also \nfour hours. FinCEN believes the hourly burden estimate for a \nrecertification is the same as for a certification because the covered \nfinancial institution can use the same certification form to reconfirm \nall of the\n\n[[Page 21994]]\n\ninformation required in the initial certification.\n    As noted above, a covered financial institution is required to \nobtain an initial certification and a recertification once every \nsubsequent three years from each foreign bank for which it maintains a \ncorrespondent account. FinCEN estimates that there are approximately \n104 covered financial institutions that maintain at least one \ncorrespondent account for a foreign bank. FinCEN is using this number \nto approximate the aggregate number of certifications and \nrecertifications expected affected covered financial institutions need \nto conduct annually.\n    To estimate the average number of expected (re)certifications per \naffected covered financial institution per year, FinCEN has consulted \npublicly available sources of data on the number of active foreign \ncorrespondent accounts in a given year. Select data in a report from \nthe Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) Committee on Payments and \nMarket Infrastructures (CPMI) suggests that there are hundreds of \nthousands of correspondent banking relationships globally, though the \nnumber has steadily declined over time. \\54\\ As measured by SWIFT \nmessaging flows, by the end of the most recent year for which data is \navailable (2022), approximately 90,000 bank pairs worldwide appear \nactive in a given month.\\55\\ Additional data from the BIS indicates \nthat, for countries in North America, the average number of direct \ncounterparty countries was 89.2 in 2022, representing a 12.9 percent \ndecrease over the period 2011-2022.\\56\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\54\\ See BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures: \nCorrespondent Banking, 16 (Graph 3a) July 2016, <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d147.pdf\">https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d147.pdf</a>; see also Rice, Tara and von Peter, Goetz and \nBoar, Codruta, On the Global Retreat of Correspondent Banks (March \n1, 2020).

While \nspecific data on the number of foreign correspondent accounts per U.S. \ncovered financial institution is not publicly available, a recent study \nby the European Central Bank found that among the fifteen banks \nsurveyed (all of which were large banks that maintained the highest \nconcentration of foreign correspondent accounts in Europe) the average \nnumber of foreign banks for which surveyed the banks maintained \naccounts in 2019 was approximately 500.\\58\\ Because the maintenance of \nforeign correspondent accounts decreased by a larger amount in both \nNorthern and Southern Europe over the BIS period of study (2011-2022, \nwhich includes the year of the ECB report (2019)), but for the full \nperiod both regions maintained higher average numbers of direct \ncounterparty countries than North America,\\59\\ FinCEN conservatively \nestimates that for purposes of its PRA estimates each covered bank or \nbroker-dealer with foreign correspondent accounts will maintain at \nleast the same number (500) of correspondent banking relationships for \nforeign banks, on average, over a three year horizon and is requesting \ncomment on this approach.\\60\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\57\\ See supra note 50.\n    \\58\\ See European Central Bank, Eleventh survey on correspondent \nbanking in euro, November 2020. https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/\nother/\necb.eleventhsurveycorrespondentbankingeuro202011~c280262151.en.pdf.\n    \\59\\ See, generally, CPMI correspondent banking chartpack, \navailable at <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/cpmi/paysysinfo/corr_bank_data/chartpack_2305.pdf\">https://www.bis.org/cpmi/paysysinfo/corr_bank_data/chartpack_2305.pdf</a>, accessed May 5, 2025.\n    \\60\\ See Additional Requests for Comment below, specifically, \nquestions 1 and 9.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Estimating the number of foreign correspondent account openings per \nyear for each bank that maintains them is also challenging. A study by \nthe World Bank indicates that countries often have hundreds of accounts \nclosures and openings per year.\\61\\ This research is also supported by \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF), which reports similar \nfigures.\\62\\ Beginning new foreign correspondent relationships can be \nchallenging and often requires significant upfront deposits.\\63\\ \nHowever, these figures can vary by country, and a large economy like \nthe United States can be expected to have a significant number of \naccount closures and openings each year. FinCEN estimates that each \ncovered bank or broker-dealer with foreign correspondent accounts will \nopen approximately ten new correspondent accounts per year.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\61\\ The World Bank cited an example of one country whose banks \nhad closed 158 foreign correspondent accounts across 66 foreign \nbanks in 17 foreign countries in 2017.

All \ncomments will become a matter of public record.\n    General Request for Comments--Comments are invited on: (1) whether \nthe collection of information is necessary for the proper performance \nof the functions of the agency, including whether the information shall \nhave practical utility; (2) the accuracy of FinCEN estimates of the \nburden of the collection of information; (3) ways to enhance the \nquality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; (4) \nways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on \nrespondents, including through the use of automated collection \ntechniques or other forms of information technology; and (5) estimates \nof capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and \npurchase of services to provide information.\n    Additional Requests for Comment--In connection with a variety of \ninitiatives FinCEN is undertaking to implement the AML Act, FinCEN is \nconducting ongoing, iterative assessments of the PRA burden associated \nwith BSA requirements. To assist with those activities, FinCEN is \naccepting comments responsive to the specific requests included in the \nmost recent prior renewal and is requesting comments in response to the \nadditional questions listed below, which include modifications and \nupdates to questions from the previous renewal as well as new requests \nthat accompany the revised methodology and estimates in this notice.\n    (1) Are there additional sources of data (public, commercial, or \nproprietary, for example) that would enable FinCEN to more precisely \nestimate the number of correspondent accounts that covered financial \ninstitutions maintain in a given year? Would the same sources, or other \nsources, enable FinCEN to estimate the rate of new account openings \nand/or closings of existing accounts on an annual basis as well?\n    (2) Consistent with the intentions communicated in the most recent \nprior renewal notice, FinCEN is working to better harmonize its \ncollective burden estimates across the OMB control numbers in its \nportfolio. In this renewal, it has modified recordkeeping burden \nestimates, in part, to account for the implied per-institution burden \nassociated with 31 CFR 1010.610 (OMB control number 1506-0046). Is the \ncurrent allocation across the different regulatory requirements \ngenerally consistent with current market practices in aggregate? Is it \ngenerally accurate on an incremental or per-item basis? If not, please \nprovide actionable suggestions for improvements upon FinCEN's current \nmethods and estimates.\n    (3) FinCEN considered in the previous OMB control number renewal \nnotice, and continues to consider, the potential overlap in the burden-\ngenerating activities associated with the overall due diligence \nrequirements with respect to correspondent accounts for foreign \nfinancial institutions, including the related program requirements \ndetailed in 31 CFR 1010.610. Are there data, studies, reports, or \nanecdotal information that would improve FinCEN's estimation and \nallocation of PRA burdens to the respective elements of its regulatory \nportfolio? If so, please\n\n[[Page 21996]]\n\ninclude or provide a reference in response.\n    (4) 31 CFR 1010.630(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) exempt foreign banks that \nfile a Form FR Y-7 or are publicly traded (as defined) from the \nrequirement to maintain lists of owners. The current notice does not \nassign an incremental recordkeeping burden to obtaining the information \nnecessary to establish that an exemption is available for a given \nforeign correspondent account. The current notice also does not attempt \nto parse such exempted accounts from its estimate of the number of \ncorrespondent accounts an expected affected financial institution \nmaintains. Is this assignment consistent with current market practices? \nIf not, please provide information about the methods, persons, and time \ninvolved in establishing that an exemption applies.\n    (5) How does a financial institution identify potentially incorrect \ninformation, and what steps does it take, if it has reason to suspect \nthat the information provided by a foreign bank in its certification or \nrecertification is incorrect? Are there any additional steps (beyond a \nrecertification request) taken by the financial institution with \nrespect to the foreign bank's correspondent account if the correct \ninformation cannot be obtained that would generate documentation or \nrecords that must be maintained but are currently unaccounted for in \nFinCEN's estimates (for example, additional requests to the foreign \nbank for additional information or notifications of account \ntermination)? What is the role or level of engagement with senior \nmanagement in this process?\n    (6) FinCEN notes above that it considers interim verifications to \nbe uncommon. What is the likelihood with any given correspondent \naccount that a financial institution would need to conduct an interim \nverification, because it suspects a foreign bank's existing \ncertification information is no longer correct? How long does the \nprocess take?\n    (7) To what extent do estimates that exclude the reporting and \nrecordkeeping burdens on foreign banks potentially underestimate the \nfull PRA burden associated with this OMB control number?\n    (8) Should FinCEN revise its PRA burden estimates to account for \nthe burden on affected foreign banks? Why or why not? If it should, \nplease suggest sources or provide data that would facilitate this \nupdate.\n    (9) Please comment, preferably including, or with reference to, the \ndata relied upon to make such comments, on FinCEN's estimates of the \nnumber of banks that maintain correspondent accounts for foreign banks. \nIn particular, FinCEN invites:\n    (a) public comment on the accuracy of its population estimates.\n    (b) submission of information about the characteristics of affected \nU.S. banks (those that maintain foreign correspondent accounts) that \nmay affect those banks' ability to incur the reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements associated with this FinCEN regulation (such \nas size or operational constraints).\n    (10) Does your financial institution have a process to track \ncorrespondent accounts for foreign banks for reasons other than to \ncomply with BSA requirements?\n    (11) Do covered financial institutions use the sample certification \nform provided by FinCEN for compliance and recordkeeping purposes, or \nis it more common to use a bespoke form or other method to obtain \neither a statement of certification or other information required to \nsatisfy 31 CFR 1010.630 obligations? On average, how long does it take \nto obtain and review the information provided by a foreign bank as part \nof its certification or recertification?\n    (12) Are there instances where a foreign bank seeks to reestablish \na correspondent banking relationship with a covered financial \ninstitution after the foreign bank's correspondent account was closed \ndue to a failure to certify or recertify? If so, how commonly does this \noccur? Are there additional costs associated with these instances?\n\nAndrea M.

Subtitle I, section 106 \ndescribes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, \nAviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's \nauthority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described \nin Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, \nthe FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of \nthe airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the \nefficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority as it amends the route structure to maintain the efficient \nflow of air traffic within the NAS.\n\nComments Invited\n\n    The FAA invites interested persons to participate in this \nrulemaking by submitting written comments, data, or views. Comments are \nspecifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, \nenvironmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal. The most \nhelpful comments reference a specific portion of the proposal, explain \nthe reason for any recommended change, and include supporting data. To \nensure the docket does not contain duplicate comments, commenters \nshould submit only one time if comments are filed electronically, or \ncommenters should send only one copy of written comments if comments \nare filed in writing.\n    The FAA will file in the docket all comments it receives, as well \nas a report\n\n[[Page 21877]]\n\nsummarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel \nconcerning this proposed rulemaking. Before acting on this proposal, \nthe FAA will consider all comments it receives on or before the closing \ndate for comments. The FAA will consider comments filed after the \ncomment period has closed if it is possible to do so without incurring \nexpense or delay. The FAA may change this proposal in light of the \ncomments it receives.\n    Privacy: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments \nfrom the public to better inform its rulemaking process. DOT posts \nthese comments, without edit, including any personal information the \ncommenter provides, to <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>, as described in the system \nof records notice (DOT/ALL-14 FDMS), which can be reviewed at \n<a href=\"http://www.dot.gov/privacy\">www.dot.gov/privacy</a>.\n\nAvailability of Rulemaking Documents\n\n    An electronic copy of this document may be downloaded through the \ninternet at <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>.

An informal docket may also be examined during \nnormal business hours at the office of the Eastern Service Center, \nFederal Aviation Administration, Room 210, 1701 Columbia Avenue, \nCollege Park, GA 30337.\n\nIncorporation by Reference\n\n    United States Area Navigation Routes are published in paragraph \n2006 and paragraph 6011 of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace Designations \nand Reporting Points, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 \non an annual basis. This document proposes to amend the current version \nof that order, FAA Order JO 7400.11J, dated July 31, 2024, and \neffective September 15, 2024. These updates would be published in the \nnext update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA Order JO 7400.11J is publicly \navailable as listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document.\n    FAA Order JO 7400.11J lists Class A, B, C, D, and E airspace areas, \nair traffic service routes, and reporting points.\n\nBackground\n\n    On February 27, 2025 (90 FR 10804), the FAA published an NPRM for \nDocket No. FAA-2025-0295. Subsequent to publication of the NPRM, the \nFAA identified that RNAV route T-461 should have been proposed as a \ndirect overlay of VOR Federal Airway V-44 between the BELTT, NY, Fix \nand the LOVES, CT, Fix. To correct this error, this action proposes to \nadd the EEGOR, CT, WP between the BELTT Fix and the LOVES Fix as \nintended. The DENNA, CT, Fix would remain as a charted point along the \nroute, but because it would be a turn of less than one degree, it would \nbe removed from the legal description.\n    Additionally, the FAA identified that RNAV Route T-705 currently \ncontains the Bridgeport, CT (BDR), Very High Frequency Omnidirectional \nRange/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) which is located 55 feet \nsouthwest of the EEGOR WP. To ensure RNAV structure connectivity \nbetween RNAV Routes T-315, T-461, and T-705 in the Bridgeport, CT area, \nthis action also proposes to remove the Bridgeport VOR/DME and replace \nit with the EEGOR WP. In the current route description of RNAV Route T-\n704, the PAWLN, NY route point is listed as a Fix. This route point is \nidentified as a WP in the National Airspace System Resource (NASR) \ndatabase and charted as a WP accordingly. This SNPRM refers to this \nroute point as a WP.\n    Other components of the proposal from the original NPRM remain \nunchanged.\n\nThe Proposal\n\n    The FAA is proposing an amendment to 14 CFR part 71 to amend RNAV \nRoute T-705 and establish RNAV Routes T-461 in the eastern United \nStates. This action supports continued FAA NextGen efforts to provide a \nmodern RNAV route structure that improves the efficiency of the NAS. \nThe proposed RNAV route changes are described below.\n    T-461: T-461 is a new RNAV route proposed to extend between the \nDeer Park, NY (DPK), VOR/DME and the Albany, NY (ALB), VOR/Tactical Air \nNavigation (VORTAC). The route would overlay VOR Federal Airway V-44 \nbetween the Deer Park VOR/DME and the Albany, NY (ALB), VORTAC. The new \nproposed route would provide RNAV route connectivity between the New \nYork, NY and the Albany, NY areas.\n    T-705: T-705 currently extends between the Nantucket, MA (ACK), \nVOR/DME and the MUTNA, NY, WP. The FAA proposes to remove the \nBridgeport, CT (BDR), VOR/DME and replace it with the EEGOR, CT, WP to \nprovide connectivity to RNAV Routes T-315 and T-461 in the Bridgeport, \nCT area. As amended, the airway would continue to extend between the \nNantucket VOR/DME and the MUTNA WP.\n    This action continues to propose the changes to RNAV routes Q-64 \nand T-414, and the establishment of new RNAV route T-46, as described \nin the original NPRM.\n\nRegulatory Notices and Analyses\n\n    The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves \nan established body of technical regulations for which frequent and \nroutine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. \nIt, therefore: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under \nExecutive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT \nRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); \nand (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the \nanticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that \nwill only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is \ncertified that this proposed rule, when promulgated, will not have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities \nunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nEnvironmental Review\n\n    This proposal will be subject to an environmental analysis in \naccordance with FAA Order 1050.1F, ``Environmental Impacts: Policies \nand Procedures'' prior to any FAA final regulatory action.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71\n\n    Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).\n\nThe Proposed Amendment\n\n    In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows:\n\nPART 71--DESIGNATION OF CLASS A, B, C, D, AND E AIRSPACE AREAS; AIR \nTRAFFIC SERVICE ROUTES; AND REPORTING POINTS\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for 14 CFR part 71 continues to read as \nfollows:\n\n    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 106(g), 40103, 40113, 40120; E.O. \n10854, 24 FR 9565, 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 389.\n\n\nSec.  71.1   [Amended]\n\n0\n2.

Purpose\n\n    The U.S. Government conducts criminal checks to establish that \napplicants or incumbents working for the Government under contract may \nhave unescorted access to federally controlled facilities. GSA uses GSA \nForm 850, Contractor Information Worksheet, and digitally captured \nfingerprints to conduct an FBI National Criminal Information Check \n(NCIC) for each contractor's physical access determination to GSA-\ncontrolled facilities and/or logical access to GSA-controlled \ninformation systems. Manual fingerprint card SF-87 is used for \nexception cases such as contractor's significant geographical distance \nfrom fingerprint enrollment sites.\n    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidance M-05-24 for \nHomeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12, authorizes Federal \ndepartments and agencies to ensure that contractors have limited/\ncontrolled access to facilities and information systems. GSA Directive \nCIO P 2181.1 Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, Personal \nIdentity Verification and Credentialing (available at <a href=\"https://www.gsa.gov/hspd12\">https://www.gsa.gov/hspd12</a>), states that GSA contractors must undergo a minimum \nof an FBI National Criminal Information Check (NCIC) to receive \nunescorted physical access to GSA-controlled facilities and/or logical \naccess to GSA-controlled information systems.\n    Contractors' Social Security Number is needed to keep records \naccurate, because other people may have the same name and birth date. \nExecutive Order 9397, Numbering System for Federal Accounts Relating to \nIndividual Persons, also allows Federal agencies to use this number to \nhelp identify individuals in agency records.\n\nB. Annual Reporting Burden\n\n    Respondents: 22,284.\n    Responses per Respondent: 1.\n    Total Annual Responses: 22,284.\n    Hours per Response: .25.\n    Total Burden Hours: 5,706.\n\nC. Public Comments\n\n    Public comments are particularly invited on: Whether this \ncollection of information is necessary and whether it will have \npractical utility; whether our estimate of the public burden of this \ncollection of information is accurate and based on valid assumptions \nand methodology; ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of \nthe information to be collected.\n    Obtaining Copies of Proposals: Requesters may obtain a copy of the \ninformation collection documents from the GSA Regulatory Secretariat \nDivision, by calling 202-501-4755 or emailing <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2b6c786a794e4c784e486b4c584a054c445d\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"24637765764143774147644357450a434b52\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

TSA is \ncontinuing to assess its need for, and use of, information that \nidentifies sex. Specific use cases will be addressed separately from \nthe technical amendments in this rulemaking.\n    The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(B)(3)(b)) \nprovides that when an agency for good cause finds that notice and \npublic procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the \npublic interest, an agency may issue a rule without providing notice \nand an opportunity for public comment. TSA has determined that there is \ngood cause for making this technical amendment final without prior \nproposal and opportunity for\n\n[[Page 21690]]\n\ncomment because the revisions are not substantive and will have no \nimpact on the regulatory requirements in the affected parts. TSA has \ndetermined that public comment on such administrative changes is \nunnecessary and that there is good cause under the APA for proceeding \nwith a final rule.\n    TSA has also determined that this rule is exempt from the notice \nand comment requirement under the APA because it is a rule of agency \norganization, procedure, or practice. (See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)) Because \nthe rule is simply an administrative change that replaces terminology \nwithout altering the rights or interests of parties, it has no \nsubstantive effect on the regulatory requirements and places no stamp \nof approval or disapproval on any type of behavior. Accordingly, TSA is \nissuing this rule in its final form as a procedural rule.\n    Further, because a notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity \nfor public comment are not required for this rule under the APA or any \nother law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) are not applicable. Accordingly, this rule \nis issued in final form.\n    Before a rule can take effect, the Congressional Review Act (CRA), \nas codified at 5 U.S.C. 801-808, requires Federal agencies to submit \nthe rule and a report to Congress and the Comptroller General \nindicating whether it is a major rule. Under 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(C), rules \nof agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not \nsubstantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties \nare not considered rules for the purposes of the CRA. This technical \namendment is a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that \nwill not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency \nparties. Thus, TSA is not required to submit the rule for review under \nthe CRA.\n\nList of Subjects\n\n6 CFR Part 37\n\n    Classified information, Freedom of information, Licensing and \nregistration, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles, Personally-\nidentifiable information, Privacy, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements, Security measures.\n\n49 CFR Part 1500\n\n    Air carriers, Air transportation, Aircraft, Airports, Buses, \nHazardous materials transportation, Law enforcement officers, Maritime \ncarriers, Mass transportation, Railroad safety, Railroads, Reporting \nand recordkeeping requirements, Security measures, Transportation, \nVessels.\n\n49 CFR Part 1540\n\n    Air carriers, Airports, Aviation safety, Law enforcement officers, \nReporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures.\n\n49 CFR Part 1560\n\n    Air transportation, Law enforcement officers, Reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements, Security measures.\n\n49 CFR Part 1572\n\n    Crime, Explosives, Hazardous materials transportation, Motor \ncarriers, Railroads, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security \nmeasures.\n\nThe Amendments\n\n    For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Transportation Security \nAdministration amends chapter I of title 6, and chapter XII of title \n49, Code of Federal Regulations, as follows:\n\nPART 37--REAL ID DRIVER'S LICENSES AND IDENTIFICATION CARDS\n\n0\n1.

Code sentences that have been aggregated \nby the U.S. Bureau of Prisons (``mixed code'' offenders) and considered \nfor parole on the basis of a single parole eligibility and mandatory \nrelease date on the aggregate sentence.\n\nDATES: This regulation is effective May 21, 2025.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Helen Krapels, General Counsel, U.S. \nParole Commission, 90 K Street NE, Third Floor, Washington, DC 20530, \ntelephone (202) 346-7031. Questions about this publication are welcome, \nbut\n\n[[Page 21694]]\n\ninquiries concerning individual cases cannot be answered over the \ntelephone.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 28 CFR 2.65 pertains to the procedure for \nconsidering ``mixed code'' cases, i.e., offenders serving D.C. Code and \nU.S. Code sentences that the U.S. Bureau of Prisons has aggregated into \none sentence. As a result of the D.C. Circuit Court's ruling in Ford v. \nMassarone, 902 F.3d 309 (D.C. Cir. 2018), and the limited number of \ncases that this regulation would apply to, the U.S. Parole Commission \nhas decided to remove 28 CFR 2.65. In Ford, the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals found that the prisoner with an aggregate federal and District \nof Columbia sentence was entitled to have his initial D.C. parole \nhearing on the date he had served his minimum D.C. sentence, rather \nthan shortly before his subsequent projected federal parole date, even \nthough the prisoner would need to remain in prison on his federal \nsentence until his federal parole date. By removing 28 CFR 2.65, the \nU.S. Parole Commission will schedule ``mixed code'' prisoners for their \ninitial parole hearing based on the parole eligibility date of their \naggregate sentence as calculated by the Bureau of Prisons. The U.S. \nParole Commission will evaluate whether the prisoner should be paroled \nunder both federal and D.C. code parole statutes and regulations. To \naddress any remaining ``mixed code'' prisoners, detailed guidance will \nbe provided to agency staff as to the procedures noted in Ford v. \nMassarone.\n    Because this is a procedural rule, the matter was voted on \nseriatim.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866, 13563 and 14219\n\n    This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with \nExecutive Order 12866, ``Regulation Planning and Review,'' section \n1(b), Principles of Regulation; Executive Order 13565, ``Improving \nRegulation and Regulatory Review,'' section 1(b), General Principles of \nRegulation; and Executive Order 14219, ``Ensuring Lawful Governance and \nImplementing the President's `Department of Government Efficiency' \nDeregulatory Initiative.'' The Commission has determined that this rule \nis not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, \nsection 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule \nhas not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nExecutive Order 13132\n\n    This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, \non the relationship between the national government and the States, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \nlevels of government. Under Executive Order 13132, this rule does not \nhave sufficient federalism implications requiring a Federalism \nAssessment.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    This rule will not have a significant economic impact upon a \nsubstantial number of small entities within the meaning of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b).\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    This rule will not cause State, local, or tribal governments, or \nthe private sector, to spend $100,000,000 or more in any one year, and \nit will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. No \naction under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 is necessary.\n\nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Subtitle \nE--Congressional Review Act)\n\n    This rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined by Section 804 of the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 Subtitle E--\nCongressional Review Act, now codified at 5 U.S.C. 804(2). The rule \nwill not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or \nmore; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse \neffects on the ability of United States-based companies to compete with \nforeign-based companies. Moreover, this is a rule of agency practice or \nprocedure that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations \nof non-agency parties, and does not come within the meaning of the term \n``rule'' as used in Section 804(3)(C), now codified at 5 U.S.C. \n804(3)(C). Therefore, the reporting requirement of 5 U.S.C. 801 does \nnot apply.\n\nList of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 2\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Prisoners, Probation and \nparole.\n\nThe Final Rule\n\n    Accordingly, the U.S. Parole Commission is amending 28 CFR part 2 \nto read as follows:\n\nPART 2--PAROLE, RELEASE, SUPERVISION AND RECOMMITMENT OF PRISONERS, \nYOUTH OFFENDERS, AND JUVENILE DELINQUENTS\n\n0\n1.

Background Information and Regulatory History\n\n    The Manitowoc River is 35.8 miles long and flows into Lake Michigan \nat the town of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Large commercial vessels, along \nwith powered and unpowered recreational vessels, use the navigable \nportion of the river that extends from the mouth of the river to the \nhead of navigation at mile 2.33. There are two movable bridges over the \nriver.\n    The Eighth Street Bridge, mile 0.29 is a double leaf bascule bridge \nthat provides a horizontal clearance of 120 feet and a vertical \nclearance of 12 feet above LWD in the closed position and an unlimited \nclearance in the open position.\n    The Tenth Street Bridge, mile 0.43, is a double leaf bascule bridge \nthat provides a horizontal clearance of 120 feet and a vertical \nclearance of 14 feet above LWD in the closed position and an unlimited \nclearance in the open position.\n    Both bridges over the Manitowoc River have operated under a special \nregulation (33 CFR 117.1089) since 1920, with the last modernization to \nthe regulation occurring in 1955. Since the last review, there have \nbeen several important changes to commerce on the river. Specifically, \nthe Wisconsin Central Railroad Bascule Bridge and the Wisconsin Central \nRailroad Swing Bridge that previously crossed the river have been \nremoved in their entirety. Additionally, the three ferries operated by \nrailroad companies have stopped servicing Manitowoc, Wisconsin.\n    The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary interim rule without \nprior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under 5 \nU.S.C. 553(b). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule \nwithout prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for \ngood cause finds that those procedures are ``impracticable, \nunnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' Under 5 U.S.C. \n553(b), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing \na notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to this rule because it is \ncontrary to the public interest to delay the issuance of the rule and \nthe beneficial impacts it provides to the local community and users of \nthe waterway. The bridge is currently only required to remain closed to \nnavigation for short 10-minute periods during commuting hours causing \nhigh vehicle congestion. This temporary operating schedule adjusts the \ndesignated drawbridge opening times to assist with vehicle congestion. \nWe lack sufficient time to issue a proposed rule and consider comments \nprior to needing to begin the temporary deviation to the operating \nschedule.\n    Also, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good \ncause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after \npublication in the Federal Register. Delaying the effective date of \nthis rule would be impracticable because action is needed to respond to \nchange in drawbridge schedule starting on May 22, 2025. The Coast Guard \nis soliciting comments on this temporary interim rule. If the Coast \nGuard determines that changes to the temporary interim rule are \nnecessary, we will publish a temporary final rule or other appropriate \ndocument. If the Coast Guard determines that no changes are necessary \nto the schedule provided in this rule, we may finalize the operating \nschedule as permanent upon completion of the approved deviation.\n\nIII. Legal Authority and Need for Rule\n\n    The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in 33 U.S.C. \n499.\n    Public concern that vehicles unloaded from the ferry, the S.S. \nBadger, brought to downtown Manitowoc from Ludington, Michigan were \ncausing vehicle traffic congestion at the Eighth Street Bridge, mile \n0.29 and the Tenth Street Bridge, mile 0.43, prompted the City of \nManitowoc, Wisconsin, to request special bridge hours when the S.S. \nBadger unloads vehicles. After a formal inquiry into the operations of \nthe S.S. Badger, it was determined that their slow loading and \noffloading process did not cause vehicle congestion to downtown \nManitowoc.\n    Thus, to improve the flow of vehicles across the city, WisDOT, in \ncooperation with the City of Manitowoc, completed studies to make \nroadway improvements. The studies indicated that a combined 20,600 \nvehicles cross over the Eighth Street Bridge, mile 0.29 and the Tenth \nStreet Bridge, mile 0.43, daily. Proposed solutions to traffic \ncongestion include instituting one-way traffic on each bridge to \nfacilitate efficient traffic flows. To further ease vehicle congestion, \nthe state of Wisconsin has designed a roundabout to the north and south \nof the bridges to alleviate vehicles sitting at traffic lights or stop \nsigns. This will help create a better flow of vehicles rather than \nseveral small surges of vehicles trying to cross the bridges.\n    In order to try to minimize traffic congestion in downtown \nManitowoc and to meet the reasonable needs of navigation, the Coast \nGuard will be authorizing a TIR for the Eighth Street Bridge, mile 0.29 \nand the Tenth Street Bridge, mile 0.43, to allow the public to test the \nproposed regulation and comment on its effectiveness.\n    After reviewing drawtender logs for each of the two bridges, we \ndiscovered each bridge opens over 500 times annually, and most openings \noccur between May and October of each year. Of the total openings, \napproximately 237 openings were done to accommodate recreational \nvessels, and 263 openings were done to accommodate commercial vessels. \nThis data provides a roughly equal balance of openings between the \nprimary vessel types (recreational and commercial).\n    Currently, the regulations provide that, from April 1 through \nOctober 31, the bridges provide two 10-minute periods (6:50 a.m. to 7 \na.m., and 7:50 a.m. to 8 a.m.) and two 15-minute periods (11:55 a.m. to \n12:10 p.m., and 12:45 p.m. to 1 p.m.) each day, during which the bridge \nneed not open, to alleviate vehicle congestion at the bridges. The \nregulations also include a 6-hour advance notice required for openings \nduring a 6-hour period between 10:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. The current \nregulation was drafted by the railroads and approved by the United \nStates Department of War one hundred and four years ago. The regulation \nwas groundbreaking when it was first conceived, but by modern \nstandards, operations of the bridge are cumbersome, as the existing \nregulation does not account for the increase in population. It is also \noutdated by the loss of the original railroads. Four short periods to \nallow vehicles to cross the bridges is an antiquated process that does \nnot meet the current need of land transportation. We reviewed the \nhourly vehicular traffic logs from the city and discovered each bridge \nhandles over 10,500 cars daily with three hours that peak for vehicle \ncrossings. The three periods are in the morning while people are \ntraveling to work, mid-day when people are traveling for lunch, and \nevening when people tend to leave work for home. The vehicle counts \nprovided by the city show 1610 vehicles on\n\n[[Page 21696]]\n\naverage cross the bridges in the morning rush hour from 7 a.m. to 8 \na.m., 2370 vehicles cross the bridge a from 11 a.m. to noon, and 2855 \nvehicles cross the bridges from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. These three rush-hours \ncombined for both bridges would facilitate 6835 vehicles throughout \ndowntown.\n\nIV. Discussion of the Rule\n\n    Under the new regulation, the times the bridges remain closed to \nalleviate motor vehicle traffic congestion will be scheduled for three \nseparate hour-long periods during the morning (7 a.m. to 8 a.m.), \nmidday (11 a.m. to noon), and evening (4 p.m. to 5 p.m.) rush-hours \nwhen traffic is the busiest. If the bridges remain open during these \ntimes, based on the rush hour traffic patterns, the roads will become \nmore congested, making it difficult for vehicles to travel efficiently. \nAs more drivers learn of these mandated periods where the bridge is not \nrequired to open, we speculate more drivers will adjust their schedules \nto cross the bridges during these times.\n    Furthermore, the old regulation requires special sound signals to \nrequest openings for each bridge. This is an antiquated system long \novertaken by the utility and popularity of VHF-FM Marine Radios and \ncellular telephones (utilized in most vessel calls to the bridges when \nrequesting openings). By removing these specialized series of horn \nblasts in the new regulation, we will simplify the process and make the \nrule easier to understand and remember.\n    Weekend and holiday tourism patterns diverge heavily from weekday \npatterns. As a result, on weekends and holidays, the bridges will open \non signal during the day, but not during the evenings. This change will \navoid impeding trade or travel levels typically associated with these \ntraditional non-working days.\n    The current regulation allows for a deviation for six hours in the \nevening from the general requirement in 33 CFR 117.7(a) to man the \ndrawbridge with drawtenders (10:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m.) and requires \nmariners to provide six hours advance notice when requesting bridge \nopenings. The current regulation is generally unaccommodating to \nmariners and creates a potential safety risk to mariners seeking safe \nharbor from storms. It requires a 6-hour notice for an opening, but the \nclosure itself is 6-hours in duration. As a result, ships traveling to \nManitowoc or leaving port who are running a little late from loading or \nunloading cargo may need to wait until morning for the bridge to open. \nTo better accommodate vessels which may require an opening, we are \nadjusting the evening and morning hours by 30 minutes (10 p.m. to 4 \na.m.) and are also reducing the advance notice to 2 hours, instead of 6 \nhours, based on times when vessels seldom request openings.\n    The current regulation lists winter hours starting on November 1 \nand ending on March 31. Drawtender logs show the bridges open an \naverage of 75 times during the month of November. Moving the winter \nhours to begin on December 1 would relieve the mariners from the burden \nof the advance notice requirements in November and would allow the city \nto have a drawtender on duty during the busy November months, without \nrecalling personnel to operate the bridges. Therefore, the new \nregulation includes a provision changing the beginning of the winter \nhours to December 1.\n    We are considering making this temporary interim rule's regulation \nfor the drawbridge operation permanent and request public comment on \nthat path.\n    On April 30, 2024, we emailed a draft copy of the proposed \ntemporary rule to the City of Manitowoc, Lake Carriers Association, \nRand Logistics Incorporated, and Chamber of Marine Commerce for initial \ncomments prior to publishing the test deviation on <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>. \nWe did not receive any negative comments, but we did receive one \nsupporting comment by phone from a commercial mariner.\n    We view public participation as essential to effective rulemaking \nand will consider all comments and material received during the comment \nperiod. Your comment can help shape the outcome of this rulemaking. If \nyou submit a comment, please include the docket number for this \nrulemaking, indicate the specific section of this document to which \neach comment applies, and provide a reason for each suggestion or \nrecommendation. Your comments will help us determine if this operating \nschedule should become the new permanent operating schedule.\n    We encourage you to submit comments through the Federal Decision-\nMaking Portal at <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>. To do so, go to <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>, type USCG-2024-0407 in the search box and click \n``Search.'' Next, look for this document in the Search Results column, \nand click on it. Then click on the Comment option. If your material \ncannot be submitted using <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>, contact the \nperson in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this document \nfor alternate instructions.\n\nV. Regulatory Analyses\n\n    We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and \nExecutive Orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses \nbased on a number of these statutes and Executive Orders.\n\nA. Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the \ncosts and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits. This rule has not been designated a ``significant \nregulatory action,'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. \nAccordingly, it has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB).\n    This regulatory action determination is based on the ability that \nvessels can still transit the bridge given advanced notice.\n\nB. Impact on Small Entities\n\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as \namended, requires federal agencies to consider the potential impact of \nregulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term ``small \nentities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations \nthat are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their \nfields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than \n50,000.\n    While some owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the \nbridge may be small entities, for the reasons stated in section V.A \nabove, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on any \nvessel owner or operator.\n    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small \nentities in understanding this rule. If the rule would affect your \nsmall business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have \nquestions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please \ncontact the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT \nsection.\n    Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal \nemployees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal \nregulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory \nEnforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory \nFairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and \nrates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to \ncomment on actions by\n\n[[Page 21697]]\n\nemployees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The \nCoast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or \ncomplain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.\n\nC. Collection of Information\n\n    This rule calls for no new collection of information under the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nD. Federalism and Indian Tribal Government\n\n    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, \nFederalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on the \nrelationship between the national government and the States, or on the \ndistribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of \ngovernment. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have \ndetermined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism \nprinciples and preemption requirements described in Executive Order \n13132.\n    Also, this rule does not have tribal implications under Executive \nOrder 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal \nGovernments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on \none or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and \nresponsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.\n\nE. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) \nrequires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary \nregulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may \nresult in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in \nthe aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for \ninflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in \nsuch an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere \nin this preamble.\n\nF. Environment\n\n    We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security \nManagement Directive 023-01, Rev. 1, associated implementing \ninstructions, and Environmental Planning Policy COMDTINST 5090.1 \n(series) which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f).

ATCA is the implementing statute for binding \nrecommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of \nAtlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The HMS FMP and its amendments are implemented \nby regulations at 50 CFR part 635. Section 635.27(a) divides the U.S. \nBFT quota, established by ICCAT and as implemented by the United States \namong the various domestic fishing categories, per the allocations \nestablished in the HMS FMP and its amendments. NMFS is required under \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1854(g)(1)(D) to provide U.S. \nfishing vessels with a reasonable opportunity to harvest quotas under \nrelevant\n\n[[Page 21698]]\n\ninternational fishery agreements such as the ICCAT Convention, which is \nimplemented domestically pursuant to ATCA.\n    Under Sec.  635.28(a)(1), NMFS files a closure notice with the \nOffice of the Federal Register for publication when a BFT quota (or \nsubquota) is reached or is projected to be reached. Retaining, \npossessing, or landing BFT under that quota category is prohibited on \nand after the effective date and time of a closure notice for that \ncategory, for the remainder of the fishing year, until the opening of \nthe subsequent quota period or until such date as specified.\n    Every year, the BFT fishing year starts on January 1 and ends on \nDecember 31. The Angling category opens on January 1 and continues \nthrough December 31 or until the applicable quota or subquota is \nreached or projected to be reached, whichever comes first. As described \nin Sec.  635.27(a), the current baseline U.S. BFT quota is 1,316.14 \nmetric tons (mt) (not including the 25 mt ICCAT allocated to the United \nStates to account for bycatch of BFT in pelagic longline fisheries in \nthe Northeast Distant Gear Restricted Area per Sec.  635.27(a)(3)). The \nAngling category baseline quota is 297.4 mt, of which 9.2 mt (3.1 \npercent of the annual Angling category quota) is sub-allocated for the \nharvest of large medium and giant (trophy) BFT by vessels fishing under \nthe Angling category quota, with 2.3 mt (25 percent of the annual large \nmedium and giant BFT Angling category quota) allocated for each of the \nfour areas delineated at Sec.  635.27(a)(2)(iii), including the area \nthat is south of 42[deg] N lat. and north of 39[deg]18' N lat. (the \nsouthern New England area). Trophy BFT measure 73 inches (185 cm) \ncurved fork length or greater. This closure action applies to the \nsouthern New England area.\n\nAngling Category Trophy Bluefin Tuna Southern New England Area Fishery \nClosure\n\n    Based on landings data from the NMFS Automated Catch Reporting \nSystem, as well as average catch rates and anticipated fishing \nconditions, NMFS has determined the Angling category southern New \nEngland area trophy BFT subquota of 2.3 mt is projected to be reached \nand exceeded shortly. Therefore, retaining, possessing, or landing \nlarge medium or giant (i.e., measuring 73 inches (185 cm) curved fork \nlength or greater) BFT south of 42[deg] N lat. and north of 39[deg]18' \nN lat by persons aboard HMS Angling and HMS Charter/Headboat permitted \nvessels (when fishing recreationally) must cease at 11:30 p.m. local \ntime on May 16, 2025. This closure will remain effective through \nDecember 31, 2025. This action applies to HMS Angling and HMS Charter/\nHeadboat permitted vessels when fishing recreationally for BFT, and is \ntaken consistent with the regulations at Sec.  635.28(a)(1). This \naction is intended to prevent overharvest of the Angling category \nsouthern New England area trophy BFT subquota.\n    If needed to ensure available quotas or subquotas are not exceeded \nor to enhance fishing opportunities, subsequent Angling category \nadjustments or closures will be published in the Federal Register per \nSec. Sec.  635.27(a)(7) and 635.28(a)(1). Information regarding the \nAngling category fishery for Atlantic tunas, including daily retention \nlimits for BFT measuring 27 inches (68.5 cm) to less than 73 inches \n(185 cm), and any further Angling category adjustments, is available at \n<a href=\"https://hmspermits.noaa.gov\">https://hmspermits.noaa.gov</a>. During a closure, fishermen aboard HMS \nAngling and HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels when fishing \nrecreationally may continue to catch and release (or tag and release) \nBFT of all sizes, subject to the requirements of the catch-and-release \nand tag-and-release programs at Sec.  635.26. All BFT that are released \nmust be handled in a manner that will maximize survival, and without \nremoving the fish from the water, consistent with requirements at Sec.  \n635.21(a)(1). For additional information on safe handling, see the \n``Careful Catch and Release'' brochure available at <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/outreach-and-education/careful-catch-and-release-brochure/\">https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/outreach-and-education/careful-catch-and-release-brochure/</a>.\n\nMonitoring and Reporting\n\n    NMFS will continue to monitor the BFT fisheries closely. Per Sec.  \n635.5(c)(1), HMS Angling and HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessel \nowners are required to report the catch of all BFT retained or \ndiscarded dead, within 24 hours of the landing(s) or end of each trip, \nby accessing <a href=\"https://hmspermits.noaa.gov\">https://hmspermits.noaa.gov</a>, using the HMS Catch Reporting \napp, or calling (888) 872-8862 (Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. until \n4:30 p.m.).\n\nClassification\n\n    NMFS issues this action pursuant to section 305(d) of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1855(d)) and regulations at 50 CFR part 635, and \nthis action is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.\n    The Assistant Administrator for NMFS (AA) finds that pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. 553(b)(B), there is good cause to waive prior notice of, and an \nopportunity for public comment on, this action because it is \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest for the following \nreasons. Specifically, the regulations implementing the HMS FMP and its \namendments provide for inseason retention limit adjustments and fishery \nclosures to respond to the unpredictable nature of BFT availability on \nthe fishing grounds, the migratory nature of this species, and the \nregional variations in the BFT fishery. Providing for prior notice and \nopportunity to comment is impracticable and contrary to the public \ninterest as this fishery is currently underway and, based on the most \nrecent landings information, the Angling category southern New England \narea trophy BFT fishery subquota is projected to be reached and \nexceeded shortly. Delaying this action could result in excessive trophy \nBFT landings that may result in future potential quota reductions for \nthe Angling category, depending on the magnitude of a potential Angling \ncategory overharvest. NMFS must close the southern New England area \ntrophy BFT fishery before additional landings of these sizes of BFT \noccur. Taking this action does not raise conservation and management \nconcerns, and would support effective management of the BFT fishery. \nNMFS notes that the public had an opportunity to comment on the \nunderlying rulemakings that established the U.S. BFT quota and the \ninseason adjustment criteria.\n    For all of the above reasons, the AA also finds that pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. 553(d), there is good cause to waive the 30-day delay in \neffectiveness.\n\n    Authority: 16 U.S.C. 971 et seq. and 1801 et seq.\n\n    Dated: May 15, 2025.\nKelly Denit,\nDirector, Office of Sustainable Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries \nService.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09075 Filed 5-16-25; 4:15 pm]\nBILLING CODE 3510-22-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

In \nthis capacity the Agency also prepares a number of associated estimates \naffecting the agriculture industry, such as this Cold Storage report. \nThis monthly survey provides information on national supplies of food \nin refrigerated storage facilities. A biennial survey of refrigerated \nwarehouses is also conducted to provide a benchmark of the capacity \navailable for refrigerated storage of the nation's food supply.\n    Providing information on national supplies of food in refrigerated \nstorage facilities has been the responsibility of the Department of \nAgriculture since 1914. This service is the outcome of an investigation \nmade by the Department in 1911, in response to allegations that food \nwarehouses were being used by food speculators to ``corner the market'' \nand drive up prices paid by consumers. The Secretary of Agriculture \nrecommended that the public should know the amounts of foods in \nwarehouses and that the Department should issue periodic reports on a \npre-announced date and time.\n    General authority for these data collection activities is granted \nunder U.S. Code title 7, section 2204. This statute specifies that \n``The Secretary of Agriculture shall procure and preserve all \ninformation concerning agriculture which he can obtain . . . by the \ncollection of statistics . . . and shall distribute them among \nagriculturists.''\n    Need and Use of the Information: The monthly Cold Storage reports \ninclude inventory statistics for approximately 110 food items held in \npublic, private, and semi-private refrigerated warehouses. USDA \nagencies such as the World Agricultural Outlook Board, Economic \nResearch Service, and Agricultural Marketing Service use information \nfrom the Cold Storage reports in administering government commodity \nprograms and in supply and demand analysis. Included in the reports are \nstocks of frozen orange juice concentrate, butter, and cheese, which \nare traded on the Chicago Board of Trade.\n    Description of Respondents: Business or other for-profit; Farms.\n    Number of Respondents: 1,567.\n    Frequency of Responses: Reporting: Monthly; Annually.\n    Total Burden Hours: 5,145.\n\nNational Agricultural Statistics Service\n\n    Title: Custom Work Survey.\n    OMB Control Number: 0535-0266.\n    Summary of Collection: The primary functions of the National \nAgricultural Statistics Service (NASS) are to prepare and issue current \nofficial State and national estimates of crop and livestock production, \ndisposition, prices, resource use, and to collect information on \nrelated environmental and economic factors. NASS's cooperators have \nsought NASS's assistance to provide custom rates statistics beneficial \nto agriculture; these statistics are not covered by NASS's annual \nCongressional appropriation.\n    General authority for these data collection activities is granted \nunder U.S. Code title 7, section 2204. This statute specifies that \n``The Secretary of Agriculture shall procure and preserve all \ninformation concerning agriculture which he can obtain . . . by the \ncollection of statistics . . . and shall distribute them among \nagriculturists.''\n    Need and Use of the Information: NASS will conduct a sample survey \nof agricultural operations that have knowledge of rates for custom \nagricultural work. The universe is composed of all active agricultural \noperations in the states that are conducting a survey. The sampled \noperations will be asked several screening questions. Those that \nqualify to respond to the survey will be asked to provide rates for any \ncustom agricultural work for which they have knowledge. Individuals \nthat do not operate a farm or that do not have a knowledge of custom \nrates will screen out of the survey. The purpose of the survey is to \ncollect custom rates from agricultural workers.\n    Description of Respondents: Business or other for-profit; Farms.\n    Number of Respondents: 41,500.\n    Frequency of Responses: Reporting: Annually.\n    Total Burden Hours: 15,027.\n\n[[Page 21737]]\n\nNational Agricultural Statistics Service\n\n    Title: Cooperator Funded Chemical Use Surveys.\n    OMB Control Number: 0535-0273.\n    Summary of Collection: The primary function of the National \nAgricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is to prepare and issue current \nofficial State and national estimates of crop and livestock production, \nvalue, disposition, and resource use. General authority for these data \ncollection activities is granted under U.S. Code title 7, section 2204. \nThis statute specifies that ``The Secretary of Agriculture shall \nprocure and preserve all information concerning agriculture which he \ncan obtain . . . by the collection of statistics . . . and shall \ndistribute them among agriculturists.'' NASS's cooperators have sought \nNASS's assistance to provide statistics beneficial to agriculture but \nare not covered by NASS's annual Congressional appropriation.\n    Data collected in the Maryland Pesticide Usage Survey will provide \nthe Maryland Dept. of Agriculture (MdDA) with comprehensive information \nabout what pesticides are being used around the state and future \nsurveys will help determine what trends are developing. The data will \nalso help agriculture and industry professionals understand what is \nbeing used, and it will provide public and environmental health experts \nwith information that can help them focus their research and monitoring \nefforts.\n    The primary use for the Minnesota Pesticide and Fertilizer Survey \ndata will be to allow the Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture (MnDA) staff \nto evaluate the effectiveness and adoption levels of the voluntary Best \nManagement Practice (BMP) guidelines by periodically summarizing \npesticide and fertilizer use statistics at the county level and MnDA \nmanagement district levels. County level detail is needed because there \nare different BMPs written for specific Pesticide Management Areas \n(PMA) based on chemical residue found in ground water or surface water \nthrough other monitoring means. Fertilizer data will be summarized \nunder different Nitrogen Best Management Practice Regions based on soil \ntypes and a separate monitoring program. Results from the Minnesota \nPesticide and Fertilizer Best Management Practices Survey will allow \nthe MnDA staff to promote the voluntary nature of the BMPs by \ndemonstrating the adoption levels and practices farmers are using have \nremained consistent with the BMP guidelines. If verified, this will \navoid the need for any mandatory restrictions on chemical use and/or \npractices.\n    The primary use for the Mississippi State University Extension \nService's (MSUES) Field Crop Production Practice and Chemical Use \nSurveys will be to create Enterprise Budgets for corn, cotton, rice, \nwheat, and soybeans. No chemical use data will be published, but \nchemical use data are an important part of determining Enterprise \nBudgets.\n    The Illinois Nutrient Loss Reduction Strategy (NLRS) survey will be \nconducted on an every-other year basis (for odd numbered years) through \na cooperative agreement with the Illinois Nutrient Research Education \nCouncil, developed by the Illinois Department of Agriculture. The goal \nof this survey is to produce statistically defensible estimates of \nseveral ``in field'' and ``edge of field'' practices conducted by \nIllinois farmers. These practices have been shown to positively impact \nwater quality by reducing runoff and leaching of nutrients into the \nwaters of Illinois. One of the primary goals of the NLRS is to track \nimplementation of these cultural practices over time to measure \nimplementation of the NLRS.\n    Need and Use of the Information: The Field Crop Production Practice \nand Chemical Use Surveys in this request will be conducted to meet \nresearch and publication goals for Extension and State Departments of \nAgriculture. The summarized and published information will be analyzed \nby the sponsoring cooperators and stakeholders in agriculture. Results \nwill be used to study production agriculture, as well as various \nprograms and policies to determine their impact on agricultural \nproducers and consumers.\n    Description of Respondents: Businesses or other for-profits; Farms \nand ranches.\n    Number of Respondents: 24,200.\n    Frequency of Responses: Reporting: Annually.\n    Total Burden Hours: 11,571.\n\nLevi S.

Section 723(a)(2) of the DPA directs the Secretary of \nCommerce (Secretary) to prepare the President's report and to develop \nand administer the regulations necessary to collect offsets data from \nU.S. defense exporters.\n    The authorities of the Secretary regarding offsets have been \ndelegated to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security. \nThe regulations associated with offsets reporting are set forth in 15 \nCFR part 701 (Offsets Regulations). Offsets are compensation practices \nrequired as a condition of purchase in either government-to-government \nor commercial sales of defense articles and/or defense services, as \ndefined by the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) and the \nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR 120 through 130). \nOffsets are also applicable to certain items controlled on the Commerce \nControl list (CCL) and with an Export Control Classification Number \n(ECCN) including the numeral ``6'' as its third character. The CCL is \nfound in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the Export Administration \nRegulations (EAR).\n    An example of an offset is as follows: a company that is selling a \nfleet of military aircraft to a foreign government may agree to offset \nthe cost of the aircraft by providing training assistance to plant \nmanagers in the purchasing\n\n[[Page 21739]]\n\ncountry. Although this distorts the true price of the aircraft, the \nforeign government may require this sort of extra compensation as a \ncondition of awarding the contract to purchase the aircraft. As \ndescribed in the Offsets Regulations, U.S. firms are required to report \ninformation on contracts for the sale of defense articles or defense \nservices to foreign countries or foreign firms that are subject to \noffsets agreements exceeding $5,000,000 in value. U.S. firms are also \nrequired to report annually information on offsets transactions \ncompleted in performance of existing offsets commitments for which an \noffsets credit of $250,000 or more has been claimed from the foreign \nrepresentative.\n    Commerce's annual report to Congress includes an aggregated summary \nof the data reported by industry in accordance with the Offsets \nRegulations and the DPA (50 U.S.C. 4568). As provided by section 723(c) \nof the DPA, BIS will not publicly disclose individual firm information \nit receives through offsets reporting unless the firm furnishing the \ninformation specifically authorizes public disclosure. The information \ncollected is sorted and organized into an aggregate report of national \noffsets data and therefore does not identify company-specific \ninformation.\n    To enable BIS to prepare the next annual offsets report reflecting \ncalendar year 2024 data, affected U.S. firms must submit required \ninformation on offsets agreements and offsets transactions from \ncalendar year 2024 to BIS no later than June 15, 2025.\n\nJulia Khersonsky,\nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09139 Filed 5-20-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 3510-JT-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Consistent with section 732(b)(1) \nof the Act, the Petitions were accompanied by information reasonably \navailable to the petitioners supporting its allegations.\n    Commerce finds that the petitioners filed the Petitions on behalf \nof the domestic industry, because the petitioners are interested \nparties, as defined in section 771(9)(C) of the Act. Commerce also \nfinds that the petitioners demonstrated sufficient industry support for \nthe initiation of the requested LTFV investigations.\\5\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See section on ``Determination of Industry Support for the \nPetitions,'' infra.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPeriods of Investigations (POI)\n\n    Because the Petitions were filed on April 24, 2025, pursuant to 19 \nCFR 351.204(b)(1), the period of investigation (POI) for the Angola, \nAustralia, Laos, and Norway LTFV investigations is April 1, 2024, \nthrough March 31, 2025. The petitioners argued that Commerce should \ndetermine in these investigations that Angola and Laos are non-market \neconomies (NMEs) within the meaning of section 771(18)(A) of the Act \nand should calculate normal value (NV) for both countries in accordance \nwith its NME methodology.\\6\\ Under the NME methodology for the Angola \nand Laos LTFV investigations, the appropriate POI is October 1, 2024, \nthrough March 31, 2025, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.204(b)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ See Petitions at Volume II at 1-2 and Exhibit II-1; see also \nPetitions at Volume V at 1-2 and Exhibit V-1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScope of the Investigations\n\n    The product covered by these investigations is silicon metal from \nAngola, Australia, Laos, and Norway. For a full description of the \nscope of these investigations, see the appendix to this notice.\n\nComments on the Scope of the Investigations\n\n    As discussed in the Preamble to Commerce's regulations, we are \nsetting aside a period for interested parties to raise issues regarding \nproduct coverage (i.e., scope).\\7\\ Commerce will consider all scope \ncomments received from interested parties and, if necessary, will \nconsult with interested parties prior to the issuance of the \npreliminary determinations. If scope comments include factual \ninformation,\\8\\ all such factual information should be limited to \npublic information. Commerce requests that interested parties provide \nat the beginning of their scope comments a public executive summary for \neach comment or issue raised in their submission. Commerce further \nrequests that interested parties limit their public executive summary \nof each comment or issue to no more than 450 words, not including \ncitations. Commerce intends to use the public executive summaries as \nthe basis of the comment summaries included in the analysis of scope \ncomments. To facilitate preparation of its questionnaires, Commerce \nrequests that scope comments be submitted by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time \n(ET) on June 3, 2025, which is 20 calendar days from the signature date \nof this notice. Any rebuttal comments, which may include factual \ninformation, and should also be limited to public information, must be \nfiled by 5:00 p.m. ET on June 13, 2025, which is 10 calendar days from \nthe initial comment deadline.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties, Final Rule, \n62 FR 27296, 27323 (May 19, 1997) (Preamble); see also 19 CFR \n351.312.\n    \\8\\ See 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) (defining ``factual \ninformation'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Commerce requests that any factual information that parties \nconsider relevant to the scope of these investigations be submitted \nduring that period. However, if a party subsequently finds that \nadditional factual information pertaining to the scope of the \ninvestigations may be relevant, the party must contact Commerce and \nrequest permission to submit the additional information. All scope \ncomments must be filed simultaneously on the records of the concurrent \nLTFV and CVD investigations.\n\nFiling Requirements\n\n    All submissions to Commerce must be filed electronically via \nEnforcement and Compliance's Antidumping Duty and Countervailing Duty \nCentralized Electronic Service System (ACCESS),\n\n[[Page 21742]]\n\nunless an exception applies.\\9\\ An electronically filed document must \nbe received successfully in its entirety by the time and date it is \ndue.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ See Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings: \nElectronic Filing Procedures; Administrative Protective Order \nProcedures, 76 FR 39263 (July 6, 2011); see also Enforcement and \nCompliance: Change of Electronic Filing System Name, 79 FR 69046 \n(November 20, 2014) for details of Commerce's electronic filing \nrequirements, effective August 5, 2011. Information on using ACCESS \ncan be found at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov/help.aspx\">https://access.trade.gov/help.aspx</a> and a handbook \ncan be found at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov/help/Handbook_on_Electronic_Filing_Procedures.pdf\">https://access.trade.gov/help/Handbook_on_Electronic_Filing_Procedures.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComments on Product Characteristics\n\n    Commerce is providing interested parties an opportunity to comment \non the appropriate physical characteristics of silicon metal to be \nreported in response to Commerce's AD questionnaires. This information \nwill be used to identify the key physical characteristics of the \nsubject merchandise in order to report the relevant factors of \nproduction (FOP) or cost of production (COP) accurately, as well as to \ndevelop appropriate product comparison criteria.\n    Interested parties may provide any information or comments that \nthey feel are relevant to the development of an accurate list of \nphysical characteristics. Specifically, they may provide comments as to \nwhich characteristics are appropriate to use as: (1) general product \ncharacteristics; and (2) product comparison criteria. We note that it \nis not always appropriate to use all product characteristics as product \ncomparison criteria. We base product comparison criteria on meaningful \ncommercial differences among products. In other words, although there \nmay be some physical product characteristics utilized by manufacturers \nto describe silicon metal, it may be that only a select few product \ncharacteristics take into account commercially meaningful physical \ncharacteristics. In addition, interested parties may comment on the \norder in which the physical characteristics should be used in matching \nproducts. Generally, Commerce attempts to list the most important \nphysical characteristics first and the least important characteristics \nlast.\n    In order to consider the suggestions of interested parties in \ndeveloping and issuing the AD questionnaires, all product \ncharacteristics comments must be filed by 5:00 p.m. ET on June 3, 2025, \nwhich is 20 calendar days from the signature date of this notice. Any \nrebuttal comments must be filed by 5:00 p.m. ET on June 13, 2025, which \nis 10 calendar days from the initial comment deadline. All comments and \nsubmissions to Commerce must be filed electronically using ACCESS, as \nexplained above, on the record of the each of the LTFV investigations.\n\nDetermination of Industry Support for the Petitions\n\n    Section 732(b)(1) of the Act requires that a petition be filed on \nbehalf of the domestic industry. Section 732(c)(4)(A) of the Act \nprovides that a petition meets this requirement if the domestic \nproducers or workers who support the petition account for: (i) at least \n25 percent of the total production of the domestic like product; and \n(ii) more than 50 percent of the production of the domestic like \nproduct produced by that portion of the industry expressing support \nfor, or opposition to, the petition. Moreover, section 732(c)(4)(D) of \nthe Act provides that, if the petition does not establish support of \ndomestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of \nthe total production of the domestic like product, Commerce shall: (i) \npoll the industry or rely on other information in order to determine if \nthere is support for the petition, as required by subparagraph (A); or \n(ii) determine industry support using a statistically valid sampling \nmethod to poll the ``industry.''\n    Section 771(4)(A) of the Act defines the ``industry'' as the \nproducers as a whole of a domestic like product. Thus, to determine \nwhether a petition has the requisite industry support, the statute \ndirects Commerce to look to producers and workers who produce the \ndomestic like product. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), \nwhich is responsible for determining whether ``the domestic industry'' \nhas been injured, must also determine what constitutes a domestic like \nproduct in order to define the industry. While both Commerce and the \nITC must apply the same statutory definition regarding the domestic \nlike product,\\10\\ they do so for different purposes and pursuant to a \nseparate and distinct authority. In addition, Commerce's determination \nis subject to limitations of time and information. Although this may \nresult in different definitions of the like product, such differences \ndo not render the decision of either agency contrary to law.\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See section 771(10) of the Act.\n    \\11\\ See USEC, Inc. v. United States, 132 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (CIT \n2001) (citing Algoma Steel Corp., Ltd. v. United States, 688 F. \nSupp. 639, 644 (CIT 1988), aff'd 865 F.2d 240 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 771(10) of the Act defines the domestic like product as ``a \nproduct which is like, or in the absence of like, most similar in \ncharacteristics and uses with, the article subject to an investigation \nunder this title.'' Thus, the reference point from which the domestic \nlike product analysis begins is ``the article subject to an \ninvestigation'' (i.e., the class or kind of merchandise to be \ninvestigated, which normally will be the scope as defined in the \npetition).\n    With regard to the domestic like product, the petitioners do not \noffer a definition of the domestic like product distinct from the scope \nof the investigations.\\12\\ Based on our analysis of the information \nsubmitted on the record, we have determined that silicon metal, as \ndefined in the scope, constitutes a single domestic like product, and \nwe have analyzed industry support in terms of that domestic like \nproduct.\\13\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See Petitions at Volume I (pages 16-19 and Exhibits I-1, \nand I-9 through I-12).\n    \\13\\ For a discussion of the domestic like product analysis as \napplied to these cases and information regarding industry support, \nsee Checklists, ``Antidumping Duty Investigation Initiation \nChecklists: Silicon Metal from Angola, Australia, the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic, and Norway,'' dated concurrently with, and \nhereby adopted by, this notice (Country-Specific AD Initiation \nChecklists), at Attachment II, Analysis of Industry Support for the \nAntidumping and Countervailing Duty Petitions Covering Silicon Metal \nfrom Angola, Australia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, \nNorway, and Thailand (Attachment II). These checklists are on file \nelectronically via ACCESS.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In determining whether the petitioners have standing under section \n732(c)(4)(A) of the Act, we considered the industry support data \ncontained in the Petitions with reference to the domestic like product \nas defined in the ``Scope of the Investigations,'' in the appendix to \nthis notice. To establish industry support, the petitioners provided \ntheir own production of the domestic like product in 2024.\\14\\ The \npetitioners identified themselves as the only two producers of silicon \nmetal in the United States; therefore, the Petitions are supported by \n100 percent of the U.S. industry.\\15\\ We relied on data provided by the \npetitioners for purposes of measuring industry support.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ For further discussion, see Attachment II of the Country-\nSpecific AD Initiation Checklists.\n    \\15\\ Id.\n    \\16\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Our review of the data provided in the Petitions, the First General \nIssues Supplement, Second General Issues Supplement, and other \ninformation readily available to Commerce indicates that the \npetitioners have established industry support for the Petitions.\\17\\ \nFirst, the Petitions established support from domestic producers (or \nworkers) accounting for more than 50 percent of the total production of \nthe domestic like\n\n[[Page 21743]]\n\nproduct and, as such, Commerce is not required to take further action \nin order to evaluate industry support (e.g., polling).\\18\\ Second, the \ndomestic producers (or workers) have met the statutory criteria for \nindustry support under section 732(c)(4)(A)(i) of the Act because the \ndomestic producers (or workers) who support the Petitions account for \nat least 25 percent of the total production of the domestic like \nproduct.\\19\\ Finally, the domestic producers (or workers) have met the \nstatutory criteria for industry support under section 732(c)(4)(A)(ii) \nof the Act because the domestic producers (or workers) who support the \nPetitions account for more than 50 percent of the production of the \ndomestic like product produced by that portion of the industry \nexpressing support for, or opposition to, the Petitions.\\20\\ \nAccordingly, Commerce determines that the Petitions were filed on \nbehalf of the domestic industry within the meaning of section 732(b)(1) \nof the Act.\\21\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ Id.\n    \\18\\ Id.; see also section 732(c)(4)(D) of the Act.\n    \\19\\ See Attachment II of the Country-Specific AD Initiation \nChecklists.\n    \\20\\ Id.\n    \\21\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAllegations and Evidence of Material Injury and Causation\n\n    The petitioners allege that the U.S. industry producing the \ndomestic like product is being materially injured, or is threatened \nwith material injury, by reason of the imports of the subject \nmerchandise sold at LTFV. In addition, the petitioners allege that \nsubject imports from Australia, Laos, and Norway exceed the \nnegligibility threshold provided for under section 771(24)(A) of the \nAct.\\22\\ With respect to Angola, while the allegedly dumped imports do \nnot exceed the statutory requirements for negligibility,\\23\\ the \npetitioners allege and provide supporting evidence that there is the \npotential that imports from Angola will imminently exceed the \nnegligibility threshold and, therefore, are not negligible for purposes \nof a threat determination.\\24\\ The petitioners' arguments regarding the \npotential for imports to imminently exceed the negligibility threshold \nare consistent with the statutory criteria for ``negligibility in \nthreat analysis'' under section 771(24)(A)(iv) of the Act, which \nprovides that imports shall not be treated as negligible if there is a \npotential that subject imports from a country will imminently exceed \nthe statutory requirements for negligibility.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ For further discussion, see Country-Specific AD Initiation \nChecklists at Attachment III, Analysis of Allegations and Evidence \nof Material Injury and Causation for the Antidumping and \nCountervailing Duty Petitions Covering Silicon Metal from Angola, \nAustralia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Norway, and \nThailand (Attachment III).\n    \\23\\ Id.\n    \\24\\ Id.; see also section 771(24)(A)(iv) of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The petitioners contend that the industry's injured condition is \nillustrated by the significant increase in the volume of subject \nimports; reduced market share; underselling and price depression and/or \nsuppression; lost sales and revenues; and adverse impact on financial \nperformance.\\25\\ We assessed the allegations and supporting evidence \nregarding material injury, threat of material injury, causation, \ncumulation, as well as negligibility, and we have determined that these \nallegations are properly supported by adequate evidence, and meet the \nstatutory requirements for initiation.\\26\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\25\\ See Attachment III of the Country-Specific AD Initiation \nChecklists.\n    \\26\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAllegations of Sales at LTFV\n\n    The following is a description of the allegations of sales at LTFV \nupon which Commerce based its decision to initiate LTFV investigations \nof imports of silicon metal from Angola, Australia, Laos, and Norway. \nThe sources of data for the deductions and adjustments relating to U.S. \nprice and normal value (NV) are discussed in greater detail in the \nCountry-Specific AD Initiation Checklists.\n\nU.S. Price\n\n    For all countries, the petitioners based export price (EP) on the \nPOI average unit values (AUVs) derived from official import statistics \nfor imports of silicon metal from each country.\\27\\ For each country, \nthe petitioners made certain adjustments to U.S. price to calculate a \nnet ex-factory U.S price, where applicable.\\28\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\27\\ See Country-Specific AD Initiation Checklists.\n    \\28\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNormal Value \\29\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ In accordance with section 773(b)(2) of the Act, for these \ninvestigations, Commerce will request information necessary to \ncalculate the constructed value (CV) and COP to determine whether \nthere are reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the \nforeign like product have been made at prices that represent less \nthan the COP of the product.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For Australia and Norway, the petitioners stated that they were \nunable to obtain home market or third-country pricing information for \nsilicon metal in Australia or Norway to use a basis for NV.\\30\\ \nTherefore, for Australia and Norway, the petitioners calculated NV \nbased on CV. For further discussion of CV, see the section ``Normal \nValue Based on Constructed Value.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ See Country-Specific AD Initiation Checklists.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For Angola and Laos, the petitioners provided NV calculations using \nboth the NME and market economy (ME) methodologies.\\31\\ Under the ME \nmethodology, for Angola and Laos, the petitioners stated that they were \nunable to obtain home market or third-country pricing information for \nsilicon metal in Angola or Laos to use a basis for ME NV.\\32\\ \nTherefore, under the ME methodology for Angola and Laos, the \npetitioners calculated ME NV based on CV.\\33\\ For further discussion of \nCV, see the section ``Normal Value Based on Constructed Value.'' Under \nthe NME methodology, the petitioners calculated the NME NV based on \nfactors of production (FOPs) valued in a surrogate market country \neconomy country in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act.\\34\\ The \npetitioners claim that India is an appropriate surrogate country for \nAngola and Laos because India is a market economy country that is at a \nlevel of economic development comparable to that of Angola and Laos and \nis a significant producer of comparable merchandise.\\35\\ The \npetitioners provided publicly available information from India to value \nall FOPs, where applicable.\\36\\ We relied on the petitioners' selection \nof India as a surrogate country for Angola and Laos to value FOPs for \ninitiation purposes under the NME methodology.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\31\\ Id.\n    \\32\\ Id.\n    \\33\\ Id.\n    \\34\\ Id.\n    \\35\\ Id.\n    \\36\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested parties will have the opportunity to submit comments \nregarding surrogate country selection and, pursuant to 19 CFR \n351.301(c)(3)(i), will be provided an opportunity to submit publicly \navailable information to value FOPs within 30 days before the scheduled \ndate of the preliminary determinations.\n\nFactors of Production\n\n    Because information regarding the volume of inputs consumed by \nAngolan and Lao producers/exporters was not reasonably available, under \nthe NME methodology, the petitioners used the production experience and \nproduct-specific consumption rates of a U.S. producer of silicon metal \nas a surrogate to value Angolan and Lao manufacturers' FOPs.\\37\\ \nAdditionally, for Angola and Laos, the petitioners calculated factory \noverhead, selling, general, and administrative expenses\n\n[[Page 21744]]\n\n(SG&A), and profit based on the experience of an Indian producer of \ncomparable merchandise.\\38\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\37\\ See Country-Specific AD Initiation Checklists.\n    \\38\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNormal Value Based on Constructed Value\n\n    As noted above for Australia and Norway, the petitioners stated \nthat they were unable to obtain home market or third-country prices for \nsilicon metal to use as a basis for NV. Therefore, for Australia and \nNorway, the petitioners calculated NV based on CV.\\39\\ Additionally, \nunder the ME methodology for Angola and Laos, the petitioners stated \nthey were also unable to obtain home market or third-country prices for \nsilicon metal to use as a basis for ME NV. Therefore, under the ME \nmethodology for Angola and Laos, the petitioners calculated ME NV based \non CV.\\40\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\39\\ Id.\n    \\40\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to section 773(e) of the Act, the petitioners calculated \nCV as the sum of the cost of manufacturing, SG&A expenses, financial \nexpenses, and profit.\\41\\ For Australia and Norway as well as for the \nME methodology for Angola and Laos, in calculating the cost of \nmanufacturing, the petitioners relied on the production experience and \ninput consumption rates of a U.S. producer of silicon metal, valued \nusing publicly available information applicable to Angola, Australia, \nLaos, and Norway.\\42\\ For calculating SG&A expenses, financial \nexpenses, and profit ratios, the petitioners relied on the 2023 \nfinancial statements of a producer of identical merchandise domiciled \nin Norway for Norway, and the 2023 financial statements of Ferroglobe \nUPLC, the parent company of Ferroglobe USA, for Angola, Australia, and \nLaos.\\43\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\41\\ Id.\n    \\42\\ Id.\n    \\43\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFair Value Comparisons\n\n    Based on the data provided by the petitioners, there is reason to \nbelieve that imports of silicon metal from Angola, Australia, Laos, and \nNorway are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at \nLTFV. Based on comparisons of EP to NV in accordance with sections 772 \nand 773 of the Act, the estimated dumping margins for silicon metal \nfrom Australia and Norway are 328.89 and 102.08 percent, \nrespectively.\\44\\ Under the ME methodology, the estimated dumping \nmargins for silicon metal from Angola and Laos are 68.45 and 94.44 \npercent, respectively, for purposes of initiation.\\45\\ In light of the \npetitioners' allegations in the Petitions that Angola and Laos are \nNMEs, under the NME methodology, the estimated dumping margins for \nsilicon metal from Angola and Laos are 207.28 and 231.63 percent, \nrespectively, for purposes of initiation.\\46\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\44\\ Id.\n    \\45\\ Id.\n    \\46\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInitiation of LTFV Investigations\n\n    Based upon the examination of the Petitions and supplemental \nresponses, we find that they meet the requirements of section 732 of \nthe Act. Therefore, we are initiating LTFV investigations to determine \nwhether imports of silicon metal from Angola, Australia, Laos, and \nNorway are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at \nLTFV. In accordance with section 733(b)(1)(A) of the Act and 19 CFR \n351.205(b)(1), unless postponed, we will make our preliminary \ndeterminations no later than 140 days after the date of these \ninitiations.\n\nRespondent Selection\n\nAngola and Norway\n\n    In the Petitions, the petitioners identified three companies in \nAngola and three companies in Norway as producers and/or exporters of \nsilicon metal.\\47\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\47\\ See Petitions at Volume I (pages 10-11 and Exhibit I-6); \nsee also First General Issues Supplement at 4-5 and Attachments 1 \nand 2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Following standard practice in LTFV investigations involving market \neconomy countries, in the event Commerce determines that the number of \ncompanies is large, and it cannot individually examine each company \nbased upon Commerce's resource, where appropriate, Commerce intends to \nselect mandatory respondents based on U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection (CBP) data for imports under the appropriate Harmonized \nTariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheading(s) listed in \nthe ``Scope of the Investigations,'' in the appendix.\n    On May 12, 2025, Commerce released CBP data on imports of silicon \nmetal from Angola and Norway under administrative protective order \n(APO) to all parties with access to information protected by APO and \nindicated that interested parties wishing to comment on CBP data and/or \nrespondent selection must do so within three business days of the \npublication date of the notice of initiation of these \ninvestigations.\\48\\ Comments must be filed electronically using ACCESS. \nAn electronically filed document must be received successfully in its \nentirety via ACCESS by 5:00 p.m. ET on the specified deadline. Commerce \nwill not accept rebuttal comments regarding the CBP data or respondent \nselection.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\48\\ See Country-Specific Memoranda, ``Release of U.S. Customs \nand Border Protection Entry Data,'' dated May 12, 2025.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Interested parties must submit applications for disclosure under \nAPO in accordance with 19 CFR 351.305(b). Instructions for filing such \napplications may be found on Commerce's website at <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/administrative-protective-orders\">https://www.trade.gov/administrative-protective-orders</a>.\n\nAustralia and Laos\n\n    In the Petitions, the petitioners identified one company in \nAustralia (i.e., Simcoa Operations (Silicon Metal Company of \nAustralia)) and one company in Laos (i.e., Lao Silicon Co., Ltd.) as \nproducers and/or exporters of silicon metal and provided independent \nthird-party information as support.\\49\\ We currently know of no \nadditional producers/exporters of silicon metal from Australia and \nLaos.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\49\\ See Petitions at Volume I (pages 10-11 and Exhibit 6); see \nalso First General Issues Supplement at 3 and Attachment 1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Accordingly, Commerce intends to individually examine all known \nproducers/exporters in the investigations from Australia and Laos \n(i.e., the companies mentioned above). We invite interested parties to \ncomment on this issue. Such comments may include factual information \nwithin the meaning of 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21). Parties wishing to comment \nmust do so within three business days of the publication of this notice \nin the Federal Register. Comments must be filed electronically using \nACCESS. An electronically filed document must be received successfully \nin its entirety via ACCESS by 5:00 p.m. ET on the specified deadline. \nBecause we intend to examine all known producers/exporters in Australia \nand Laos, if no comments are received, or if comments received further \nsupport the existence of only these producers/exporters, we do not \nintend to conduct respondent selection and will proceed to issuing the \ninitial AD questionnaires to the companies identified. However, if \ncomments are received which create a need for a respondent selection \nprocess, we intend to finalize our decision regarding respondent \nselection for Australia and Laos within 20 days of publication of this \nnotice.\n\nSeparate Rates\n\n    Upon applying an NME methodology for Angola and Laos, Commerce will \nconsider assigning separate rates to exporters and producers. In order \nto\n\n[[Page 21745]]\n\nobtain separate rate status in an NME investigation, exporters and \nproducers must submit a separate rate application. The specific \nrequirements for submitting a separate rate application in an NME \ninvestigation are outlined in detail in the application itself, which \nis available on Commerce's website at <a href=\"https://access.trade.gov/Resources/nme/nme-sep-rate.html\">https://access.trade.gov/Resources/nme/nme-sep-rate.html</a>. Note that Commerce recently \npromulgated new regulations pertaining to separate rates, including the \nseparate rate application deadline and eligibility for separate rate \nstatus, in 19 CFR 351.108.\\50\\ Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.108(d)(1), the \nseparate rate application will be due 21 days after publication of this \ninitiation notice.\\51\\ Exporters and producers must file a timely \nseparate rate application if they want to be considered for individual \nexamination. In addition, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.108(e), exporters and \nproducers who submit a separate rate application and have been selected \nas mandatory respondents will be eligible for consideration for \nseparate rate status only if they fully respond to all parts of \nCommerce's AD questionnaire and participate in the LTFV proceeding as \nmandatory respondents.\\52\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\50\\ See Regulations Enhancing the Administration of the \nAntidumping and Countervailing Duty Trade Remedy Laws, 89 FR 101694, \n101759-60 (December 16, 2024).\n    \\51\\ See 19 CFR 351.108(d)(1).\n    \\52\\ See 19 CFR 351.108(e).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse of Combination Rates\n\n    Upon applying an NME methodology, Commerce will calculate \ncombination rates for certain respondents that are eligible for a \nseparate rate in an NME investigation. The Separate Rates and \nCombination Rates Bulletin states:\n\n{w{time} hile continuing the practice of assigning separate rates \nonly to exporters, all separate rates that {Commerce{time}  will now \nassign in its NME investigation will be specific to those producers \nthat supplied the exporter during the period of investigation. Note, \nhowever, that one rate is calculated for the exporter and all of the \nproducers which supplied subject merchandise to it during the period \nof investigation. This practice applies both to mandatory \nrespondents receiving an individually calculated separate rate as \nwell as the pool of non-investigated firms receiving the {weighted \naverage{time}  of the individually calculated rates. This practice \nis referred to as the application of ``combination rates'' because \nsuch rates apply to specific combinations of exporters and one or \nmore producers. The cash-deposit rate assigned to an exporter will \napply only to merchandise both exported by the firm in question and \nproduced by a firm that supplied the exporter during the period of \ninvestigation.\\53\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\53\\ See Enforcement and Compliance's Policy Bulletin No. 05.1, \nregarding, ``Separate-Rates Practice and Application of Combination \nRates in Antidumping Investigation involving NME Countries,'' (April \n5, 2005), at 6 (emphasis added), available on Commerce's website at \n<a href=\"https://access.trade.gov/Resources/policy/bull05-1.pdf\">https://access.trade.gov/Resources/policy/bull05-1.pdf</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDistribution of Copies of the Petitions\n\n    In accordance with section 732(b)(3)(A) of the Act and 19 CFR \n351.202(f), a copy of the public version of the Petitions has been \nprovided to the governments of Angola, Australia, Laos, and Norway via \nACCESS. To the extent practicable, we will attempt to provide a copy of \nthe public version of the Petitions to each exporter named in the \nPetitions, as provided under 19 CFR 351.203(c)(2).\n\nITC Notification\n\n    Commerce will notify the ITC of our initiation, as required by \nsection 732(d) of the Act.\n\nPreliminary Determinations by the ITC\n\n    The ITC will preliminarily determine, within 45 days after the date \non which the Petitions were filed, whether there is a reasonable \nindication that imports of silicon metal from Angola, Australia, Laos, \nand Norway are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, \na U.S. industry.\\54\\ A negative ITC determination for any country will \nresult in the investigation being terminated with respect to that \ncountry.\\55\\ Otherwise, these LTFV investigations will proceed \naccording to statutory and regulatory time limits.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\54\\ See section 733(a) of the Act.\n    \\55\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubmission of Factual Information\n\n    Factual information is defined in 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) as: (i) \nevidence submitted in response to questionnaires; (ii) evidence \nsubmitted in support of allegations; (iii) publicly available \ninformation to value factors under 19 CFR 351.408(c) or to measure the \nadequacy of remuneration under 19 CFR 351.511(a)(2); (iv) evidence \nplaced on the record by Commerce; and (v) evidence other than factual \ninformation described in (i)-(iv). Section 351.301(b) of Commerce's \nregulations requires any party, when submitting factual information, to \nspecify under which subsection of 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) the information \nis being submitted \\56\\ and, if the information is submitted to rebut, \nclarify, or correct factual information already on the record, to \nprovide an explanation identifying the information already on the \nrecord that the factual information seeks to rebut, clarify, or \ncorrect.\\57\\ Time limits for the submission of factual information are \naddressed in 19 CFR 351.301, which provides specific time limits based \non the type of factual information being submitted. Interested parties \nshould review the regulations prior to submitting factual information \nin these investigations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\56\\ See 19 CFR 351.301(b).\n    \\57\\ See 19 CFR 351.301(b)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticular Market Situation Allegation\n\n    Section 773(e) of the Act addresses the concept of particular \nmarket situation (PMS) for purposes of CV, stating that ``if a \nparticular market situation exists such that the cost of materials and \nfabrication or other processing of any kind does not accurately reflect \nthe cost of production in the ordinary course of trade, the \nadministering authority may use another calculation methodology under \nthis subtitle or any other calculation methodology.'' When an \ninterested party submits a PMS allegation pursuant to section 773(e) of \nthe Act (i.e., a cost-based PMS allegation), the submission must be \nfiled in accordance with the requirements of 19 CFR 351.416(b), and \nCommerce will respond to such a submission consistent with 19 CFR \n351.301(c)(2)(v). If Commerce finds that a cost-based PMS exists under \nsection 773(e) of the Act, then it will modify its dumping calculations \nappropriately.\n    Neither section 773(e) of the Act, nor 19 CFR 351.301(c)(2)(v), \nsets a deadline for the submission of cost-based PMS allegations and \nsupporting factual information. However, in order to administer section \n773(e) of the Act, Commerce must receive PMS allegations and supporting \nfactual information with enough time to consider the submission. Thus, \nshould an interested party wish to submit a cost-based PMS allegation \nand supporting new factual information pursuant to section 773(e) of \nthe Act, it must do so no later than 20 days after submission of a \nrespondent's initial section D questionnaire response.\n    We note that a PMS allegation filed pursuant to sections \n773(a)(1)(B)(ii)(III) or 773(a)(1)(C)(iii) of the Act (i.e., a sales-\nbased PMS allegation) must be filed within 10 days of submission of a \nrespondent's initial section B questionnaire response, in accordance \nwith 19 CFR 351.301(c)(2)(i) and 19 CFR 351.404(c)(2).\n\nExtensions of Time Limits\n\n    Parties may request an extension of time limits before the \nexpiration of a time limit established under 19 CFR 351.301, or as \notherwise specified by Commerce. In general, an extension request will \nbe considered untimely if it is filed after the expiration of the time \nlimit established under 19 CFR 351.301, or as otherwise specified by\n\n[[Page 21746]]\n\nCommerce.\\58\\ For submissions that are due from multiple parties \nsimultaneously, an extension request will be considered untimely if it \nis filed after 10:00 a.m. ET on the due date. Under certain \ncircumstances, Commerce may elect to specify a different time limit by \nwhich extension requests will be considered untimely for submissions \nwhich are due from multiple parties simultaneously. In such a case, we \nwill inform parties in a letter or memorandum of the deadline \n(including a specified time) by which extension requests must be filed \nto be considered timely. An extension request must be made in a \nseparate, standalone submission; under limited circumstances we will \ngrant untimely filed requests for the extension of time limits, where \nwe determine, based on 19 CFR 351.302, that extraordinary circumstances \nexist. Parties should review Commerce's regulations concerning the \nextension of time limits and the Time Limits Final Rule prior to \nsubmitting factual information in these investigations.\\59\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\58\\ See 19 CFR 351.301; see also Extension of Time Limits; \nFinal Rule, 78 FR 57790 (September 20, 2013) (Time Limits Final \nRule), available at <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-09-20/html/2013-22853.htm\">https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-09-20/html/2013-22853.htm</a>.\n    \\59\\ See 19 CFR 351.302; see also, e.g., Time Limits Final Rule.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCertification Requirements\n\n    Any party submitting factual information in an AD or CVD proceeding \nmust certify to the accuracy and completeness of that information.\\60\\ \nParties must use the certification formats provided in 19 CFR \n351.303(g).\\61\\ Commerce intends to reject factual submissions if the \nsubmitting party does not comply with the applicable certification \nrequirements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\60\\ See section 782(b) of the Act.\n    \\61\\ See Certification of Factual Information to Import \nAdministration During Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \nProceedings, 78 FR 42678 (July 17, 2013) (Final Rule).

Consistent with section \n702(b)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.202(b), for those alleged programs \non which we are initiating CVD investigations, the Petitions were \naccompanied by information reasonably available to the petitioners \nsupporting their allegations.\n    Commerce finds that the petitioners filed the Petitions on behalf \nof the domestic industry, because the petitioners are interested \nparties, as\n\n[[Page 21747]]\n\ndefined in section 771(9)(C) of the Act. Commerce also finds that the \npetitioners demonstrated sufficient industry support with respect to \nthe initiation of the requested CVD investigations.\\5\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ See section on ``Determination of Industry Support for the \nPetitions,'' infra.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPeriods of Investigation\n\n    Because the Petitions were filed on April 24, 2025, the period of \ninvestigation for the Australia, Laos, Norway, and Thailand CVD \ninvestigations is January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ See 19 CFR 351.204(b)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScope of the Investigations\n\n    The product covered by these investigations is silicon metal from \nAustralia, Laos, Norway, and Thailand. For a full description of the \nscope of these investigations, see the appendix to this notice.\n\nComments on the Scope of the Investigations\n\n    As discussed in the Preamble to Commerce's regulations, we are \nsetting aside a period for interested parties to raise issues regarding \nproduct coverage (i.e., scope).\\7\\ Commerce will consider all comments \nreceived from interested parties and, if necessary, will consult with \ninterested parties prior to the issuance of the preliminary \ndeterminations. If scope comments include factual information, all such \nfactual information should be limited to public information.\\8\\ \nCommerce requests that interested parties provide at the beginning of \ntheir scope comments a public executive summary for each comment or \nissue raised in their submission. Commerce further requests that \ninterested parties limit their public executive summary of each comment \nor issue to no more than 450 words, not including citations. Commerce \nintends to use the public executive summaries as the basis of the \ncomment summaries included in the analysis of scope comments. To \nfacilitate preparation of its questionnaires, Commerce requests that \nscope comments be submitted by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on June 3, \n2025, which is 20 calendar days from the signature date of this notice. \nAny rebuttal comments, which may include factual information, and \nshould also be limited to public information, must be filed by 5:00 \np.m. ET on June 13, 2025, which is 10 calendar days from the initial \ncomment deadline.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties; Final Rule, \n62 FR 27296, 27323 (May 19, 1997) (Preamble).\n    \\8\\ See 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) (defining ``factual \ninformation'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Commerce requests that any factual information that parties \nconsider relevant to the scope of these investigations be submitted \nduring that time period. However, if a party subsequently finds that \nadditional factual information pertaining to the scope of the \ninvestigations may be relevant, the party must contact Commerce and \nrequest permission to submit the additional information. All scope \ncomments must be filed simultaneously on the records of the concurrent \nAD and CVD investigations.\n\nFiling Requirements\n\n    All submissions to Commerce must be filed electronically via \nEnforcement and Compliance's Antidumping Duty and Countervailing Duty \nCentralized Electronic Service System (ACCESS), unless an exception \napplies.\\9\\ An electronically filed document must be received \nsuccessfully in its entirety by the time and date it is due.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ See Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings: \nElectronic Filing Procedures; Administrative Protective Order \nProcedures, 76 FR 39263 (July 6, 2011); see also Enforcement and \nCompliance; Change of Electronic Filing System Name, 79 FR 69046 \n(November 20, 2014), for details of Commerce's electronic filing \nrequirements, effective August 5, 2011.

Section 702(c)(4)(A) of the Act \nprovides that a petition meets this requirement if the domestic \nproducers or workers who support the petition account for: (i) at least \n25 percent of the total production of the domestic like product; and \n(ii) more than 50 percent of the production of the domestic like \nproduct produced by that portion of the industry expressing support \nfor, or opposition to, the petition. Moreover, section 702(c)(4)(D) of \nthe Act provides that, if the petition does not establish support of \ndomestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of \nthe total production of the domestic like product, Commerce shall: (i) \npoll the industry or rely on other information in order to determine if \nthere is support for the petition, as required by subparagraph (A); or \n(ii) determine industry support using a statistically valid sampling \nmethod to poll the ``industry.''\n    Section 771(4)(A) of the Act defines the ``industry'' as the \nproducers as a whole of a domestic like product. Thus, to determine \nwhether a petition has the requisite industry support, the statute \ndirects Commerce to look to producers and workers who produce the \ndomestic like product. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), \nwhich is responsible for determining whether ``the domestic industry'' \nhas been injured, must also determine what constitutes a domestic like \nproduct in order to define the industry. While both Commerce and the \nITC apply the same statutory definition regarding the domestic like \nproduct,\\14\\ they do so for different purposes and pursuant to a \nseparate and distinct authority. In addition, Commerce's determination \nis subject to limitations of time and information. Although this may \nresult in different definitions of the like product, such differences \ndo not render the decision of either agency contrary to law.\\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ See section 771(10) of the Act.\n    \\15\\ See USEC, Inc. v. United States, 132 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (CIT \n2001) (citing Algoma Steel Corp., Ltd. v. United States, 688 F. \nSupp. 639, 644 (CIT 1988), aff'd Algoma Steel Corp., Ltd. v. United \nStates, 865 F.2d 240 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Section 771(10) of the Act defines the domestic like product as ``a \nproduct which is like, or in the absence of like, most similar in \ncharacteristics and uses with, the article subject to an investigation \nunder this title.'' Thus, the reference point from which the domestic \nlike product analysis begins is ``the article subject to an \ninvestigation'' (i.e., the class or kind of merchandise to be \ninvestigated, which normally will be the scope as defined in the \npetition).\n    With regard to the domestic like product, the petitioners do not \noffer a\n\n[[Page 21748]]\n\ndefinition of the domestic like product distinct from the scope of the \ninvestigations.\\16\\ Based on our analysis of the information submitted \non the record, we have determined that silicon metal, as defined in the \nscope, constitutes a single domestic like product, and we have analyzed \nindustry support in terms of that domestic like product.\\17\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ See Petitions at Volume I (pages 16-19 and Exhibits I-1, \nand I-9 through I-20).\n    \\17\\ For a discussion of the domestic like product analysis as \napplied to these cases and information regarding industry support, \nsee Checklists, ``Countervailing Duty Investigation Initiation \nChecklists: Silicon Metal from Australia, the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic, Norway, and Thailand,'' dated concurrently \nwith, and hereby adopted by, this notice (Country-Specific CVD \nInitiation Checklists), at Attachment II, Analysis of Industry \nSupport for the Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Petitions \nCovering Silicon Metal from Angola, Australia, Laos, Norway, and \nThailand (Attachment II). These checklists are on file \nelectronically via ACCESS.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In determining whether the petitioners have standing under section \n702(c)(4)(A) of the Act, we considered the industry support data \ncontained in the Petitions with reference to the domestic like product \nas defined in the ``Scope of the Investigations,'' in the appendix to \nthis notice. To establish industry support, the petitioners provided \ntheir own production of the domestic like product in 2024.\\18\\ The \npetitioners identified themselves as the only two producers of silicon \nmetal in the United States; therefore, the Petitions are supported by \n100 percent of the U.S. industry.\\19\\ We relied on data provided by the \npetitioners for purposes of measuring industry support.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ Id.\n    \\19\\ Id.\n    \\20\\ For further discussion, see Attachment II of the Country-\nSpecific CVD Initiation Checklists.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Our review of the data provided in the Petitions, the First General \nIssues Supplement, Second General Issues Supplement, and other \ninformation readily available to Commerce indicates that the \npetitioners have established industry support for the Petitions.\\21\\ \nFirst, the Petitions established support from domestic producers (or \nworkers) accounting for more than 50 percent of the total production of \nthe domestic like product and, as such, Commerce is not required to \ntake further action in order to evaluate industry support (e.g., \npolling).\\22\\ Second, the domestic producers (or workers) have met the \nstatutory criteria for industry support under section 702(c)(4)(A)(i) \nof the Act because the domestic producers (or workers) who support the \nPetitions account for at least 25 percent of the total production of \nthe domestic like product.\\23\\ Finally, the domestic producers (or \nworkers) have met the statutory criteria for industry support under \nsection 702(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act because the domestic producers (or \nworkers) who support the Petitions account for more than 50 percent of \nthe production of the domestic like product produced by that portion of \nthe industry expressing support for, or opposition to, the \nPetitions.\\24\\ Accordingly, Commerce determines that the Petitions were \nfiled on behalf of the domestic industry within the meaning of section \n702(b)(1) of the Act.\\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ Id.\n    \\22\\ Id.; see also section 702(c)(4)(D) of the Act.\n    \\23\\ See Attachment II of the Country-Specific CVD Initiation \nChecklists.\n    \\24\\ Id.\n    \\25\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInjury Test\n\n    Because Australia, Laos, Norway, and Thailand are ``Subsidies \nAgreement Countries'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, \nsection 701(a)(2) of the Act applies to these investigations. \nAccordingly, the ITC must determine whether imports of the subject \nmerchandise from Australia, Laos, Norway, and/or Thailand materially \ninjure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.\n\nAllegations and Evidence of Material Injury and Causation\n\n    The petitioners allege that imports of the subject merchandise are \nbenefiting from countervailable subsidies and that such imports are \ncausing, or threaten to cause, material injury to the U.S. industry \nproducing the domestic like product. In addition, the petitioners \nallege that subject imports from Australia, Laos, and Norway exceed the \nnegligibility threshold provided for under section 771(24)(A) of the \nAct.\\26\\ Further, in the instance of a CVD petition, section 771(24)(B) \nof the Act provides that imports of subject merchandise from developing \nand least developed countries must exceed the negligibility threshold \nof four percent. The petitioner also demonstrates that imports from \nLaos, which has been designated as a least developed country under \nsection 771(36)(B) of the Act, exceed the negligibility threshold of \nfour percent.\\27\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\26\\ For further information regarding negligibility and the \ninjury allegation, see Country-Specific CVD Initiation Checklists at \nAttachment III, Analysis of Allegations and Evidence of Material \nInjury and Causation for the Antidumping Duty and Countervailing \nDuty Petitions Covering Silicon Metal from Angola, Australia, the \nLao People's Democratic Republic, Norway, and Thailand (Attachment \nIII).\n    \\27\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    With respect to Thailand, while the allegedly subsidized imports do \nnot exceed the statutory requirements for negligibility,\\28\\ the \npetitioners allege and provide supporting evidence that there is the \npotential that imports from Thailand will imminently exceed the \nnegligibility threshold and, therefore, are not negligible for purposes \nof a threat determination.\\29\\ The petitioners' arguments regarding the \npotential for imports to imminently exceed the negligibility threshold \nare consistent with the statutory criteria for ``negligibility in \nthreat analysis'' under section 771(24)(A)(iv) of the Act, which \nprovides that imports shall not be treated as negligible if there is a \npotential that subject imports from a country will imminently exceed \nthe statutory requirements for negligibility.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ Id.\n    \\29\\ Id.; see also section 771(24)(A)(iv) of the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The petitioners contend that the industry's injured condition is \nillustrated by the significant increase in the volume of subject \nimports; reduced market share; underselling and price depression and/or \nsuppression; lost sales and revenues; and adverse impact on financial \nperformance.\\30\\ We assessed the allegations and supporting evidence \nregarding material injury, threat of material injury, causation, \ncumulation, as well as negligibility, and we have determined that these \nallegations are properly supported by adequate evidence and meet the \nstatutory requirements for initiation.\\31\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\30\\ See Attachment III of the Country-Specific CVD Initiation \nChecklists.\n    \\31\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInitiation of CVD Investigations\n\n    Based upon the examination of the Petitions and supplemental \nresponses, we find that they meet the requirements of section 702 of \nthe Act. Therefore, we are initiating CVD investigations to determine \nwhether imports of silicon metal from Australia, Laos, Norway, and \nThailand benefit from countervailable subsidies conferred by the GOA, \nGOL, GON, and GOT, respectively. In accordance with section 703(b)(1) \nof the Act and 19 CFR 351.205(b)(1), unless postponed, we will make our \npreliminary determinations no later than 65 days after the date of this \ninitiation.\n\nAustralia\n\n    Based on our review of the Petitions, we find that there is \nsufficient information to initiate a CVD investigation on nine of the \nnine programs alleged by the petitioners. For a full discussion of the \nbasis for our\n\n[[Page 21749]]\n\ndecision to initiate on each program, see the Australia CVD Initiation \nChecklist. A public version of the initiation checklist for this \ninvestigation is available on ACCESS.\n\nLaos\n\n    Based on our review of the Petitions, we find that there is \nsufficient information to initiate a CVD investigation on 12 of the 14 \nprograms alleged by the petitioners. For a full discussion of the basis \nfor our decision to initiate on each program, see the Laos CVD \nInitiation Checklist. A public version of the initiation checklist for \nthis investigation is available on ACCESS.\n\nNorway\n\n    Based on our review of the Petitions, we find that there is \nsufficient information to initiate a CVD investigation on 11 of the 11 \nprograms alleged by the petitioners. For a full discussion of the basis \nfor our decision to initiate on each program, see the Norway CVD \nInitiation Checklist. A public version of the initiation checklist for \nthis investigation is available on ACCESS.\n\nThailand\n\n    Based on our review of the Petitions, we find that there is \nsufficient information to initiate a CVD investigation on 16 of the 16 \nprograms alleged by the petitioners. For a full discussion of the basis \nfor our decision to initiate on each program, see the Thailand CVD \nInitiation Checklist. A public version of the initiation checklist for \nthis investigation is available on ACCESS.\n\nRespondent Selection\n\nAustralia, Laos, and Thailand\n\n    In the Petitions, the petitioners identified one company in \nAustralia (i.e., Simcoa Operations (Silicon Metal Company of \nAustralia)), one company in Laos (i.e., Lao Silicon Co., Ltd.), and two \ncompanies in Thailand (i.e., G.S. Energy Co., Ltd. and Sica New \nMaterials (Thailand) Co., Ltd.) as producers and/or exporters of \nsilicon metal and provided independent third-party information as \nsupport.\\32\\ We currently know of no additional producers/exporters of \nsilicon metal from Australia, Laos, or Thailand.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ See Petitions at Volume I (page 10-11 and Exhibit 6); see \nalso First General Issues Supplement at 3-4 and Attachment 1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Accordingly, Commerce intends to individually examine all known \nproducers/exporters in the investigations from Australia, Laos, and \nThailand (i.e., the companies mentioned above). We invite interested \nparties to comment on this issue. Such comments may include factual \ninformation within the meaning of 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21). Parties \nwishing to comment must do so within three business days of the \npublication of this notice in the Federal Register. Comments must be \nfiled electronically using ACCESS. An electronically filed document \nmust be received successfully in its entirety via ACCESS by 5:00 p.m. \nET on the specified deadline. Because we intend to examine all known \nproducers/exporters in Australia, Laos, and Thailand, if no comments \nare received, or if comments received further support the existence of \nonly these producers/exporters, we do not intend to conduct respondent \nselection and will proceed to issuing the initial CVD questionnaires to \nthe companies identified. However, if comments are received which \ncreate a need for a respondent selection process, we intend to finalize \nour decision regarding respondent selection for Australia, Laos, and \nThailand within 20 days of publication of this notice.\n\nNorway\n\n    In the Petitions, the petitioners identified three companies in \nNorway as producers and/or exporters of silicon metal.\\33\\ Commerce \nintends to follow its standard practice in CVD investigations and \ncalculate company-specific subsidy rates in the investigations. \nFollowing standard practice in CVD investigations, in the event \nCommerce determines that the number of companies is large, and it \ncannot individually examine each company based upon Commerce's \nresources, where appropriate, Commerce intends to select mandatory \nrespondents based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data for \nimports under the appropriate Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates (HTSUS) subheading(s) listed in the ``Scope of the \nInvestigations,'' in the appendix.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\33\\ See Petitions at Volume I (page 10-11 and Exhibit 6); see \nalso First General Issues Supplement at 4-5 and Attachments 1 and 2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    On May 12, 2025, Commerce released CBP data on imports of silicon \nmetal from Norway under administrative protective order (APO) to all \nparties with access to information protected by APO and indicated that \ninterested parties wishing to comment on CBP data and/or respondent \nselection must do so within three business days of the publication date \nof the notice of initiation of these investigations.\\34\\ Comments must \nbe filed electronically using ACCESS. An electronically filed document \nmust be received successfully in its entirety via ACCESS by 5:00 p.m. \nET on the specified deadline.

Also on April 3, 2025, Commerce notified all interested \nparties of its intent to rescind the administrative review because \nthere were no suspended entries of subject merchandise made by the one \ncompany subject to this administrative review, Filmag Italia, SpA, and \ninvited interested partes to comment.\\7\\ Commerce did not receive \ncomments from any interested parties on its notice of intent to rescind \nthe administrative review with respect to the sole remaining company \nsubject to this administrative review, Filmag Italia, SpA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ See Memorandum, ``Release of U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection Import Data,'' dated April 3, 2025.\n    \\7\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRescission of Review\n\n    Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.213(d)(1), Commerce will rescind an \nadministrative review, in whole or in part, if the parties that \nrequested a review withdraw the request within 90 days of the date of \npublication of the notice of initiation. Commerce received a request \nfrom the petitioner for an administrative review of: (1) Filmag Italia, \nSpA (Filmag) and (2) Tectubi Raccordi SpA (including its affiliates, \nRaccordi Forgiati S.r.l. and Allied International S.r.l.).\\8\\ The \npetitioner withdrew its request for review with respect to Tectubi \nRaccordi SpA (including its affiliates, Raccordi Forgiati S.r.l. and \nAllied International S.r.l.).\\9\\ Because the request for review was \ntimely withdrawn for Tectubi Raccordi SpA (including its affiliates, \nRaccordi Forgiati S.r.l. and Allied International S.r.l.), and because \nno other party requested a review of Tectubi Raccordi SpA (including \nits affiliates, Raccordi Forgiati S.r.l. and Allied International \nS.r.l.) in accordance with 19 CFR 351.213(d)(1), Commerce is rescinding \nthis review for Tectubi Raccordi SpA (including its affiliates, \nRaccordi Forgiati S.r.l. and Allied International S.r.l.).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ Id., 90 FR at 14081.\n    \\9\\ See Petitioner's Letter, ``Petitioner's Partial Withdrawal \nof Request for 2024/2025 Administrative Review,'' dated March 27, \n2025.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.213(d)(3), it is Commerce's \npractice to rescind an administrative review of an AD order when there \nare no entries of subject merchandise during the POR for which \nliquidation is suspended.\\10\\ Normally, upon completion of an \nadministrative review, the suspended entries are liquidated at the AD \nassessment rate calculated for the review period.\\11\\ Therefore, for an \nadministrative review to be conducted, there must be a suspended entry \nthat Commerce can instruct CBP to liquidate at the AD assessment rate \ncalculated for the review period.\\12\\ As noted above, there were no \nsuspended entries of subject merchandise for Filmag Italia, SpA subject \nto this review during the POR. Accordingly, in the absence of suspended \nentries of subject merchandise during the POR, we are hereby rescinding \nthis administrative review, in its entirety, in accordance with 19 CFR \n351.213(d)(3).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ See, e.g., Dioctyl Terephthalate from the Republic of \nKorea: Rescission of Antidumping Administrative Review; 2021-2022, \n88 FR 24758 (April 24, 2023); see also Certain Carbon and Alloy \nSteel Cut-to-Length Plate from the Federal Republic of Germany: \nRecission of Antidumping Administrative Review; 2020-2021, 88 FR \n4154 (January 24, 2023).\n    \\11\\ See 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1).\n    \\12\\ See 19 CFR 351.213(d)(3).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCash Deposit Requirements\n\n    As Commerce has proceeded to a final rescission of this \nadministrative review, no cash deposit rates will change. Accordingly, \nthe current cash deposit requirements shall remain in effect until \nfurther notice.\n\nAssessment\n\n    Commerce will instruct CBP to assess antidumping duties on all \nappropriate entries of stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings from \nItaly. ADs shall be assessed at rates equal to the cash deposit rate of \nestimated ADs required at the time of entry, or withdrawal from \nwarehouse, for consumption, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.212(c)(1)(i). \nCommerce intends to issue appropriate assessment instructions to CBP no \nearlier than 35 days after the date of publication of this rescission \nnotice in the Federal Register.\n\nAdministrative Protective Order (APO)\n\n    This notice serves as a final reminder to parties subject to an APO \nof their responsibility concerning the return or destruction of \nproprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR \n351.305(a)(3), which continues to govern business proprietary \ninformation in this segment of the proceeding.

Abstract\n\n    This request is for the revision and extension of OMB Control \nNumber: 0648-0335, sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration's (NOAA's) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) \nOffice of International Affairs, Trade, and Commerce (IATC). This \ncollection is being revised to transfer five (5) information \ncollections currently included under OMB Control Number: 0648-0387, \nwhich is sponsored by the NMFS West Coast Region (WCR), to Control \nNumber 0648-0335 to more accurately reflect how the information is \nactually being managed. All information collections referenced will be \nrenewed under 0648-0335 going forward. There are no substantive changes \nto the information collection under 0648-0335 or those being brought \nover from 0648-0387. The five collections of information from 0648-0387 \nwill be removed from that collection at the next renewal.\n    The information collected under 0648-0335, required by the \nInternational Dolphin Conservation Program Act (IDCPA), amendment to \nthe Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), is \nneeded to: (1) document the dolphin-safe status of tuna import \nshipments; (2) verify that import shipments of fish were not harvested \nby large-scale, high seas driftnets; and (3) verify that tuna was not \nharvested by an embargoed nation or one that is otherwise prohibited \nfrom exporting tuna to the United States. Collected information \nincludes the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Entry \nIdentification, date of entry, and contact details on the exporting and \nimporting companies. It also includes harvest characteristics such as \nfishing vessel name, fishing trip dates, vessel flag, vessel gear type, \nand ocean area of harvest, as well as the declaration of the dolphin \nsafe status of the shipment, and if applicable, the attachment of \nrequired certifications. Forms are submitted by importers and \nprocessors. NMFS uses this information to verify the dolphin-safe \nstatus of tuna shipments.\n    The five information collections from 0648-0387 being merged into \n0648-0335 are required by the IDCPA (16 U.S.C. 1414), which amended the \nDolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (DPCIA) (16 U.S.C. 1385). \nThe IDCPA and the DPCIA, inter alia, authorize the Secretary of \nCommerce to promulgate regulations that implement the dolphin-safe \nlabeling standard in the United States by the collection of documents \non the dolphin-safe status of tuna import shipments and domestic tuna \nproduct processing; by (1) allowing documentary requests to allow for \nan effective tracking and verification program; and (2) by verifying \nthat tuna was not harvested by a nation under embargo or otherwise \nprohibited from exporting tuna to the United States. This collection \nincludes vessel arrival notifications, tuna tracking forms, tuna \nproduct receiving and processing reports, and documents/certifications \nthat provide information on vessel characteristics and operations in \nthe ETP, the origin of tuna and tuna products, and chain of custody \nrecordkeeping requirements. At this time we would also like to revise \nthe IC Title from ``Fisheries Certificate of Origin'' to ``Tuna \nTracking and Verification Program''. As we make the necessary revisions \nto 0648-0335, it is imperative to amend the name to be more reflective \nof the broader information collections under our program and respected \nOMB control number.\n\nII. Method of Collection\n\n    For the existing information collection under OMB Control Number \n0648-0335, importing respondents are required to submit the form \nelectronically to the CBP before or at the time of importation via the \nAutomated Commercial Environment (ACE), as per regulations at 50 CFR \n216.24(f)(2). Domestic processors typically submit the forms monthly \nvia email, as per regulations at 50 CFR 216.93(d)(2).\n    There are no U.S. forms/templates for the information collections \nbeing brought over from OMB Control Number 0648-0387. The information \nwill be collected electronically through email or other secure \ntransmission platforms as appropriate. Implementing regulations are \nfound at 50 CFR 216.91 and 50 CFR 216.93.\n\nIII. Data\n\n    OMB Control Number: 0648-0335.\n    Form Number(s): NOAA Form 370.\n    Type of Review: Regular submission (Revision and extension of a \ncurrent information collection).\n    Affected Public: Business or other for-profit organizations.\n    Estimated Number of Respondents: 540.\n    Estimated Time per Response: Fisheries Certificate of Origin: 25 \nminutes; Vessel Arrival Notification and Monthly Tuna Storage Removal \nReport: 10 minutes each; Tuna Tracking Form and Monthly Tuna Receiving \nReports: 60 minutes each; Chain of Custody Report: 30 minutes.\n    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 5,993.\n    Estimated Total Annual Cost to Public: $0.\n    Respondent's Obligation: Mandatory.\n    Legal Authority: Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361 et \nseq.); the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (16 U.S.C. \n1385), and the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act (16 \nU.S.C. 1414).\n\nIV. Request for Comments\n\n    We are soliciting public comments to permit the Department/Bureau \nto: (a) Evaluate whether the proposed information collection is \nnecessary for the proper functions of the Department, including whether \nthe information will have practical utility; (b) Evaluate the accuracy \nof our estimate of the time and cost burden for this proposed \ncollection, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions \nused; (c) Evaluate ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of \nthe information to be collected; and (d) Minimize the reporting burden \non those who are to respond, including the use of automated collection \ntechniques or other forms of information technology.\n    Comments that you submit in response to this notice are a matter of \npublic record. We will include or summarize each comment in our request \nto OMB to approve this ICR. Before including your address, phone \nnumber, email address, or other personal identifying information in \nyour comment, you should be aware that your entire comment--including \nyour personal identifying information--may be made publicly available \nat any time. While you may ask us in your comment\n\n[[Page 21754]]\n\nto withhold your personal identifying information from public review, \nwe cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.\n\nSheleen Dumas,\nDepartmental PRA Compliance Officer, Office of the Under Secretary for \nEconomic Affairs, Commerce Department.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09084 Filed 5-20-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 3510-22-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

In case of problems accessing these \ndocuments, please call the contact listed below.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jenna Harlacher, Office of Protected \nResources, NMFS, (301) 427-8401.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \n\nMMPA Background and Determinations\n\n    The MMPA prohibits the ``take'' of marine mammals, with certain \nexceptions. Among the exceptions is section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA \n(16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) which directs the Secretary of Commerce (as \ndelegated to NMFS) to allow, upon request, the incidental, but not \nintentional, taking by harassment of small numbers of marine mammals by \nU.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial \nfishing) within a specified geographical region if certain findings are \nmade and the public has an opportunity to comment on the proposed IHA.\n    Specifically, NMFS will issue an IHA if it finds that the taking \nwill have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s) and will not \nhave an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species \nor stock(s) for taking for subsistence uses (where relevant). Further, \nNMFS must prescribe the permissible methods of taking and other ``means \nof effecting the least [practicable] adverse impact'' on the affected \nspecies or stocks and their habitat, paying particular attention to \nrookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance, and on \nthe availability of such species or stocks for taking for certain \nsubsistence uses (referred to here as ``mitigation''). NMFS must also \nprescribe requirements pertaining to monitoring and reporting of such \ntakings. The definition of key terms such as ``take,'' ``harassment,'' \nand ``negligible impact'' can be found in the MMPA and the NMFS' \nimplementing regulations (see 16 U.S.C. 1362; 50 CFR 216.103).\n    On April 4, 2025, a notice of NMFS' proposal to issue an IHA to \nARRC for take of marine mammals incidental to the Seward Freight Dock \nconstruction project in Seward, Alaska was published in the Federal \nRegister (90 FR 14792, April 4, 2025). In that notice, NMFS indicated \nthe estimated numbers, type, and methods of incidental take proposed \nfor each species or stock and the mitigation, monitoring, and reporting \nmeasures that would be required should the IHA be issued. The Federal \nRegister notice also included analysis to support NMFS' preliminary \nconclusions and determinations that the IHA, if issued, would satisfy \nthe requirements of section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA for issuance of \nthe IHA. The Federal Register notice included web links to a draft IHA \nfor review and other supporting documents.\n    No substantive comments were received during the public comment \nperiod. With the exception of the minor changes described below, there \nare no changes to the specified activity, the species taken, the \nproposed numbers, type, or methods of take, or the mitigation, \nmonitoring, or reporting measures in the proposed IHA notice. No new \ninformation that would change any of the preliminary analyses, \nconclusions, or determinations in the proposed IHA notice has become \navailable since that notice was published and, therefore, the \npreliminary analyses, conclusions, and determinations included in the \nproposed IHA are considered final.\n    Changes have been made to correct typographical errors to Tables 5 \nand 7 in the proposed Federal Register notice. In table 5, there were \nerrors in the tables sound pressure level categories. See below for the \nrevised table 5. In table 7, the Level A harassment zone for vibratory \ninstallation of H piles should have been 3.5 m for phocids instead of \n30.5 m. Additionally, text regarding the number of permanent piles \ninstalled via vibratory pile driving should have been 253 rather than \n256. None of these minor changes affect or change the analysis or the \nfindings in the proposed IHA notice.\n\n    Table 5--Estimates of Mean Underwater Sound Levels * Generated During In-Water Vibratory and Impact Pile\n                                     Installation and Vibratory Pile Removal\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Pile size and    dB RMS (dB re  dB peak (dB re   dB SEL (dB re\n            Method                   type          1 uPa RMS)      1 uPa peak)    1 uPa\\2\\-sec)     Reference\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVibratory install and removal  24-inch (61 cm)              163               -               -  NMFS 2023\n                                steel pile.

Accordingly, NMFS has determined that the \nissuance of the IHA qualifies to be categorically excluded from further \nNEPA review.\n\nEndangered Species Act\n\n    Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA; 16 \nU.S.C. 1531 et seq.) requires that each Federal agency insure that any \naction it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not likely to jeopardize \nthe continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or \nresult in the destruction or adverse modification of designated \ncritical habitat. To ensure ESA compliance for the issuance of IHAs, \nNMFS consults internally whenever we propose to authorize take for \nendangered or threatened species.\n    NMFS is authorizing take of the following distinct population \nsegments: Western U.S. Steller sea lion, Western North Pacific humpback \nwhale, the Mexico humpback whale, and fin whale, which are listed under \nthe ESA. The Permit and Conservation Division completed a section 7 \nconsultation with the Alaska Regional Office for the issuance of this \nIHA. The Alaska Regional Office's biological opinion states that the \naction is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the \nlisted species.\n\nAuthorization\n\n    Accordingly, consistent with the requirements of section \n101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA, NMFS has issued an IHA to ARRC for \nauthorization to take marine mammals incidental to Seward Freight Dock \nconstruction project in Seward, Alaska.\n\n    Dated: May 15, 2025.\nKimberly Damon-Randall,\nDirector, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries \nService.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09070 Filed 5-20-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 3510-22-P\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA; 16 \nU.S.C. 1531 et seq.) imposes prohibitions against the taking of \nthreatened and endangered species. Section 10 of the ESA allows permits \nauthorizing the taking of such species for research and enhancement \npurposes. The corresponding regulations established procedures for \npersons to apply for such permits. In addition, the regulations set \nforth specific reporting requirements for such permit holders. The \nregulations thus require two sets of information collections: (1) \nApplications for research/enhancement permits, and (2) prescribed \nreports for such permits once they are issued.\n    The required information is used to evaluate the impacts that \nresearch and enhancement activities have on endangered species, to make \nthe determinations required by the ESA before issuing any such permit, \nand to establish appropriate permit conditions. To issue permits under \nESA section 10(a)(1)(A), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) \nmust determine that (1) such exceptions were applied for in good faith, \n(2) if granted and exercised, will not operate to the disadvantage of \nsuch endangered species, and (3) will be consistent with the purposes \nand policy set forth in Section 2 of the ESA.

The initial IHA \nauthorized take of six species of marine mammals, by Level A and Level \nB harassment, incidental to construction activities associated with the \nLutak Dock Replacement project in Haines, Alaska. The project has been \ndelayed by 1 year and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has \nbeen conducted. The initial IHA was effective from June 1, 2024 through \nMay 31, 2025. The Haines Borough has requested reissuance with new \neffective dates of June 1, 2025 through May 31, 2026. The scope of the \nactivities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take \nnumbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and \nreporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, \ntherefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take \nanalyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.\n\nDATES: This authorization is effective from June 1, 2025 through May \n31, 2026.\n\nADDRESSES: An electronic copy of the final 2024 IHA previously issued \nto Haines Borough, the Haines Borough's application, and the Federal \nRegister notices proposing and issuing the initial IHA may be obtained \nby visiting <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/action/incidental-take-authorization-haines-boroughs-lutak-dock-replacement-project-haines-alaska\">https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/action/incidental-take-authorization-haines-boroughs-lutak-dock-replacement-project-haines-alaska</a>. In case of problems accessing these documents, please call the \ncontact listed below (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT).\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Craig Cockrell, Office of Protected \nResources, NMFS, (301) 427-8401.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \n\nBackground\n\n    Sections 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act \n(MMPA; 16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) direct the Secretary of Commerce (as \ndelegated to NMFS) to allow, upon request, the incidental, but not \nintentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals by U.S. citizens \nwho engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) \nwithin a specified geographical region if certain findings are made and \neither regulations are issued or, if the taking is limited to \nharassment, a notice of a proposed authorization is provided to the \npublic for review.\n    An authorization for incidental takings shall be granted if NMFS \nfinds that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or \nstock(s), will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the \navailability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses (where \nrelevant), and if the permissible methods of taking and requirements \npertaining to the mitigation, monitoring and reporting of such takings \nare set forth.\n    NMFS has defined ``negligible impact'' in 50 CFR 216.103 as an \nimpact resulting from the specified activity that cannot be reasonably \nexpected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the \nspecies or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or \nsurvival.\n    The MMPA states that the term ``take'' means to harass, hunt, \ncapture, kill or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine \nmammal.\n    Except with respect to certain activities not pertinent here, the \nMMPA defines ``harassment'' as any act of pursuit, torment, or \nannoyance which (i) has the potential to injure a marine mammal or \nmarine mammal stock in the wild (Level A harassment); or (ii) has the \npotential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild \nby causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not \nlimited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or \nsheltering (Level B harassment).\n\nSummary of Request\n\n    On February 16, 2024, NMFS published final notice of our issuance \nof an IHA authorizing take of marine mammals incidental to the Lutak \nDock Replacement project in Haines, Alaska (89 FR 12306). The effective \ndates of that IHA were June 1, 2024 through May 31, 2025. On March 18, \n2025, Haines Borough informed NMFS that the project would be delayed by \none year. None of the work identified in the initial IHA (e.g., pile \ndriving and removal) has occurred. The request was for NMFS to reissue \nan identical IHA that would be effective from June 1, 2025 through May \n31, 2026, in order to conduct the construction work that was analyzed \nand authorized through the previously issued IHA. Therefore, reissuance \nof the IHA is appropriate.\n\nSummary of Specified Activity and Anticipated Impacts\n\n    The planned activities (including mitigation, monitoring, and \nreporting), authorized incidental take, and anticipated impacts on the \naffected stocks are the same as those analyzed and authorized through \nthe previously issued IHA.\n    Haines Borough will encapsulate the existing Lutak Dock structure \nwith a new dock structure of similar design. In-water construction \nactivities associated with the project will include impact pile \ndriving, vibratory pile driving and removal, and down the hole drilling \ninstallation. The location, timing, and nature of the activities, \nincluding the types of equipment planned for use, are identical to \nthose described in the initial IHA. The mitigation and monitoring are \nalso as prescribed in the initial IHA.\n    Species that are expected to be taken by the planned activity \ninclude humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), killer whale (Orcinus \norca), harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), Dall's porpoise \n(Phocoenoides dalli), Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), and harbor \nseal (Phoca vitulina). A description of the methods and inputs used to \nestimate take anticipated to occur and, ultimately, the take that was \nauthorized\n\n[[Page 21757]]\n\nis found in the previous documents referenced above. The data inputs \nand methods of estimating take are identical to those used in the \ninitial IHA. NMFS has reviewed recent Stock Assessment Reports (SAR), \ninformation on relevant Unusual Mortality Events, and recent scientific \nliterature. NMFS determined that no new information is available that \naffects our original analysis of impacts or take estimate under the \ninitial IHA.\n    We refer to the documents related to the previously issued IHA, \nwhich include the Federal Register notice of the issuance of the \ninitial 2024 IHA for Haines Borough's construction work (89 FR 12306, \nFebruary 16, 2024), Haines Borough's application, the Federal Register \nnotice of the proposed IHA (88 FR 78310, November 15, 2023), and all \nassociated references and documents.\n\nDeterminations\n\n    Haines Borough will conduct activities as analyzed in the initial \n2024 IHA. As described above, the number of authorized takes of the \nsame species and stocks of marine mammals are identical to the numbers \nthat were found to meet the negligible impact small numbers standards \nand authorized under the initial IHA and no new information has emerged \nthat would change those findings. The reissued 2024 IHA includes \nidentical required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures as \nthe initial IHA, and there is no new information suggesting that our \nanalyses or findings should change.\n    Based on the information contained here and in the referenced \ndocuments, NMFS has determined the following: (1) the required \nmitigation measures will effect the least practicable impact on marine \nmammal species or stocks and their habitat; (2) the authorized takes \nwill have a negligible impact on the affected marine mammal species or \nstocks; (3) the authorized takes represent small numbers of marine \nmammals relative to the affected stock abundances; and (4) Haines \nBorough's activities will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on \ntaking for subsistence purposes.\n\nNational Environmental Policy Act\n\n    To comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA; \n42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 216-6A, \nNMFS must review our proposed action with respect to environmental \nconsequences on the human environment.\n    Accordingly, NMFS determined that the issuance of the initial IHA \nqualified to be categorically excluded from further NEPA review. NMFS \nhas determined that the application of this categorical exclusion \nremains appropriate for this reissued IHA.\n\nEndangered Species Act (ESA)\n\n    Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA: 16 \nU.S.C. 1531 et seq.) requires that each Federal agency ensure that any \naction it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not likely to jeopardize \nthe continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or \nresult in the destruction or adverse modification of designated \ncritical habitat. To ensure ESA compliance for the issuance of IHAs, \nNMFS consults internally, in this case with the Alaska Regional Office, \nwhenever we propose to authorize take for endangered or threatened \nspecies.\n    The effects of this proposed Federal action were adequately \nanalyzed in NMFS' Biological Opinion for the Port of Nome Modification \nProject, dated February 6, 2024, which concluded that the take NMFS \nproposed to authorize through this IHA would not jeopardize the \ncontinued existence of any endangered or threatened species or destroy \nor adversely modify any designated critical habitat.\n\nAuthorization\n\n    NMFS has issued an IHA to Haines Borough for in-water construction \nactivities associated with the specified activity from June 1, 2025 \nthrough May 31, 2026. All previously described mitigation, monitoring, \nand reporting requirements from the initial 2024 IHA are incorporated.\n\n    Dated: May 15, 2025.\nKimberly Damon-Randall,\nDirector, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries \nService.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09073 Filed 5-20-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 3510-22-P\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"

Abstract\n\n    The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which was enacted into law on \nSeptember 16, 2011, changed the procedures of the Patent Trial and \nAppeal Board (``PTAB'' or ``Board,'' formerly the Board of Patent \nAppeals and Interferences). These changes included the introduction of \ninter partes review, post-grant review, derivation proceedings, and the \ntransitional program for covered business method patents. Under these \nadministrative trial proceedings, third parties may file a petition \nwith the PTAB challenging the validity of issued patents, with each \nproceeding having different requirements regarding timing restrictions, \ngrounds for challenging validity, and who may request review.\n    Inter partes review is a trial proceeding conducted at the Board to\n\n[[Page 21758]]\n\nreview the patentability of one or more claims in a patent but only on \na ground that could be raised under 35 U.S.C. 102 or 103, and only on \nthe basis of prior art consisting of patents or printed publications. \nPost-grant review is a trial proceeding conducted at the Board to \nreview the patentability of one or more claims in a patent on any \nground that could be raised under section 282(b)(2) or (3). A \nderivation proceeding is a trial proceeding conducted at the Board to \ndetermine whether: (1) an inventor named in an earlier application \nderived the claimed invention from an inventor named in the \npetitioner's application, and (2) the earlier application claiming such \ninvention was filed without authorization. The transitional program for \ncovered business method patents is a trial proceeding conducted at the \nBoard to review the patentability of one or more claims in a covered \nbusiness method patent. The covered business method program expired on \nSeptember 16, 2020, and the Board no longer accepts new petitions \nrelated to this program, but continues to accept papers in previously-\ninstituted proceedings.\n    The USPTO's projections are based on data from the past year. The \nUSPTO recognizes that the numbers may fluctuate given interim changes \nto the institution process. The USPTO has adjusted the estimated burden \nhours and the number of estimated filings based on recent changes to \nthese proceedings.\n    This collection covers information submitted by the public to \npetition the Board to initiate an inter partes review, post-grant \nreview, derivation proceeding, and the transitional program for covered \nbusiness method patents, as well as any responses to such petitions, \nand the filing of any motions, replies, oppositions, and other actions, \nafter a review/proceeding has been instituted.\n\nII. Method of Collection\n\n    Applicants must submit the information electronically using Patent \nTrial and Appeal Case Tracking System filing system. Parties may seek \nauthorization to submit a filing by means other than electronic filing \npursuant to 42 CFR 42.6(b)(2).\n\nIII. Data\n\n    OMB Control Number: 0651-0069.\n    Forms: None.\n    Type of Review: Extension and revision of a currently approved \ninformation collection.\n    Affected Public: Private sector.\n    Respondent's Obligation: Required to obtain or retain benefits.\n    Frequency: On occasion.\n    Estimated Number of Annual Respondents: 7,897 respondents.\n    Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 11,947 responses.\n    Estimated Time per Response: The USPTO estimates that the responses \nin this information collection will take the public approximately 18 \nminutes (0.3 hours) to 170 hours to complete. This includes the time to \ngather the necessary information, create the document, and submit the \ncompleted item to the USPTO.\n    Estimated Total Annual Respondent Burden Hours: 590,630 hours.\n    Estimated Total Annual Respondent Hourly Cost Burden: $264,011,610.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 2023 Report of the Economic Survey, published by the \nCommittee on Economics of Legal Practice of the American \nIntellectual Property Law Association; pg.

Additional information about this \ninformation collection is also available at <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov\">https://www.reginfo.gov</a> \nunder ``Information Collection Review.''\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \n\nI. Abstract\n\n    This information collection includes the information necessary to \nsubmit a request to grant or revoke power of attorney for an \napplication, patent, or reexamination proceeding, and for a registered \npractitioner to withdraw as attorney or agent of record. This also \nincludes the information necessary to change the correspondence address \nfor an application, patent, or reexamination proceeding, to request a \nCustomer Number and manage the correspondence address and list of \npractitioners associated with a Customer Number, and to designate or \nchange the correspondence address or fee address for one or more \npatents or applications by using a Customer Number.\n    Under 35 U.S.C. 2 and 37 CFR 1.31 and 1.32, power of attorney may \nbe granted to one or more joint inventors or a person who is registered \nto practice before the USPTO to act in an application or a patent. For \nan application filed before September 16, 2012, or for a patent which \nissued from an application filed before September 16, 2012, power of \nattorney may be granted by the applicant for patent (as set forth in 37 \nCFR 1.41(b) (pre-AIA)) or the assignee of the entire interest of the \napplicant. For an application filed on or after September 16, 2012, or \nfor a patent which issued from an application filed on or after \nSeptember 16, 2012, power of attorney may be granted by the applicant \nfor patent (as set forth in 37 CFR 1.42) or the patent owner. The USPTO \nprovides two different versions of most forms for establishing power of \nattorney based upon whether the application was filed before September \n16, 2012 or was filed on or after September 16, 2012. Providing forms \nbased upon whether the application was filed before September 16, 2012 \nor was filed on or after September 16, 2012 reduces applicants' burden \nin having to determine the appropriate power of attorney requirements \nfor a given application.\n    37 CFR 1.36 provides for the revocation of a power of attorney at \nany stage in the proceedings of a case. 37 CFR 1.36 also provides a \npath by which a registered patent attorney or patent agent who has been \ngiven a power of attorney may withdraw as attorney or agent of record.\n    A Customer Number is a unique number created by the USPTO and is \nused instead of a physical address. The Customer Number allows a group \nof filings to be associated with a single correspondence mailing \naddress. The USPTO's Customer Number practice permits applicants, \npatent owners, assignees, and practitioners of record, or the \nrepresentatives of record for a number of applications or patents, to \nchange the correspondence address of a patent application or patent \nwith one change request instead of filing separate requests for each \npatent or application. Any changes to the address or practitioner \ninformation associated with a Customer Number will be applied to all \npatents and applications associated with said Customer Number.\n    Changes of correspondence address or power of attorney may be filed \nseparately for each patent or application without using a Customer \nNumber. However, a valid Customer Number provides secure access to \npatent information through the registered <a href=\"http://USPTO.gov\">USPTO.gov</a> account using the \nUSPTO patent electronic filing system (Patent Center), which is \navailable through the USPTO website.

By centralizing data \nprovided by state education agencies about state level data, local \neducation agencies, and schools, NCES and other components of ED use \nthe EDFacts data to report on students, schools, staff, services, and \neducation outcomes at the state, district, and school levels. The \ncentralized approach provides ED users with the ability to efficiently \nanalyze and report on submitted data and has reduced the reporting \nburden for state and local data producers through the use of \nstreamlined data collection, analysis, and reporting tools. EDFacts \ncollects information on behalf of ED grant and program offices for \napproximately 170 data groups for all 50 states, Washington, DC, Puerto \nRico, and seven outlying areas and freely associated states (American \nSamoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Republic of Palau, and \nthe U.S. Virgin Islands), the Department of Defense Education Activity \n(DoDEA), and the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE).\n    This request is to collect EDFacts data for the 2025-26, 2026-27, \nand 2027-28 school years. Due to overlap in the timing of data \ncollection activities between consecutive years of the EDFacts \ncollection, we are carrying over in this submission the approved SY \n2024-25 data collection, which is scheduled to end in February 2026.\n\nRoss Santy,\nChief Data Officer, Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy \nDevelopment.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09085 Filed 5-20-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4000-01-P\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"

Reese, \nSecretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 12225 Wilkins Avenue, \nRockville, Maryland 20852. All filings must clearly identify the \nproject name and docket number on the first page: Lewiston Falls \nHydroelectric Project (P-2302-101).\n    The Commission's Rules of Practice require all intervenors filing \ndocuments with the Commission to serve a copy of that document on each \nperson on the official service list for the project. Further, if an \nintervenor files comments or documents with the Commission relating to \nthe merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a \nparticular resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document \non that resource agency.\n    k. This application has been accepted and is now ready for \nenvironmental analysis.\n    l. The existing Lewiston Falls Hydroelectric Project consists of: \n(1) a dam consisting of 5 distinct sections: (a) a 154-foot-long stone \nmasonry section topped with a single rubber dam for a total elevation \nof 169.07 feet, (b) a 279-foot-long stone masonry section topped with a \nsingle rubber dam for a total elevation of 169.07 feet, (c) a 161-foot-\nlong stone masonry section topped with a single rubber dam for a total \nelevation of 168.60 feet, (d) a 162-foot-long stone masonry section \ntopped with a single rubber dam for a total elevation of 168.60 feet, \nand (e) a 57-foot-long concrete section topped with 1.34-foot-high \nflashboards for a total elevation of 168.17 feet; (2) a 2.5-mile-long, \n169-acre impoundment at a full pond elevation of 168.17 feet; (3) an \n85.16-foot-long, 60-foot-high reinforced concrete intake with 3.25-inch \nspaced trashracks; (4) four 16.8-foot wide intake tubes, each pair \nconverging into one; (4) a reinforced concrete powerhouse containing \ntwo vertical Kaplan turbine generators for a total installed capacity \nof 28.44 megawatts; (5) a 400-foot-long, 75-foot-wide excavated \ntailrace; (6) a 111.6-foot-long, 26.3-foot-wide masonry canal gatehouse \nlocated at the southeast corner of the impoundment diverting flow to a \ncanal system; (7) a 12.5 to 34.5-kilovolt (kV) transformer; (8) a 125-\nfoot-long underground transmission line connected to Central Maine \nPower's distribution system; and (8) appurtenant facilities. The \nproject average annual generation between 2013 and 2023 was 157,614 \nmegawatt-hours (MWh).\n    Brookfield currently operates the project in a run-of-river mode by \ntypically limiting impoundment drawdowns to no more than 1 foot below \nthe normal elevation of 168.17 feet. However, the project is licensed \nto operate with up to four feet of impoundment drawdowns. The current \nlicense requires Brookfield to release a minimum flow of 1,430 cfs or \ninflow, whichever is less. Brookfield states that it meets this \nrequirement by releasing 50 cfs from the impoundment to the Lewiston \nCanal System and 1,380 cfs to the river downstream of the project. The \nmaximum hydraulic capacity of the project's generating units is 6,600 \ncfs and the minimum hydraulic capacity of a single unit is \napproximately 800 cfs.\n    The licensee is proposing to remove an existing building from the \nproject boundary. The building is a non-project facility and is located \nnear the Canal Gatehouse. The building is privately owned and serves no \nproject purpose, according to Brookfield's application. In total, this \nchange will remove 0.08 acre from the project boundary, resulting in a \ntotal of 237.88 acres remaining within the project boundary.\n    m. A copy of the application can be viewed on the Commission's \nwebsite (<a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov\">https://www.ferc.gov</a>), using the ``eLibrary'' link. Enter the \ndocket number, excluding the last three digits in the docket number \nfield, to access the document. For assistance, please contact FERC \nOnline Support (see item j above).\n    You may also register at <a href=\"https://ferconline.ferc.gov/FERCOnline.aspx\">https://ferconline.ferc.gov/FERCOnline.aspx</a> to be notified via email of new filings and issuances \nrelated to this or other pending projects. For assistance, please \ncontact FERC Online Support (see item j above).\n    n. The applicant must file no later than 60 days following the date \nof issuance of this notice: (1) a copy of the water quality \ncertification; (2) a copy of the request for certification, including\n\n[[Page 21769]]\n\nproof of the date on which the certifying agency received the request; \nor (3) evidence of waiver of water quality certification. Please note \nthat the certification request must comply with 40 CFR 121.5(b), \nincluding documentation that a pre-filing meeting request was submitted \nto the certifying authority at least 30 days prior to submitting the \ncertification request. Please also note that the certification request \nmust be sent to the certifying authority and to the Commission \nconcurrently.\n    o. Final amendments to the application must be filed with the \nCommission no later than 30 days from the issuance date of this notice.\n\n    Dated: May 15, 2025.\nCarlos D.

Background\n\nNEPA and CEs\n\n    The National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347, (NEPA) \nrequires Federal agencies to interpret and administer Federal policies, \nregulations, and laws in accordance with NEPA's policies and to \nconsider environmental values in their decision making.\n    Section 102(2) of NEPA requires Federal agencies to provide a \ndetailed statement on proposals for major Federal actions significantly \naffecting the quality of the human environment.\\1\\ NEPA also created \nthe Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) as the body responsible for \nimplementing NEPA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ 42 U.S.C. 4332.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Categorical exclusions (CEs) can be used when there is a \ndetermination the proposed type of action would not have a significant \neffect on the human environment; this option eliminates the need for an \nenvironmental assessment (EA) or more detailed environmental impact \nstatement (EIS).\n    Section 109 of NEPA, enacted as part of the Fiscal Responsibility \nAct of 2023, allows a Federal agency to ``adopt'' or use another \nagency's CEs for a category of proposed agency actions.\\2\\ To use \nanother agency's CEs under section 109, an agency must identify the \nrelevant CEs listed in another agency's (``establishing agency'') NEPA \nprocedures that cover its category of proposed actions or related \nactions; consult with the establishing agency to ensure that the \nproposed adoption of the CE to a category of actions is appropriate; \nidentify to the public the CE that the agency plans to use for its \nproposed actions; and document adoption of the CE. EXIM has prepared \nthis notice to meet these statutory requirements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ 42 U.S.C. 4336c.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgram Background\n\n    As the official export credit agency of the United States, ``the \nmission of the Export-Import Bank of the United States is to support \nthe creation of American jobs by facilitating the export of U.S. goods \nand services.'' The Export--Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) \nsteps in when the private sector does not provide financing for \nAmerican businesses. The Bank's actions have historically helped \nsupport these firms in competing with foreign businesses overseas. The \nMake More in America (MMIA) initiative applies EXIM's authorities for \nmedium and long-term (MLT) loans, loan guarantees, and insurance to \nexport-oriented domestic projects. In doing so, MMIA allows EXIM to \nsupport American business during the whole export lifecycle. The \npurpose of such loans remains unchanged: to support U.S. employment.\n    As EXIM usually lends to projects outside the United States, NEPA \nhas not often been applicable as there is no impact to the human \nenvironment in the United States. In the MMIA initiative, which focuses \non domestic lending, adopting CEs from another agency will speed up the \nprocessing time of deals and conserve staff resources with no need for \nan EA or EIS. Faster processing times in this initiative will greatly \nfacilitate EXIM's support of American businesses and workers.\n\nII. Identification of the Categorical Exclusions\n\nTennessee Valley Authority CEs\n\n    49. Financial assistance including, but not limited to, approving \nand administering grants, loans and rebates for the renovation or minor \nupgrading of existing facilities, established or developing industrial \nparks, or existing infrastructure; the extension of infrastructure; \ngeotechnical boring; and construction of commercial and light \nindustrial buildings. Generally, such assistance supports actions that \nphysically disturb no more than 10 acres of land not previously \ndisturbed by human activity or no more than 25 acres of land so \ndisturbed.\n    50. Financial assistance for the following actions: Approving and \nadministering grants, loans and rebates for continued operations or \npurchase of existing facilities and infrastructure for uses \nsubstantially the same as the current use; purchasing, installing, and \nreplacing equipment or machinery at existing facilities; and completing \nengineering designs, architectural drawings, surveys, and site \nassessments (except when tree clearing, geotechnical boring, or other \nland disturbance would occur).\n    The Tennessee Valley Authority CEs also include extraordinary \ncircumstances that should require special factors to review the \napplication of CEs under 18 CFR 1318.201. These extraordinary \ncircumstances include if the action is or may be highly controversial \nor has the potential to significantly impact environmental resources, \nincluding the following resources:\n    (i) Species listed or proposed to be listed under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, or the proposed or designated Critical Habitat for these \nspecies,\n    (ii) Wetlands or floodplains,\n    (iii) Cultural or historical resources,\n    (iv) Areas having special designation or recognition such as wild \nand scenic rivers, parklands, or wilderness areas, and\n    (v) Important farmland.\n\nIII. Proposed EXIM Category of Actions\n\n    EXIM intends to apply these categorical exclusions to loans, loan \nguarantees, and insurance transactions. The scope of projects would be \nakin to projects to which the Tennessee Valley Authority has applied \nthese categorical exclusions. These include limited construction, full \ndisposal of buildings, desk work for feasibility studies, soil testing, \netc. In principle, such transactions would be similar and comparable to \nthose EXIM's export finance transactions deemed a category C under its \nenvironmental and social procedures and guidelines.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ EXIM's Environmental and Social Due Diligence Procedures and \nGuidelines state that ``applications greater than $10 Million will \nbe classified as Category C if they are not related to a physical \nproject or if they relate to projects which do not require further \nenvironmental review because they are likely to have minimal or no \nadverse environmental or social risks or impacts. This category \nincludes transactions related to new, expansion or existing projects \nof the type that have little or no potential to cause environmental \neffects and do not impact sensitive locations.'' <a href=\"https://www.exim.gov/policies/exim-bank-and-environment/procedures-and-guidelines\">https://www.exim.gov/policies/exim-bank-and-environment/procedures-and-guidelines</a>.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 21773]]\n\nIV. Consideration of Extraordinary Circumstances (if Applicable)\n\n    In assessing whether a categorical exclusion applies, EXIM would \nreview whether there were extraordinary circumstances that would \nindicate a categorical exclusion is not appropriate due to the \npotential for a significant environmental effect. EXIM would review \nthat proposed actions do not breach the extraordinary circumstances \nlisted by TVA. When applying these CEs, EXIM will consider whether the \nproposed action has the potential to result in significant effects as \ndescribed in TVA's definition of extraordinary circumstances, as \nwritten above.\n    EXIM's Engineering and Environment Division will have \nresponsibility for determining if a categorical exclusion applies. \nThese determinations will be posted at <a href=\"https://www.exim.gov/policies/exim-bank-and-environment/make-more-america-initiative-approved-transactions\">https://www.exim.gov/policies/exim-bank-and-environment/make-more-america-initiative-approved-transactions</a>.\n\nConsultation and Determination of Appropriateness\n\nConsultations\n1. Tennessee Valley Authority Consultation\n    In May 2025, EXIM conducted consultation with the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority on adoption of two CE categories. EXIM and TVA's consultation \nincluded a review of TVA's experience developing and applying the CEs, \nas well as the types of actions for which EXIM plans to utilize the \nCEs. These EXIM actions are similar to the type of projects that TVA \nfunds and therefore the impacts of EXIM projects will be similar to the \nimpacts of TVA projects, which are not significant, absent the \nexistence of extraordinary circumstances that could involve potentially \nsignificant impacts. Therefore, EXIM has determined that its proposed \nuse of the CEs as described in this notice would be appropriate.\nNotice to the Public and Documentation of the Adoption\n    This notice serves to identify to the public and document EXIM's \nadoption of two CEs from the Tennessee Valley Authority. The notice \nidentifies the types of actions to which EXIM will apply the CE, as \nwell as the considerations that EXIM will use in determining whether an \naction is within the scope of the CE.\n\nScott Condren,\nVice President, Policy Analysis.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09062 Filed 5-20-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 6690-01-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Under \nthe pilot, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may \nselect up to five state TANF grantees to negotiate performance \nbenchmarks for work and family stability outcomes instead of adhering \nto the standard TANF Work Participation Rate. The ACF Office of Family \nAssistance (OFA) administers federal grant programs that foster family \neconomic stability and independence, including the TANF program. As \nsuch, OFA is responsible for designing and carrying out the FRA TANF \nPilot Program, including selecting the five states to participate in \nthe pilot, working with the states to identify performance benchmarks \nand associated targets, and monitoring performance of the pilot states \nthroughout the duration of the pilot.\n    ACF received approval for a previous information collection (Title: \nFiscal Responsibility Act TANF Pilot Program; OMB #: 0970-0531) on July \n17, 2024. Twenty-three states and territories responded to the \ninformation collection from July through September 2024. In November \n2024, ACF announced the selection of five states to participate in the \nFRA TANF Pilot Program. In March 2025, the Trump Administration \nannounced a new direction for the FRA TANF Pilot Program, ending pilot \nparticipation for the states selected in November of 2024 and \ncommunicating plans to issue a new request for pilot proposals aligned \nwith the Administration's focus on promoting work and reducing \ndependency and the key measures of success related to those priorities. \nThis new request to OMB is to collect information from states about \ntheir interest and suitability for participation in the new direction \nbeing taken for the FRA TANF Pilot Program.\n    OFA also intends to provide programmatic technical assistance (TA) \nto the pilot states. ACF's Office of\n\n[[Page 21777]]\n\nPlanning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) studies ACF programs, \nincluding TANF, and the populations they serve through rigorous \nresearch and evaluation projects. OPRE will be responsible for the \nfederal evaluation of the FRA TANF Pilots Program and intends to \nprovide data- and evaluation-related TA to the pilot states.\n    Respondents: States operating TANF programs and interested in \ninnovations within those programs focused on promoting work and \nreducing dependency. In accordance with title IV-A of the Social \nSecurity Act, states is defined as the 50 States of the United States, \nthe District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United \nStates Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. See 42 U.S.C. 619(5).\n\nAnnual Burden Estimates\n\n    The Proposal for TANF Pilot Program Participation is intentionally \nsuccinct and will be considered in combination with existing sources of \nadministrative data. Therefore, ACF estimates that a state will spend \napproximately 10 hours compiling information and responding to the \nrequest. In the first issuing of this information collection in July \n2024, ACF received responses from 23 states and territories. The \nestimated number of respondents in the table below is based on the \nnumber of responses received in the first round and ACF's expectations \nfor number of responses in the second round.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Total number of\n             Instrument                Total number of      responses per      Average burden      Total burden\n                                         respondents         respondent      hours per response       hours\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProposal for TANF Pilot Program                     25                   1                  10              250\n Participation.....................\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Authority: 42 U.S.C. 611(e).\n\nMary C.

Background\n\n    Section 564 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3) allows FDA to \nstrengthen the public health protections against biological, chemical, \nnuclear, and radiological agents. Among other things, section 564 of \nthe FD&C Act allows FDA to authorize the use of an unapproved medical \nproduct or an unapproved use of an approved medical product in certain \nsituations.\n    On April 30, 2020, FDA issued an Authorization to Fresenius, for \nmultiFiltrate PRO System and multiBic/multiPlus solutions, subject to \nthe terms of the Authorization. Notice of the issuance of the \nAuthorization was published in the Federal Register on September 11, \n2020 (85 FR 56231), as required by section 564(h)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n    On August 13, 2020, FDA issued an Authorization to Baxter, for \nREGIOCIT, subject to the terms of the Authorization. Notice of the \nissuance of the Authorization was published in the Federal Register on \nFebruary 19, 2021 (86 FR 10290), as required by section 564(h)(1) of \nthe FD&C Act.\n    The authorization of a drug for emergency use under section 564 of \nthe FD&C Act may, pursuant to section 564(g)(2) of the FD&C Act, be \nrevoked when the criteria under section 564(c) of the FD&C Act for \nissuance of such authorization are no longer met (section 564(g)(2)(B) \nof the FD&C Act), or other circumstances make such revocation \nappropriate to protect the public health or safety (section \n564(g)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act).\n\nII. EUA Revocation Request\n\n    In a request received by FDA on January 14, 2025, Fresenius \nrequested revocation of, and on January 16, 2025, FDA revoked, the \nAuthorization for multiFiltrate PRO System and multiBic/multiPlus \nsolutions. Because Fresenius has informed FDA that it does not intend \nto offer the multiFiltrate Pro System and multiBic/multiPlus solutions \nunder the EUA in the United States anymore, Fresenius requested FDA \nrevoke the EUA for multiFiltrate PRO System and multiBic/multiPlus \nsolutions. FDA has determined that it is appropriate to protect the \npublic health or safety to revoke this Authorization.\n    In a request received by FDA on January 14, 2025, Baxter requested \nrevocation of, and on January 16, 2025, FDA revoked, the Authorization \nfor REGIOCIT. Because Baxter has informed FDA that it does not intend \nto offer this product under the EUA in the United States anymore, \nBaxter requested FDA\n\n[[Page 21783]]\n\nrevoke the EUA for REGIOCIT. FDA has determined that it is appropriate \nto protect the public health or safety to revoke this Authorization.\n\nIII.

The revision \nrequest involves implementing a burden reducing change. Specifically, \nOHRP is seeking to\n\n[[Page 21785]]\n\nremove the IRB roster membership information from the IRB registration \nform. This change will align the IRB registration form with the 2018 \nRequirements at 45 CFR 46.103. The change, when implemented, is \nanticipated to result in a shorter, simplified IRB registration process \nfor respondents. Updates to the software applications OHRP uses to \nmanage IRB registration will be deployed to enable such changes.\n    The current form is approved through June 30, 2025. The purpose of \nthe form is to provide a simplified procedure for: (1) IRBs to satisfy \nthe requirements for IRB registration at 45 CFR part 46, subpart E; and \n(2) IRBs in the United States (US) to satisfy the FDA requirements for \nIRB registration at 21 CFR 56.106.\n    Institutions engaged in nonexempt human subjects research conducted \nor supported by HHS, or another Common Rule department or agency, are \nrequired by the terms of the Federalwide Assurance (FWA) to rely upon \nonly IRBs registered with OHRP for review of research to which the FWA \napplies, and must designate a registered IRB on the institution's FWA \nsubmission to OHRP. In this way, OHRP's FWA submission process, \nestablished pursuant to the requirements for assurances at 45 CFR \n46.103, is linked to the regulatory requirements for IRB registration.\n    The respondents for this information collection are institutions or \norganizations operating IRBs that review human subjects research \nconducted or supported by HHS; or, in the case of FDA's requirements, \neach IRB in the United States that reviews clinical investigations \nregulated by FDA under sections 505(i) or 520(g) of the Federal Food, \nDrug and Cosmetic Act; and each IRB in the United States that reviews \nclinical investigations that are intended to support applications for \nresearch or marketing permits for FDA-regulated products. Many of the \nIRBs also review research conducted or supported by other Common Rule \ndepartments and agencies.\n\n                                          Annualized Burden Hour Table\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                       Average\n                                                        Number of      Number of      burden per   Total burden\n                      Form name                        respondents   responses per     response        hours\n                                                                       respondent     (in hours)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIRB Registration 0990-0279 Update and Renew.........         5,350                1         0.33           1,766\nIRB-Registration 0990-0279 Initial and Update.......           350                2     0.5/0.33             291\n                                                     -----------------------------------------------------------\n    Total...........................................  ............  ...............  ...........           2,057\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSusan R.

Digital \nhealth companies develop apps and health IT tools that enable human \ninteraction with APIs to exchange electronic health information. Prior \nstudies indicate widespread adoption of standardized APIs for \ninteroperability with electronic health records (EHRs). Ongoing \nassessment of these technologies is crucial to examining the impacts of \nthe Cures Act's health IT provisions and is critical to informing the \nAssistant Secretary for Technology Policy/Office of the National \nCoordinator for Health IT's (ASTP/ONC's) policy efforts. With ASTP/\nONC's support, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) \nconducted a 2022 survey of digital health companies assessing \nimplementation of and experiences with healthcare APIs; findings from \nthis survey work are published in the Journal of the American Medical \nInformatics Association. ASTP/ONC finds it essential to continue \nefforts to survey digital health companies to assess ASTP/ONC's \nimplementation of statutorily mandated information blocking (42 U.S.C. \n300jj-52) and APIs ``without special effort'' policies (42 U.S.C. \n300jj-11) under the Cures Act. Information gathered from this effort \nwill help inform ongoing ASTP/ONC efforts to help nurture an ecosystem \nof innovation and transparency in health care.\n\n[[Page 21786]]\n\n\n\n                                          Annualized Burden Hour Table\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                       Average\n                                  Respondents (if       Number of      Number of      burden per   Total burden\n     Forms (if necessary)            necessary)        respondents   responses per     response        hours\n                                                                      respondents     (minutes)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal........................
