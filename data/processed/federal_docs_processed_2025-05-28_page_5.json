Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance \nof the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    The Exchange proposes to amend the Short Term Option Series Program \nin Supplementary Material .03 of Options 4, Section 5 to permit the \nlisting of up to two Monday and Wednesday expirations for options on \ncertain individual stocks or Exchange-Traded Fund Shares.\n    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's \nwebsite at <a href=\"https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/ise/rulefilings\">https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/ise/rulefilings</a>, \nat the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public \nReference Room.\n\nII. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements \nconcerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and \ndiscussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The \ntext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in \nItem IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in \nsections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such \nstatements.\n\nA. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and \nStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change\n\n1. Purpose\n    The Exchange proposes to amend the Short Term Option Series Program \nin Supplementary Material .03 of Options 4, Section 5. Specifically, \nthe Exchange proposes to permit the listing of up to two Monday and \nWednesday expirations for options on certain individual stocks or \nExchange-Traded Fund Shares (collectively ``Qualifying Securities'').\n    Currently, as set forth in Supplementary Material .03 to Options 4, \nSection 5, after an option class has been approved for listing and \ntrading on the Exchange as a Short Term Option Series pursuant to \nOptions 1, Section 1(a)(49),\\3\\ the Exchange may open for\n\n[[Page 21806]]\n\ntrading on any Thursday or Friday that is a business day (``Short Term \nOption Opening Date'') series of options on that class that expire at \nthe close of business on each of the next five Fridays that are \nbusiness days and are not Fridays in which standard expiration options \nseries, Monthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options Series expire \n(``Friday Short Term Option Expiration Dates''). The Exchange may have \nno more than a total of five Short Term Option Expiration Dates \n(``Short Term Option Weekly Expirations''). Further, if the Exchange is \nnot open for business on the respective Thursday or Friday, the Short \nTerm Option Opening Date for Short Term Option Weekly Expirations will \nbe the first business day immediately prior to that respective Thursday \nor Friday. Similarly, if the Exchange is not open for business on a \nFriday, the Short Term Option Expiration Date for Short Term Option \nWeekly Expirations will be the first business day immediately prior to \nthat Friday.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ Options 1, Section 1(a)(49) provides that a Short Term \nOption Series means a series in an option class that is approved for \nlisting and trading on the Exchange in which the series is opened \nfor trading on any Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday \nthat is a business day and that expires on the Monday, Wednesday or \nFriday of the following business week that is a business day, or, in \nthe case of a series that is listed on a Friday and expires on a \nMonday, is listed one business week and one business day prior to \nthat expiration. If a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday is not \na business day, the series may be opened (or shall expire) on the \nfirst business day immediately prior to that Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday or Friday. For a series listed pursuant to this section for \nMonday expiration, if a Monday is not a business day, the series \nshall expire on the first business day immediately following that \nMonday.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Additionally, the Exchange may open for trading series of options \non the symbols provided in Table 1 of Supplementary Material .03 to \nOptions 4, Section 5 that expire at the close of business on each of \nthe next two Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, \nrespectively, that are business days beyond the current week and are \nnot business days in which standard expiration options series, Monthly \nOptions Series, or Quarterly Options Series expire (``Short Term Option \nDaily Expirations'').\\4\\ For those symbols listed in Table 1, the \nExchange may have no more than a total of two Short Term Option Daily \nExpirations beyond the current week for each of Monday, Tuesday, \nWednesday, and Thursday expirations, as applicable, at one time.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ As set forth in Table 1 of Supplementary Material .03 to \nOptions 4, Section 5, the Exchange currently permits expirations in \nSPY, IWM, QQQ on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Also, \nthe Exchange permits expirations in GLD, SLV and TLT on Mondays and \nWednesdays. Finally, the Exchange permits expirations in USO and UNG \non Wednesdays.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposal\n    At this time, the Exchange proposes to expand the Short Term Option \nSeries Program to permit certain Qualifying Securities to list up to \ntwo Monday and Wednesday expirations in addition to the Friday weekly \nexpiration.\n    The Exchange proposes to define Qualifying Securities as eligible \nindividual stocks or Exchange-Traded Fund Shares, which are separate \nand apart from the symbols listed in Table 1, that have received \napproval to list additional expiries on specific symbols, that meet the \nfollowing criteria on a quarterly basis:\n\n    (1) an underlying security, as measured on the last day of the \nprior calendar quarter, must have:\n    (A) a market capitalization of greater than 700 billion dollars \nfor an individual stock based on the closing price,\\5\\ or\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ The closing price and the opening price shall be that of the \nprimary exchange where the security is listed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    (B) Assets under Management (``AUM'') greater than 50 billion \ndollars for an Exchange-Traded Fund Share based on net asset value \n(``NAV'');\n    (2) monthly options volume, as measured by sides traded in the \nlast month preceding the quarter end, of greater than 10 million \noptions;\n    (3) a position limit of at least 250,000 contracts; and\n    (4) participate in the Penny Interval Program.\n\n    Each calendar quarter, the Exchange will apply the above criteria \nto individual stocks and Exchange-Traded Fund Shares to determine \neligibility for the following quarter as a Qualifying Security. \nBeginning on the second trading day in the first month of each calendar \nquarter, the market capitalization of individual stocks shall be \ncalculated based on the closing price established on the primary \nexchange on the last trading day of the prior calendar quarter and the \nAUM for Exchange-Traded Fund Shares shall be calculated based on the \nNAV established on the primary exchange on the last trading day of the \nprior calendar quarter. The data establishing the volume thresholds \nwill be established by using data from the last month of the prior \ncalendar quarter from The Options Clearing Corporation. For options \nlisted on the first trading day of a given calendar quarter, the volume \nshall be calculated using the last month of the quarter prior to the \nlast trading calendar quarter.\\6\\ ISE will make the list of Qualifying \nSecurities available by the close of business on the first trading day \nof the quarter.\\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ OCC data becomes available for the end of a quarter on the \nfirst trading day of a new quarter.\n    \\7\\ ISE will make this information available on ISE's website. \nThis information will be freely accessible to the public.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Eligible Qualifying Securities would be permitted to list two Short \nTerm Option Expiration Dates beyond the current week for each Monday \nand Wednesday expiration at one time. For Qualifying Securities, the \nExchange would not list an expiry on a day where there will be an \nEarnings Announcement that takes place after market close. For purposes \nof this rule proposal, earnings announcements shall include official \npublic quarterly or yearly earnings filed with the Commission \n(``Earnings Announcement'').\\8\\ Not listing an expiry for a Qualifying \nSecurity on a day where there is an Earnings Announcement that takes \nplace after market close will avoid permitting an additional expiry on \na day where post-close price volatility may be impacted due to the \nEarnings Announcement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\8\\ For purposes of this rule proposal, pre-announcements or \n``guidance'' shall not be considered an Earnings Announcement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Qualifying Securities that do not continue to meet the above \ncriteria would no longer be permitted to list Monday and Wednesday \nexpiries beginning on the second day of the following quarter.\\9\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ The Exchange has noted the additional expiries in a proposed \nTable 2 in Supplementary Material .03 to Options 4, Section 5 along \nwith the criteria for a Qualifying Security.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The proposed Monday Qualifying Securities expirations will be \nsimilar to the current Monday Expirations in SPY, QQQ, and IWM (among \nother symbols that may list a Monday Expiration) in Short Term Option \nDaily Expirations set forth in Supplementary Material .03 to Options 4, \nSection 5, such that the Exchange may open for trading on any Friday or \nMonday that is a business day (beyond the current week) series of \noptions on Qualifying Securities to expire on any Monday of the month \nthat is a business day and is not a Monday in which standard expiration \noptions series, Monthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options Series \nexpire, provided that Monday expirations that are listed on a Friday \nmust be listed at least one business week and one business day prior to \nthe expiration (``Monday Qualifying Securities Expirations'').\\10\\ In \nthe event Qualifying Securities expire on a Monday and that Monday is \nthe same day that a standard expiration options series, Monthly Options \nSeries, or Quarterly Options\n\n[[Page 21807]]\n\nSeries expires, the Exchange would skip that week's listing and instead \nlist the following week; the two weeks would therefore not be \nconsecutive. Today, Monday expirations in SPY, QQQ, and IWM similarly \nskip the weekly listing in the event the weekly listing expires on the \nsame day in the same class as a standard expiration options series, \nMonthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options Series.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\10\\ They may also trade on Fridays, as is the case for all \noptions series in the Short Term Option Series Program.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The proposed Wednesday Qualifying Securities expirations will be \nsimilar to the current Wednesday SPY, QQQ, and IWM (among other symbols \nthat may list a Wednesday Expiration) in Short Term Option Daily \nExpirations set forth in Supplementary Material .03 to Options 4, \nSection 5, such that the Exchange may open for trading on any Tuesday \nor Wednesday that is a business day (beyond the current week) series of \noptions on Qualifying Securities to expire on any Wednesday of the \nmonth that is a business day and is not a Wednesday in which standard \nexpiration options series, Monthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options \nSeries expire (``Wednesday Qualifying Securities Expirations'').\\11\\ In \nthe event Qualifying Securities expire on a Wednesday and that \nWednesday is the same day that a standard expiration options series, \nMonthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options Series expires, the \nExchange would skip that week's listing and instead list the following \nweek; the two weeks would therefore not be consecutive. Today, \nWednesday expirations in SPY, QQQ, and IWM similarly skip the weekly \nlisting in the event the weekly listing expires on the same day in the \nsame class as a standard expiration options series, Monthly Options \nSeries, or Quarterly Options Series.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\11\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The interval between strike prices for the proposed Monday and \nWednesday Qualifying Securities Expirations will be the same as those \ncurrently applicable for SPY, QQQ, and IWM Monday and Wednesday \nExpirations (among other symbols that may list a Monday or Wednesday \nExpiration) in the Short Term Option Series Program.\\12\\ Specifically, \nthe Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Securities Expirations will have a \nstrike interval of (i) $0.50 or greater for strike prices below $100, \nand $1 or greater for strike prices between $100 and $150 for all \noption classes that participate in the Short Term Option Series \nProgram, (ii) $0.50 for option classes that trade in one dollar \nincrements and are in the Short Term Option Series Program, or (iii) \n$2.50 or greater for strike prices above $150.\\13\\ As is the case with \nother equity options series listed pursuant to the Short Term Option \nSeries Program, the Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Securities \nExpirations series will be P.M.-settled.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\12\\ See Supplementary Material .03(e) to Options 4, Section 5. \nThe Exchange notes that equity options which have an expiration of \nmore than twenty-one days from the listing date would also be \nsubject to the intervals as noted within Supplementary Material \n.03(f) to Options 4, Section 5. See also Supplementary .07 to \nOptions 4, Section 5.\n    \\13\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Pursuant to Options 1, Section 1(a)(49), with respect to the Short \nTerm Option Series Program, if a Monday is not a business day, the \nseries shall expire on the first business day immediately following \nthat Monday. Also, pursuant to Options 1, Section 1(a)(49), with \nrespect to the Short Term Option Series Program, a Wednesday expiration \nseries shall expire on the first business day immediately prior to that \nWednesday, e.g., Tuesday of that week if the Wednesday is not a \nbusiness day.\n    Currently, for each option class eligible for participation in the \nShort Term Option Series Program, the Exchange is limited to opening \nthirty (30) series for each expiration date for the specific class.\\14\\ \nThe thirty (30) series restriction does not include series that are \nopen by other securities exchanges under their respective weekly rules; \nthe Exchange may list these additional series that are listed by other \noptions exchanges.\\15\\ With the proposed changes, this thirty (30) \nseries restriction would apply to Monday and Wednesday Qualifying \nSecurities Expirations as well. In addition, the Exchange will be able \nto list series that are listed by other exchanges, assuming they file \nsimilar rules with the Commission to list Monday and Wednesday \nQualifying Securities Expirations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\14\\ See Supplementary Material .03(a) to Options 4, Section 5.\n    \\15\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    With this proposal, Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Securities \nExpirations would be treated similar to existing SPY, QQQ, and IWM \nMonday and Wednesday Expirations. With respect to standard expiration \noption series, Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Securities Expirations \nwill be permitted to expire in the same week in which standard \nexpiration option series on the same class expire.\\16\\ Not listing \nMonday and Wednesday Qualifying Securities Expirations for one week \nevery month because there was a standard options series on that same \nclass on the Friday of that week would create investor confusion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Further, as with SPY, QQQ, and IWM Monday and Wednesday \nExpirations, the Exchange would not permit Monday and Wednesday \nQualifying Securities Expirations to expire on a business day in which \nstandard expiration option series, Monthly Options Series, or Quarterly \nOptions Series expire.\\17\\ Therefore, all Monday and Wednesday \nQualifying Securities Expirations would expire at the close of business \non each of the next two Mondays and Wednesdays, respectively, that are \nbusiness days and are not business days in which standard expiration \noption series, Monthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options Series \nexpire. The Exchange believes that it is reasonable to not permit two \nexpirations on the same day in which a standard expiration option \nseries, Monthly Options Series, a Quarterly Options Series would expire \nbecause those options would be duplicative of each other.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ See Supplementary Material .03 to Options 4, Section 5.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that any market disruptions will be \nencountered with the introduction of Monday and Wednesday Qualifying \nSecurities Expirations. The Exchange currently trades P.M.-settled \nShort Term Option Series that expire Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and \nThursday on several symbols \\18\\ and has not experienced any market \ndisruptions nor issues with capacity. Today, the Exchange has \nsurveillance programs in place to support and properly monitor trading \nin Short Term Option Series that expire Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and \nThursday on several symbols.\\19\\ The Exchange believes that it has the \nnecessary capacity and surveillance programs in place to support and \nproperly monitor trading in the proposed Monday and Wednesday \nQualifying Securities Expirations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See supra note 4.\n    \\19\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImpact of Proposal\n    The Exchange notes that listings in the Short Term Option Series \nProgram comprise a significant part of the standard listings in options \nmarkets. Table 1 demonstrates the percentage of weekly listings in the \noptions industry compared to monthly, quarterly, and Long-Term Option \nSeries for a twelve-month period from February 11, 2024 to February 11, \n2025.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ The Exchange sourced this information from The Options \nClearing Corporation (``OCC''). The information includes time \naveraged data (the number of strikes by maturity date divided from \nthe number of trading days) for all 18 options markets from February \n11, 2024 to February 11, 2025.\n\n\n[[Page 21808]]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable 1\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21MY25.000\n\n    While the Exchange is expanding the Short Term Option Series \nProgram to permit Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Securities \nExpirations, the Exchange anticipates that it would overall add a small \nnumber of weekly expiration dates because the Exchange will limit the \nnumber of Qualifying Securities Expirations to two Monday expirations \nand two Wednesday expirations. If today the data were applied based on \ndata from January 2025, the following options would meet the criteria \nto be a Qualifying Security: NVIDIA Corp (``NVDA''), Tesla Inc. \n(``TSLA''), Apple Inc. (``AAPL''), <a href=\"http://Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a> Inc. (``AMZN''), Broadcom \nInc. (``AVGO''), Alphabet Inc. (``GOOGL''), Microsoft Corp (``MSFT''), \nFinancial Select Sector SPDR Fund (``XLF''), and Meta Platforms Inc. \n(``META'') (collectively ``Sample Qualifying Securities''). Utilizing \nthe Sample Qualifying Securities as a data point, expanding the Short \nTerm Option Series Program would account for the addition of \napproximately 16% of strikes for the total number of strikes for each \nof the following symbols: NVDA, TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, AVGO, GOOGL, MSFT, \nand META.\n    Further, as shown in Table 2, weeklies comprise 52% of the total \nvolume of options contracts.\\21\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ The chart represents industry volume in terms of overall \ncontracts. Weeklies comprise 52% of volume, as shown in Table 2, \nwhile only being 19% of the strikes, as shown in Table 1. The \nExchange sourced this information from OCC. The information includes \ndata for all 18 options markets from February 11, 2024 to February \n11, 2025.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 21809]]\n\nTable 2\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21MY25.001\n\nThe Exchange believes that inner weeklies (first two weeks) represent \nhigh volume as compared to outer weeklies (the last three weeks) and \nwould be more attractive to market participants.\n    The Exchange believes there is general demand for alternative \nexpirations in Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Securities Expirations \nbased on a similar analysis. In particular, the Exchange looked at the \naverage daily contracts traded in options that met the criteria for a \nQualifying Security. Specifically, for each of the Sample Qualifying \nSecurities, the Exchange looked at pre-close movements between 3:30-\n4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (``ET'') as well as post-close movements between \n4:00-5:30 p.m. ET.\n    Table 3, below, references the number of occurrences of strike \nbreaks through post close (comparing 4:00 p.m. ET to 5:30 p.m. ET) from \n2022 through 2024 for the Sample Qualifying Securities and SPY, QQQ and \nIWM.\n\nTable 3\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21MY25.002\n\n\n[[Page 21810]]\n\n\n    Table 4, below, references average annualized closing volatilities \n(as measured by the standard deviation of 30 seconds returns over the \nlast 30 minutes of trading) for the Sample Qualifying Securities from \n2022 through 2024. Table 4 shows that the Sample Qualifying Securities \nhave an average annualized closing volatility of generally less than \n20%.\n    Table 4, above, demonstrates that the Sample Qualifying Securities \nare more volatile than SPY, QQQ and IWM.\n\nTable 4\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21MY25.003\n\n    Given that these are individual stocks it is reasonable to expect \nthat they have idiosyncratic characteristics (increasing their \nvolatility) relative to broad based Exchange-Traded Fund Shares like \nSPY, QQQ and IWM. None, however, are demonstrating average returns that \nare more than double that of IWM. Moreover, on Mondays and Wednesdays \nthe Sample Qualifying Securities do not show any excessive propensity \nto penetrate strikes post close (4:00 p.m.-5:30 p.m. ET) in comparison \nto SPY, QQQ and IWM. Consequently, the burden of American-style option \n\\22\\ exercise management on investors is not overwhelming relative to \nSPY, QQQ and IWM which have the largest retail participation based on \nvolume in the industry.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ The term ``American-style option'' means an options \ncontract that, subject to the provisions of Options 6B, Section 1 \n(relating to the cutoff time for exercise instructions) and to the \nRules of the Clearing Corporation, can be exercised on any business \nday prior to its expiration date and on its expiration date. See \nOptions 1, Section 1(a)(3).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The Exchange also reviewed the number of strike breaks for calendar \nyear 2024 for the Sample Qualifying Securities between 4:00 p.m. and \n5:30 p.m. ET to find the maximum \\23\\ number of strike breaks \\24\\ as \nwell as the mean \\25\\ of the number of strike breaks as evidenced by \nTable 5.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\23\\ Maximum means the largest instance of strike breaks \nmeasured as the number of strikes crossed by the underlying security \nfrom the 4:00 p.m. ET closing price to the 9:30 a.m. ET opening \nprice.\n    \\24\\ A strike break is the existence of a strike between the \nclosing price and the opening price on the following day when there \nhas been a penetration of a strike post-close.\n    \\25\\ Mean is the average number of strike breaks when there has \nbeen a penetration of a strike post-close.\n\n                                                       Table 5--Monday, Non-Earnings

             7.13\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Because the Exchange proposes to limit the number of Monday and \nWednesday Qualifying Securities Expirations to two expirations beyond \nthe current week, the Exchange believes that the addition of these \nMonday and Wednesday Qualifying Securities Expirations should encourage \nMarket Makers to continue to deploy capital more efficiently and \nimprove displayed market quality.\\28\\ Utilizing the Sample Qualifying \nSecurities as a proxy, the marginal increase in the number of \noccurrences of strike breaks in 2024 would be sixty-six (66) with the \naddition of these parameters. Further, there would be a marginal \nincrease of twenty-two (22) instances of strike breaks in 2024 on \nMonday expiries after regular trading hours, and a marginal increase of \nforty-four (44) instances of strike breaks in 2024 on Wednesday \nexpiries without Earnings Announcements after regular trading hours.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\28\\ Market Makers include Primary Market Makers and Competitive \nMarket Makers. See Options 1, Section 1(a)(21). Today, Primary \nMarket Makers and Competitive Market Makers are required to quote a \nspecified time in their assigned options series. See Options 2, \nSection 5.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Similar to SPY, QQQ and IWM Monday and Wednesday Expirations, the \nintroduction of Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Securities Expirations \nwill, among other things, expand hedging tools available to market \nparticipants and allow for a reduced premium cost of buying portfolio \nprotection. The Exchange believes that the proposal would permit only \nthe most liquid securities to have the additional Monday and Wednesday \nQualifying Security Expirations. The Exchange believes that offering \nthese additional expiries in the Qualifying Securities would permit \nMarket Makers and other market participants to precisely hedge their \npositions in the underlying security with the additional expiries in \nlieu of hedging only with Friday expirations.\n2. Statutory Basis\n    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section \n6(b) of the Act,\\29\\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Section \n6(b)(5) of the Act,\\30\\ in particular, in that it is designed to \npromote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments \nto and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national \nmarket system, and, in general to protect investors and the public \ninterest.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\29\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).\n    \\30\\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Similar to Monday expirations in SPY, QQQ, and IWM, the proposal to \npermit Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Security Expirations, subject to \nthe proposed limitation of two expirations beyond the current week, \nwould protect investors and the public interest by providing the \ninvesting public and other market participants more choice and \nflexibility to closely tailor their investment and hedging decisions in \nthese options and allow for a reduced premium cost of buying portfolio \nprotection, thus allowing them to better manage their risk exposure. \nThe Exchange believes that there is general demand for alternative \nexpirations based on the analysis discussed above.\n    The Exchange believes that the proposed criteria for Qualifying \nSecurities requires individual stocks and Exchange-Traded Fund Shares \nto be highly liquid. A market capitalization measured on the last day \nof the prior calendar quarter based on the closing price of the \nunderlying, of greater than 700 billion dollars for an individual \nstock, or AUM of 50 billion dollars for an Exchange-Trade Fund Share, \nin conjunction with the monthly options volume requirement of greater \nthan 10 million options as measured by sides traded in the last month \npreceding the quarter end, is very restrictive. This requirement \nrepresents substantially less than 1% of individual stocks (only eight \n(8) individual stocks currently exist as of January 1, 2025) and \nsubstantially less than 1% of Exchange-Traded Fund Shares (only seven \n(7) Exchange-Traded Fund Shares currently exist as of January 1, 2025, \nof which five (5) are eligible, today, pursuant to Options 4, Section \n3, to trade additional expiries) traded.\\31\\ Therefore, an individual \nstock or Exchange-Traded Fund Share that meets aforementioned market \ncapitalization and volume requirements are highly liquid and could be \nviewed as stable securities. Table 7, below, demonstrates the very low \naverage realized volatility experienced by the Sample Qualifying \nSecurities in the last 30 minutes of trading before the close in 2024 \nas compared to any security that traded an average of more than 100 \noptions contracts per day.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\31\\ Only one (1) of the seven (7) Exchange-Traded Fund Shares \nis eligible because the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF position limit is \nrestricted at 25,000 contracts pursuant to Supplementary Material \n.01 to Options 9, Section 13, although it would otherwise qualify \nfor a higher position limit pursuant to Options 9, Section 13(d).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 21812]]\n\nTable 7\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21MY25.004\n\n    The Exchange notes that with respect to position limits, Options 9, \nSection 13(d)(5) provides, that ``[t]o be eligible for the 250,000 \ncontract limit, either the most recent six (6) month trading volume of \nthe underlying security must have totaled at least 100 million shares \nor the most recent six-month trading volume of the underlying security \nmust have totaled at least seventy-five (75) million shares and the \nunderlying security must have at least 300 million shares currently \noutstanding.'' The 250,000 contract position limit is the highest \nposition limit by Exchange rule. Options that qualify for the 250,000 \nposition (and exercise) limit are highly liquid securities that have \nmet the stringent requirements noted in Options 9, Section 13(d)(5) to \nqualify for the highest position limit.\n    Finally, a Qualifying Security must participate in the Penny \nInterval Program. In order to qualify for the Penny Interval Program, \nan options class must be among the 300 most actively traded multiply \nlisted option classes overlying securities priced below $200.\\32\\ The \nmost actively traded options classes are included in the Penny Interval \nProgram based on certain objective criteria (trading volume thresholds \nand initial price tests).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\32\\ See Supplementary Material .01(b) to Options 3, Section 3. \nEach December OCC ranks all multiply listed option classes based on \nNational Cleared Volume for the six full calendar months from June 1 \nthrough November 30 for determination of the most actively traded \noption classes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The number of individual stocks currently meeting all four criteria \nfor a Qualifying Security is eight (8) and the number of Exchange-\nTraded Fund Shares currently meeting all four criteria for a Qualifying \nSecurity that do not already have Monday and Wednesday expirations is \none (1). Both totals represent less than 0.2% of all securities with \noptions listed. The Exchange believes that since individual stocks are \nthe dominant constituents of the broad-based indexes (e.g., S&P 500 \nIndex and Nasdaq-100 Index), the improvement in price transparency \nbrought about by Monday and Wednesday trading will offer Market Makers \nand investors better volatility pricing which will inform trading on \nthe related products to these indexes. The Exchange believes that the \nproposed criteria for Qualifying Securities is consistent with the \nprotection of investors and the general public because the criteria \ntargets the most liquid individual stocks and Exchange-Traded Fund \nShares.\n    The Exchange would not list an expiry on a Qualifying Security on a \nday where there will be an Earnings Announcement that takes place after \nmarket close to avoid post-close price volatility that may arise from \nthe Earnings Announcement and which may impact exercise and/or \nassignment decisions.\n    Qualifying Securities that do not continue to meet the above \ncriteria would no longer be permitted to list Monday and Wednesday \nexpiries in the following quarter, although the Qualifying Security \nwould potentially have two weeks of strikes already listed which will \npersist. These remaining listings could continue to be traded until \nthey expire.\n    With this proposal, overall, the Exchange would add a small number \nof Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Security Expirations by limiting the \naddition of two Monday expirations and two Wednesday expirations beyond \nthe current week. The addition of Monday and Wednesday Qualifying \nSecurity Expirations would remove impediments to and perfect the \nmechanism of a free and open market by encouraging Market Makers to \ncontinue to deploy capital more efficiently and improve displayed \nmarket quality.\\33\\ The Exchange believes that the proposal will allow \nMembers to expand hedging tools and tailor their investment and hedging \nneeds more effectively in Qualifying Securities as these funds are most \nlikely to be utilized by market participants to hedge the underlying \nasset classes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\33\\ Today, Primary Market Makers and Market Makers are required \nto quote a specified time in their assigned options series. See \nOptions 2, Section 5.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Similar to SPY, QQQ, and IWM Monday and Wednesday Expirations, the \nintroduction of Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Security Expirations is \nconsistent with the Act as\n\n[[Page 21813]]\n\nit will, among other things, expand hedging tools available to market \nparticipants and allow for a reduced premium cost of buying portfolio \nprotection. The Exchange believes that Monday and Wednesday Qualifying \nSecurity Expirations will allow market participants to purchase options \non Qualifying Securities based on their timing as needed and allow them \nto tailor their investment and hedging needs more effectively, thus \nallowing them to better manage their risk exposure. Today, ISE lists \nother Monday and Wednesday expirations.\\34\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\34\\ See ISE Supplementary Material .03 at Options 4, Section 5 \nat Table 1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In particular, the Exchange believes the Short Term Option Series \nProgram has been successful to date and that Monday and Wednesday \nQualifying Security Expirations should simply expand the ability of \ninvestors to hedge risk against market movements stemming from economic \nreleases or market events that occur throughout the month in the same \nway that the Short Term Option Series Program has expanded the \nlandscape of hedging.\n    There are no material differences in the treatment of SPY, QQQ and \nIWM Monday and Wednesday Expirations compared to the proposed Monday \nand Wednesday Qualifying Security Expirations. Given the similarities \nbetween SPY, QQQ and IWM Monday and Wednesday Expirations and the \nproposed Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Security Expirations, the \nExchange believes that applying the provisions in Supplementary \nMaterial .03 to Options 4, Section 5 that currently apply to SPY, QQQ \nand IWM Monday and Wednesday Expirations is justified.\n    ISE represents that it has an adequate surveillance program in \nplace to detect manipulative trading in the proposed option \nexpirations, in the same way that it monitors trading in the current \nShort Term Option Series for Monday SPY, QQQ and IWM expirations. The \nExchange also represents that it has the necessary system capacity to \nsupport the new expirations. Finally, the Exchange does not believe \nthat any market disruptions will be encountered with the introduction \nof these option expirations. As discussed above, the Exchange believes \nthat its proposal is a modest expansion of weekly expiration dates for \nMonday and Wednesday Qualifying Security Expirations given that it will \nbe limited to two Monday expirations and two Wednesday expirations \nbeyond the current week.\n\nB. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition\n\n    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will \nimpose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate \nin furtherance of the purposes of the Act.\n    While the proposal will expand the Short Term Options Expirations \nto allow Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Security Expirations to be \nlisted on ISE,\\35\\ the Exchange believes that this limited expansion \nfor Monday and Wednesday expirations for options on Qualifying \nSecurities will not impose an undue burden on competition; rather, it \nwill meet customer demand. The Exchange would uniformly apply the \nQualifying Security criteria to options in individual stocks and \nExchange-Traded Fund Shares. The Exchange believes that Members will \ncontinue to be able to expand hedging tools and tailor their investment \nand hedging needs more effectively in the Qualifying Securities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\35\\ As noted above, Nasdaq, Phlx, BX, GEMX and MRX incorporate \nISE Options 4, Section 5 by reference, so the proposed changes \nherein will apply to those markets as well.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Similar to SPY, QQQ and IWM Monday and Wednesday Expirations, the \nintroduction of Monday and Wednesday Qualifying Security Expirations \ndoes not impose an undue burden on competition. The Exchange believes \nthat it will, among other things, expand the hedging tools available to \nmarket participants and allow for a reduced premium cost of buying \nportfolio protection. The Exchange believes that Monday and Wednesday \nQualifying Security Expirations will allow market participants to \npurchase options on Qualifying Securities based on their timing as \nneeded and allow them to tailor their investment and hedging needs more \neffectively.\n    Further, not adding an expiry for a Qualifying Security on a day \nwhere there will be an Earnings Announcement that takes place after \nmarket close does not impose an undue burden on competition as the \nExchange would uniformly apply this practice to the listing of all \nQualifying Securities.\n    The Exchange does not believe the proposal will impose any burden \non inter-market competition, as nothing prevents other options \nexchanges from proposing similar rules to list and trade Monday and \nWednesday Qualifying Security Expirations. Further, the Exchange does \nnot believe the proposal will impose any burden on intra-market \ncompetition, as all market participants will be treated in the same \nmanner under this proposal.\n\nC. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed \nRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others\n\n    No written comments were either solicited or received.\n\nIII. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for \nCommission Action\n\n    Within 45 days of the date of publication of this notice in the \nFederal Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the \nCommission may designate if it finds such longer period to be \nappropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to \nwhich the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will:\n    (A) by order approve or disapprove such proposed rule change, or\n    (B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule \nchange should be disapproved.\n\nIV.

The Commission uses the \ninformation for enforcement inquiries or investigations and trading \nreconstructions, as well as for inspections and examinations.\n    The Commission estimates that it sends approximately 10,807 \nelectronic blue sheet requests per year to clearing broker-dealers that \nin turn submit an average 213,233 responses.\\1\\ It is estimated that \neach broker-dealer that responds electronically will take 8 minutes, \nand each broker-dealer that responds manually will take 1\\1/2\\ hours to \nprepare and submit the securities trading data requested by the \nCommission. The annual aggregate hour burden for electronic and manual \nresponses from all firms is estimated to be 28,562 (213,137 x 8 / 60 = \n28,418 hours) + (96 x 1.5 = 144 hours), respectively.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ A single EBS request has a unique number assigned to it \n(e.g., ``0900001''). However, the number of broker-dealer \nsubmissions transmitted in response to one EBS request can range \nfrom one to thousands. EBS requests are sent directly to clearing \nfirms, as the clearing firm is the repository for trading data for \nsecurities transactions information provided by the clearing firm \nand the correspondent firms. Clearing brokers respond for themselves \nand other firms for which they clear. There were 426,274 responses \nduring the 24-month period, for an average of 213,137 annual \nresponses.\n    \\2\\ Few respondents submit manual EBS responses. The small \npercentage of respondents that submit manual responses do so by \nhand, via email, spreadsheet, disk, or other electronic media. Thus, \nthe number of manual submissions (approximately 96 per year) has \nminimal effect on the total annual burden hours.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required \nto respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a \ncurrently valid OMB Control Number.\n    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed \ncollection of information is necessary for the proper performance of \nthe functions of the SEC, including whether the information will have \npractical utility; (b) the accuracy of the SEC's estimate of the burden \nimposed by the proposed collection of information, including the \nvalidity of the methodology and the assumptions used; (c) ways to \nenhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be \ncollected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of \ninformation on respondents, including through the use of automated, \nelectronic collection techniques or other forms of information \ntechnology.\n    Please direct your written comment to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief \nData Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Tanya Ruttenberg, \n100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 and send it by email to \n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#81d1e0f1e4f3f6eef3ead3e4e5f4e2f5e8eeefc0e2f5c1f2e4e2afe6eef7\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"2a7a4b5a4f585d455841784f4e5f495e4345446b495e6a594f49044d455c\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, by July 21, 2025.\n\n    Dated: May 16, 2025.\nSherry R.

The Privacy Act applies \nto records about individuals that are maintained in a ``system of \nrecords.'' A system of records is any group of records under the \ncontrol of a federal agency from which information is retrieved by the \nname of an individual or by a number, symbol or any other identifier \nassigned to the individual. The Privacy Act requires each federal \nagency to publish a system of records notice (SORN) in the Federal \nRegister identifying and describing: (1) each system of record the \nagency maintains, (2) the purpose for which the agency uses personally \nidentifiable information (PII) in the system, (3) the routine uses for \nwhich the agency discloses such information outside the agency, and (4) \nhow individuals can exercise their rights related to their PII \ninformation.\n    The SBA is required to complete background investigations for \nsuitability and security clearance determinations to ensure individuals \nsupporting the Agency are deemed reliable, trustworthy, and suitable \nfor the role they will fulfill. The Agency's Office of Personnel \nSecurity utilizes the Automated Background Investigation System (ABIS), \na commercial off the shelf (COTS) web-based system, to support the \ncollection of data that is used by the Bureau to initiate background \ninvestigations.\n    This system of records is comprised of electronic documents managed \nby the Office of Personnel Security and the Office of the Chief \nInformation Officer.\n\nSYSTEM NAME AND NUMBER:\n    Automated Background Investigation System Personnel Security Files \n(SBA ABIS PSF 24).\n\nSECURITY CLASSIFICATION:\n    Controlled Unclassified Information.\n\nSYSTEM LOCATION:\n    SBA Headquarters, 409 3rd Street SW, Washington, DC.\n\nSYSTEM MANAGER(S):\n    Joseph L.

SpaceX must obtain a new license or modification \nof its existing vehicle operator license from the FAA to operate the \nStarship-Super Heavy Flight 9 mission profile. The federal action also \nincludes the FAA's issuance of temporary airspace closures. Based on \nthe safety analysis for Starship-Super Heavy Flight 9, an Aircraft \nHazard Area and associated Notice to Airmen would necessitate FAA to \nclose airspace over a portion of the Bahamas and the Turks & Caicos \nIslands. Starship-Super Heavy Flight 9 will impact air routes extending \neastward from the Boca Chica launch site through the Straits of \nFlorida, covering approximately 1,600 nautical miles. The designated \nAircraft Hazard Area will necessitate the closure of more than 70 \nairways (established aircraft routes) across the Gulf of America and \nnow, due to vehicle reliability, include the Lucayan Archipelago \n(Bahamas and Turks & Caicos Islands). Bahamas and Turks & Caicos are \nexpected to close their respective airspace up to 6,000 feet and FAA \nwill close the airspace above that. This is an update to the existing \noperations involving the Starship-Super Heavy described in the April \n2025 Tiered EA.\n    The FAA has posted the Tiered EA and FONSI/ROD on the FAA Office of \nCommercial Space Transportation website: <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/\">https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/</a>.\n\n    Issued in Washington, DC, on: May 15, 2025.\nStacey Molinich Zee,\nManager, Operations Support Branch.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09079 Filed 5-20-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4910-13-P\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"

FRA assigned the \npetition Docket Number FRA-2015-0084.\n    Specifically, SEPTA requests an extension of the relief required to \ncontinue its participation in FRA's C\\3\\RS Program. SEPTA seeks to \ncontinue shielding reporting employees from mandatory punitive \nsanctions that would otherwise arise as provided in Sec. Sec.  \n240.117(e)(1) through (4); 240.305(a)(1)through (4) and (a)(6); \n240.307; 242.403(b), (c), (e)(1) through (4), (e)(6) through (11), \n(f)(1) and (2); and 242.407. The C\\3\\RS Program encourages certified \noperating crew members to report close calls and protects the employees \nand the railroad from discipline or sanctions arising from the \nincidents reported per the C\\3\\RS Implementing Memorandum of \nUnderstanding (IMOU). The IMOU includes the Brotherhood of Locomotive \nEngineers and Trainmen and the Transportation Division of SMART-TD.\n    In support of its request, SEPTA states that it has made many \nsafety improvements since the waiver was last extended, including \nreviewing 183 close call submissions; developing a ``Shop Movement Job \nBrief Form,'' which has reduced incidents in shop movements; and \nbeginning a campaign to ensure equipment has proper inspection \npaperwork and testing before leaving initial terminals.\n    A copy of the petition, as well as any written communications \nconcerning the petition, is available for review online at \n<a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>.\n    Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings \nby submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate \nscheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since \nthe facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party \ndesires an opportunity for oral comment and a public hearing, they \nshould notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and \nspecify the basis for their request.\n    Communications received by June 20, 2025, will be considered by FRA \nbefore final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be \nconsidered if practicable.\n\nPrivacy Act\n\n    Anyone can search the electronic form of any written communications \nand comments received into any of FRA's dockets by the name of the \nindividual submitting the comment (or signing the document, if \nsubmitted on behalf of an association, business, labor union, etc.). \nUnder 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments from the public to inform \nits processes.

Proc. 2023-20 (2023-15 I.R.B. \n636), requesting that nonene be added to the list of taxable substances \nunder section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (List). The petition \nrequesting the addition of nonene to the List is based on weight and \ncontains the information detailed in paragraph (b) of this document. \nThe information is provided for public notice and comment pursuant to \nsection 9 of Rev.

The publication of petition \ninformation in this notice of filing is not a determination and does \nnot constitute Treasury Department or IRS confirmation of the accuracy \nof the information published.\n    (b) Petition Content.\n    (1) Substance name: Nonene.\n    (2) Petitioner: Exxon Mobil Corporation, an exporter of nonene.\n    (3) Proposed classification numbers:\n    (i) HTSUS number: 2901.29.50.00.\n    (ii) Schedule B number: 2901.29.6000.\n    (iii) CAS number: 68526-55-63.\n    (4) Petition filing dates:\n    (i) Petition filing date for purposes of making a determination: \nMay 1, 2025.\n    (ii) Petition filing date for purposes of section 11.02 of Rev. \nProc. 2022-26, as modified by section 3 of Rev. Proc. 2023-20: July 1, \n2022.\n    (5) Description from petition: Nonene is a reactive intermediates \nused to manufacture products used in lube oil additives, surfactants, \nagricultural chemicals, coatings and corrosion inhibitors.\n    Nonene is made from propylene and amylene. Taxable chemicals \nconstitute 90.5 percent by weight of the materials used to produce this \nsubstance.\n\n[[Page 21827]]\n\n    (6) Process identified in petition as predominant method of \nproduction of substance: The name of the production process that the \npetitioner has identified as the predominant method of production of \nthe substance is Oligomerization.\n    Nonene (C<INF>9</INF>H<INF>18</INF>) and tetramer \n(C<INF>12</INF>H<INF>24</INF>) are olefins that are obtained by \noligomerization of feedstock that contains propylene. Each product \nactually contains several isomeric olefins with varying degrees of \nbranching and different positions of the olefinic double bond. \nRefinery-generated propylene is of sufficient quality to be used as the \nfeedstock material. The most common process initiates the reaction with \na supported phosphoric acid catalyst at temperatures ranging from 120 \n[deg]C to 225 [deg]C.

Peeples at (202) 317-6855 \n(not a toll-free number).\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nRequest To Add Substance to the List\n\n    (a) Overview. A petition was filed pursuant to Rev. Proc. 2022-26 \n(2022-29 I.R.B. 90), as modified by Rev. Proc. 2023-20 (2023-15 I.R.B. \n636), requesting that tri-isononyl tri-mellitate be added to the list \nof taxable substances under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue \nCode (List). The petition requesting the addition of tri-isononyl tri-\nmellitate to the List is based on weight and contains the information \ndetailed in paragraph (b) of this document. The information is provided \nfor public notice and comment pursuant to section 9 of Rev. Proc. 2022-\n26. The publication of petition information in this notice of filing is \nnot a determination and does not constitute Treasury Department or IRS \nconfirmation of the accuracy of the information published.\n    (b) Petition Content.\n    (1) Substance name: Tri-isononyl tri-mellitate.\n    (2) Petitioner: Exxon Mobil Corporation, an exporter of tri-\nisononyl tri-mellitate.\n    (3) Proposed classification numbers:\n    (i) HTSUS number: 2917.39.20.00.\n    (ii) Schedule B number: 2917.39.2000.\n    (iii) CAS number: 53894-23-8.\n    (4) Petition filing dates:\n    (i) Petition filing date for purposes of making a determination: \nMay 1, 2025.\n    (ii) Petition filing date for purposes of section 11.02 of Rev. \nProc. 2022-26, as modified by section 3 of Rev. Proc. 2023-20: July 1, \n2022.\n    (5) Description from petition: Tri-isononyl tri-mellitate is a \nplasticizer used in automotive interiors, as well as wire and cable \napplications, that require resistance to very high temperatures, \nmigration and extraction resistance over long durations.\n    Tri-isononyl tri-mellitate is made from propylene, amylene, carbon \nmonoxide, hydrogen, and trimellitic anhydride. Taxable chemicals \nconstitute 47.3 percent by weight of the materials used to produce this \nsubstance.\n    (6) Process identified in petition as predominant method of \nproduction of substance: The predominant method of producing tri-\nisononyl tri-mellitate is via Esterification.\n    This process can be readily carried out in heated kettles with \nagitation and provision for water takeoff. Esterification catalysts \n(e.g., sulfuric acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid) speed the reaction and \nare neutralized, washed, and then removed. The purity requirements for \ncommercial plasticizers are very high; phthalate esters are usually \ncolorless and are mostly odorless. In the case of phthalates, the \nesterification is carried out through the reaction of phthalic \nanhydride and 2-ethylhexanol to produce dioctyl phthalate (DOP).\n    This reaction usually requires an excess of alcohol, which is \nreadily recycled. Analogous syntheses yield aliphatic dicarboxylic acid \nesters, benzoates, and trimellitates.\n\n[[Page 21828]]\n\n    The tri-isononyl tri-mellitate tri-ester is made by reacting \nprimary isononyl (C9) alcohol with trimellitic anhydride. The ester is \nproduced by esterification of 3 moles of isononyl C9 alcohol and 1 mole \nof trimellitic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst.\n    By using excess alcohol (up to 30% molar excess of C9 alcohol) and \nremoving the water, the equilibrium is shifted towards the formation of \nthe tri-ester. The reactants are charged into a reactor and heated up. \nThe reaction rate is accelerated by using, for example, tetra-n-butyl \ntitanate introduced at high temperature (140[deg]C--250[deg]C), while \nremoving the water formed.\n    Excess alcohol is distilled from the ester by vacuum prior to \nneutralization and recycled into subsequent batches. The final ester is \npurified by neutralizing with a base such as an aqueous solution of \nsodium carbonate. The remaining excess water is distilled off and the \nester is then filtered using filter agents. The degree of purity of the \nester is min 99.0 wt%.\n    (7) Stoichiometric material consumption equation, based on process \nidentified as predominant method of production:\n\n7.22 C<INF>3</INF>H<INF>6</INF> [propylene] + 0.46 \nC<INF>5</INF>H<INF>10</INF> [amylene] + 3 CO [carbon monoxide] + 6 \nH<INF>2</INF> [hydrogen] + C<INF>9</INF>H<INF>4</INF>O<INF>5</INF> \n[trimellitic anhydride] [rarr] \nC<INF>36</INF>H<INF>60</INF>O<INF>6</INF> [tri-isononyl trimellitate] + \n2 H<INF>2</INF>O [water]\n\n    (8) Tax rate calculated by Petitioner, based on Petitioner's \nconversion factors for taxable chemicals used in production of \nsubstance:\n    (i) Tax rate: $5.06 per ton.\n    (ii) Conversion factors: 0.52 for propylene.\n    (9) Public docket number: IRS-2025-0057.\n\nMichael Beker,\nSenior Counsel (Energy, Credits, and Excise Tax), IRS Office of Chief \nCounsel.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09133 Filed 5-20-25; 8:45 am]\nBILLING CODE 4830-01-P\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"

This week and \n                always, we honor the courageous men and women serving \n                in law enforcement and memorialize those who sacrificed \n                their lives defending the thin blue line.\n\n                A nation in chaos ceases to be a citadel of liberty. \n                Tragically, the previous administration allowed \n                lawlessness to permeate our country, making it harder \n                for our law enforcement officers to do their jobs. \n                Their reckless, soft-on-crime policies emboldened \n                criminals and thugs; wreaked havoc on the sanctity of \n                our homes, businesses, and public spaces; instilled \n                fear; and jeopardized public trust.\n\n                As your 47th President, I am fulfilling my promise to \n                make America safe again by reclaiming sovereignty on \n                the border and restoring the rule of law in communities \n                nationwide. We will utilize every available means to \n                equip and train law enforcement, retain qualified \n                officers, and recruit on the basis of meritocracy.\n\n                The oath to serve and protect comes with extraordinary \n                risk and sacrifice, and we are indebted to those who \n                choose this righteous profession. That is why I have \n                asked the Congress to codify my Executive Order \n                mandating the death penalty for the murder of a police \n                officer--sending an unequivocal message that barbaric \n                acts of violence and blatant disregard for the lives of \n                our Nation's heroes will not be tolerated--and to pass \n                a crime bill with enhanced protections for police \n                officers.\n\n                I stand in steadfast solidarity with those who defend \n                our freedoms and the families who love and support \n                them. We pray for those who grieve the fallen and \n                pledge that their lives, legacies, and sacrifices will \n                forever be remembered by our grateful Nation.\n\n                By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as \n                amended (Public Law 87-726, 76 Stat. 676), and by \n                Public Law 105-225 (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President \n                has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 \n                of each year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the \n                week in which it falls as ``Police Week.''\n\n                NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

(IEEPA), the \n                National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), \n                section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 \n                U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States \n                Code, I hereby determine and order:\n\n                Section 1. Background. In Executive Order 14257 of \n                April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal \n                Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to \n                Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade \n                Deficits), I declared a national emergency arising from \n                conditions reflected in large and persistent annual \n                U.S. goods trade deficits, and imposed additional ad \n                valorem duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate \n                to deal with that unusual and extraordinary threat, \n                which has its source in whole or substantial part \n                outside the United States, to the national security and \n                economy of the United States. Section 4(b) of Executive \n                Order 14257 provided that ``[s]hould any trading \n                partner retaliate against the United States in response \n                to this action through import duties on U.S. exports or \n                other measures, I may further modify the [Harmonized \n                Tariff Schedule of the United States] to increase or \n                expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to \n                ensure the efficacy of this action.''\n\n                In Executive Order 14259 of April 8, 2025 (Amendment to \n                Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to \n                Low-Value Imports From the People's Republic of China), \n                and Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025 (Modifying \n                Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Trading Partner \n                Retaliation and Alignment), pursuant to section 4(b) of \n                Executive Order 14257, I ordered modifications of the \n                Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) \n                to raise the applicable ad valorem duty rate for \n                imports from the People's Republic of China (PRC) \n                established in Executive Order 14257, in recognition of \n                the fact that the State Council Tariff Commission of \n                the PRC announced that it would retaliate against the \n                United States in response to Executive Order 14257 and \n                Executive Order 14259.\n\n                Section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257 provided that, \n                ``[s]hould any trading partner take significant steps \n                to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align \n                sufficiently with the United States on economic and \n                national security matters, I may further modify the \n                HTSUS to decrease or limit in scope the duties imposed \n                under this order.'' Since I signed Executive Order \n                14266, the United States has entered into discussions \n                with the PRC to address the lack of trade reciprocity \n                in our economic relationship and our resulting national \n                and economic security concerns. Conducting these \n                discussions is a significant step by the PRC toward \n                remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and \n                addressing the concerns of the United States relating \n                to economic and national security matters.\n\n                Pursuant to section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257, I \n                have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to \n                address the national emergency declared in that order \n                by modifying the HTSUS to suspend for a period of 90 \n                days application of the additional ad valorem duties \n                imposed on the PRC listed in Annex I to Executive Order \n                14257, as amended by Executive Order\n\n[[Page 21832]]\n\n                14259 and Executive Order 14266, and clarified in the \n                Presidential Memorandum of April 11, 2025 \n                (Clarification of Exceptions Under Executive Order \n                14257 of April 2, 2025, as Amended), and to instead \n                impose on articles of the PRC an additional ad valorem \n                rate of duty as set forth herein, pursuant to the terms \n                of, and except as otherwise provided in, Executive \n                Order 14257, as modified by this order.\n\n                Sec. 2. Suspension of Country-Specific Ad Valorem Rate \n                of Duty. Effective with respect to goods entered for \n                consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for \n                consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight \n                time on May 14, 2025, all articles imported into the \n                customs territory of the United States from the PRC, \n                including Hong Kong and Macau, shall be, consistent \n                with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of \n                duty of 10 percent subject to all applicable exceptions \n                set forth in Executive Order 14257 and the Presidential \n                Memorandum of April 11, 2025. This ad valorem rate of \n                duty of 10 percent reflects (i) the modification of the \n                application of the additional ad valorem rate of duty \n                on articles of China (including articles of Hong Kong \n                and Macau) set forth in Executive Order 14257, by \n                suspending 24 percentage points of that rate for an \n                initial period of 90 days, and the retention of the \n                remaining ad valorem rate of 10 percent on those \n                articles pursuant to the terms of said order; and (ii) \n                the removal of the modified additional ad valorem rates \n                of duty on those articles imposed by Executive Order \n                14259 and Executive Order 14266.\n\n                Sec. 3. Tariff Modifications. In recognition of the \n                intentions of the PRC to facilitate addressing the \n                national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, \n                the HTSUS shall be modified as follows:\n\n                Effective with respect to goods entered for \n                consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for \n                consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight \n                time on May 14, 2025:\n\n                    (a) heading 9903.01.25 of the HTSUS shall be \n                amended by deleting the article description and by \n                inserting ``Articles the product of any country, except \n                for products described in headings 9903.01.26-\n                9903.01.33, and except as provided for in heading \n                9903.01.34, as provided for in subdivision (v) of U.S. \n                note 2 to this subchapter . . . . . .

De Minimis Tariff Decrease. To ensure that the \n                reduction in duties pursuant to section 2 of this order \n                is made fully effective and the purpose of Executive \n                Order 14257, as amended, is not undermined, I also deem \n                it necessary and appropriate to:\n\n                    (a) decrease the ad valorem rate of duty set forth \n                in section 2(c)(i) of Executive Order 14256 of April 2, \n                2025 (Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the \n                Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People's Republic \n                of China as Applied to Low-Value Imports), as modified \n                by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266, \n                from 120 percent to 54 percent;\n                    (b) retain in effect the per postal item containing \n                goods duty of 100 dollars in section 2(c)(ii) of \n                Executive Order 14256, as modified by Executive Order \n                14259 and Executive Order 14266, that has been in \n                effect since 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 2, \n                2025, unless and until otherwise modified by a \n                subsequent executive action, notwithstanding the \n                increase contemplated effective June 1, 2025, pursuant \n                to Executive Order 14256, as modified by Executive \n                Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266; and\n\n[[Page 21833]]\n\n                    (c) modify the HTSUS, effective with respect to \n                goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from \n                warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. \n                eastern daylight time on May 14, 2025, as follows:\n\n(i) subdivision (w) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the \nHTSUS shall be amended by deleting ``120 percent'', and by inserting ``54 \npercent'' in lieu thereof; and\n\n(ii) subdivision (w) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the \nHTSUS shall be amended by deleting ``, and before 12:01 a.m. eastern \ndaylight time on June 1, 2025.

Section 3(c) of Executive Order 14168 of January 20, 2025 \n(Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring \nBiological Truth to the Federal Government), requires Federal agencies \nto use the term ``sex'' and not ``gender'' in all applicable agency \npolicies and documents. In compliance with this section of the \nExecutive order, this technical amendment replaces the term ``gender'' \nwith ``sex'' wherever it appears in TSA's regulations.\n    Table 1 identifies the context for each change in 6 CFR part 37\n\n                   Table 1--Revisions to 6 CFR Part 37\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Description of\n           Section                 regulatory       Specific terminology\n                                   requirement             change\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n37.17(c)....................

TSA is \ncontinuing to assess its need for, and use of, information that \nidentifies sex. Specific use cases will be addressed separately from \nthe technical amendments in this rulemaking.\n    The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(B)(3)(b)) \nprovides that when an agency for good cause finds that notice and \npublic procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the \npublic interest, an agency may issue a rule without providing notice \nand an opportunity for public comment. TSA has determined that there is \ngood cause for making this technical amendment final without prior \nproposal and opportunity for\n\n[[Page 21690]]\n\ncomment because the revisions are not substantive and will have no \nimpact on the regulatory requirements in the affected parts. TSA has \ndetermined that public comment on such administrative changes is \nunnecessary and that there is good cause under the APA for proceeding \nwith a final rule.\n    TSA has also determined that this rule is exempt from the notice \nand comment requirement under the APA because it is a rule of agency \norganization, procedure, or practice. (See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)) Because \nthe rule is simply an administrative change that replaces terminology \nwithout altering the rights or interests of parties, it has no \nsubstantive effect on the regulatory requirements and places no stamp \nof approval or disapproval on any type of behavior. Accordingly, TSA is \nissuing this rule in its final form as a procedural rule.\n    Further, because a notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity \nfor public comment are not required for this rule under the APA or any \nother law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) are not applicable. Accordingly, this rule \nis issued in final form.\n    Before a rule can take effect, the Congressional Review Act (CRA), \nas codified at 5 U.S.C. 801-808, requires Federal agencies to submit \nthe rule and a report to Congress and the Comptroller General \nindicating whether it is a major rule. Under 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(C), rules \nof agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not \nsubstantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties \nare not considered rules for the purposes of the CRA. This technical \namendment is a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that \nwill not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency \nparties. Thus, TSA is not required to submit the rule for review under \nthe CRA.\n\nList of Subjects\n\n6 CFR Part 37\n\n    Classified information, Freedom of information, Licensing and \nregistration, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles, Personally-\nidentifiable information, Privacy, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements, Security measures.\n\n49 CFR Part 1500\n\n    Air carriers, Air transportation, Aircraft, Airports, Buses, \nHazardous materials transportation, Law enforcement officers, Maritime \ncarriers, Mass transportation, Railroad safety, Railroads, Reporting \nand recordkeeping requirements, Security measures, Transportation, \nVessels.\n\n49 CFR Part 1540\n\n    Air carriers, Airports, Aviation safety, Law enforcement officers, \nReporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures.\n\n49 CFR Part 1560\n\n    Air transportation, Law enforcement officers, Reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements, Security measures.\n\n49 CFR Part 1572\n\n    Crime, Explosives, Hazardous materials transportation, Motor \ncarriers, Railroads, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security \nmeasures.\n\nThe Amendments\n\n    For the reasons stated in the preamble, the Transportation Security \nAdministration amends chapter I of title 6, and chapter XII of title \n49, Code of Federal Regulations, as follows:\n\nPART 37--REAL ID DRIVER'S LICENSES AND IDENTIFICATION CARDS\n\n0\n1.

Code sentences that have been aggregated \nby the U.S. Bureau of Prisons (``mixed code'' offenders) and considered \nfor parole on the basis of a single parole eligibility and mandatory \nrelease date on the aggregate sentence.\n\nDATES: This regulation is effective May 21, 2025.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Helen Krapels, General Counsel, U.S. \nParole Commission, 90 K Street NE, Third Floor, Washington, DC 20530, \ntelephone (202) 346-7031. Questions about this publication are welcome, \nbut\n\n[[Page 21694]]\n\ninquiries concerning individual cases cannot be answered over the \ntelephone.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 28 CFR 2.65 pertains to the procedure for \nconsidering ``mixed code'' cases, i.e., offenders serving D.C. Code and \nU.S. Code sentences that the U.S. Bureau of Prisons has aggregated into \none sentence. As a result of the D.C. Circuit Court's ruling in Ford v. \nMassarone, 902 F.3d 309 (D.C. Cir. 2018), and the limited number of \ncases that this regulation would apply to, the U.S. Parole Commission \nhas decided to remove 28 CFR 2.65. In Ford, the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals found that the prisoner with an aggregate federal and District \nof Columbia sentence was entitled to have his initial D.C. parole \nhearing on the date he had served his minimum D.C. sentence, rather \nthan shortly before his subsequent projected federal parole date, even \nthough the prisoner would need to remain in prison on his federal \nsentence until his federal parole date. By removing 28 CFR 2.65, the \nU.S. Parole Commission will schedule ``mixed code'' prisoners for their \ninitial parole hearing based on the parole eligibility date of their \naggregate sentence as calculated by the Bureau of Prisons. The U.S. \nParole Commission will evaluate whether the prisoner should be paroled \nunder both federal and D.C. code parole statutes and regulations. To \naddress any remaining ``mixed code'' prisoners, detailed guidance will \nbe provided to agency staff as to the procedures noted in Ford v. \nMassarone.\n    Because this is a procedural rule, the matter was voted on \nseriatim.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866, 13563 and 14219\n\n    This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with \nExecutive Order 12866, ``Regulation Planning and Review,'' section \n1(b), Principles of Regulation; Executive Order 13565, ``Improving \nRegulation and Regulatory Review,'' section 1(b), General Principles of \nRegulation; and Executive Order 14219, ``Ensuring Lawful Governance and \nImplementing the President's `Department of Government Efficiency' \nDeregulatory Initiative.'' The Commission has determined that this rule \nis not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, \nsection 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule \nhas not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nExecutive Order 13132\n\n    This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, \non the relationship between the national government and the States, or \non the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various \nlevels of government. Under Executive Order 13132, this rule does not \nhave sufficient federalism implications requiring a Federalism \nAssessment.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    This rule will not have a significant economic impact upon a \nsubstantial number of small entities within the meaning of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b).\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n    This rule will not cause State, local, or tribal governments, or \nthe private sector, to spend $100,000,000 or more in any one year, and \nit will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. No \naction under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 is necessary.\n\nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Subtitle \nE--Congressional Review Act)\n\n    This rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined by Section 804 of the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 Subtitle E--\nCongressional Review Act, now codified at 5 U.S.C. 804(2). The rule \nwill not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or \nmore; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse \neffects on the ability of United States-based companies to compete with \nforeign-based companies. Moreover, this is a rule of agency practice or \nprocedure that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations \nof non-agency parties, and does not come within the meaning of the term \n``rule'' as used in Section 804(3)(C), now codified at 5 U.S.C. \n804(3)(C). Therefore, the reporting requirement of 5 U.S.C. 801 does \nnot apply.\n\nList of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 2\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Prisoners, Probation and \nparole.\n\nThe Final Rule\n\n    Accordingly, the U.S. Parole Commission is amending 28 CFR part 2 \nto read as follows:\n\nPART 2--PAROLE, RELEASE, SUPERVISION AND RECOMMITMENT OF PRISONERS, \nYOUTH OFFENDERS, AND JUVENILE DELINQUENTS\n\n0\n1.

Background Information and Regulatory History\n\n    The Manitowoc River is 35.8 miles long and flows into Lake Michigan \nat the town of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Large commercial vessels, along \nwith powered and unpowered recreational vessels, use the navigable \nportion of the river that extends from the mouth of the river to the \nhead of navigation at mile 2.33. There are two movable bridges over the \nriver.\n    The Eighth Street Bridge, mile 0.29 is a double leaf bascule bridge \nthat provides a horizontal clearance of 120 feet and a vertical \nclearance of 12 feet above LWD in the closed position and an unlimited \nclearance in the open position.\n    The Tenth Street Bridge, mile 0.43, is a double leaf bascule bridge \nthat provides a horizontal clearance of 120 feet and a vertical \nclearance of 14 feet above LWD in the closed position and an unlimited \nclearance in the open position.\n    Both bridges over the Manitowoc River have operated under a special \nregulation (33 CFR 117.1089) since 1920, with the last modernization to \nthe regulation occurring in 1955. Since the last review, there have \nbeen several important changes to commerce on the river. Specifically, \nthe Wisconsin Central Railroad Bascule Bridge and the Wisconsin Central \nRailroad Swing Bridge that previously crossed the river have been \nremoved in their entirety. Additionally, the three ferries operated by \nrailroad companies have stopped servicing Manitowoc, Wisconsin.\n    The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary interim rule without \nprior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under 5 \nU.S.C. 553(b). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule \nwithout prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for \ngood cause finds that those procedures are ``impracticable, \nunnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' Under 5 U.S.C. \n553(b), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing \na notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to this rule because it is \ncontrary to the public interest to delay the issuance of the rule and \nthe beneficial impacts it provides to the local community and users of \nthe waterway. The bridge is currently only required to remain closed to \nnavigation for short 10-minute periods during commuting hours causing \nhigh vehicle congestion. This temporary operating schedule adjusts the \ndesignated drawbridge opening times to assist with vehicle congestion. \nWe lack sufficient time to issue a proposed rule and consider comments \nprior to needing to begin the temporary deviation to the operating \nschedule.\n    Also, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good \ncause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after \npublication in the Federal Register. Delaying the effective date of \nthis rule would be impracticable because action is needed to respond to \nchange in drawbridge schedule starting on May 22, 2025. The Coast Guard \nis soliciting comments on this temporary interim rule. If the Coast \nGuard determines that changes to the temporary interim rule are \nnecessary, we will publish a temporary final rule or other appropriate \ndocument. If the Coast Guard determines that no changes are necessary \nto the schedule provided in this rule, we may finalize the operating \nschedule as permanent upon completion of the approved deviation.\n\nIII. Legal Authority and Need for Rule\n\n    The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in 33 U.S.C. \n499.\n    Public concern that vehicles unloaded from the ferry, the S.S. \nBadger, brought to downtown Manitowoc from Ludington, Michigan were \ncausing vehicle traffic congestion at the Eighth Street Bridge, mile \n0.29 and the Tenth Street Bridge, mile 0.43, prompted the City of \nManitowoc, Wisconsin, to request special bridge hours when the S.S. \nBadger unloads vehicles. After a formal inquiry into the operations of \nthe S.S. Badger, it was determined that their slow loading and \noffloading process did not cause vehicle congestion to downtown \nManitowoc.\n    Thus, to improve the flow of vehicles across the city, WisDOT, in \ncooperation with the City of Manitowoc, completed studies to make \nroadway improvements. The studies indicated that a combined 20,600 \nvehicles cross over the Eighth Street Bridge, mile 0.29 and the Tenth \nStreet Bridge, mile 0.43, daily. Proposed solutions to traffic \ncongestion include instituting one-way traffic on each bridge to \nfacilitate efficient traffic flows. To further ease vehicle congestion, \nthe state of Wisconsin has designed a roundabout to the north and south \nof the bridges to alleviate vehicles sitting at traffic lights or stop \nsigns. This will help create a better flow of vehicles rather than \nseveral small surges of vehicles trying to cross the bridges.\n    In order to try to minimize traffic congestion in downtown \nManitowoc and to meet the reasonable needs of navigation, the Coast \nGuard will be authorizing a TIR for the Eighth Street Bridge, mile 0.29 \nand the Tenth Street Bridge, mile 0.43, to allow the public to test the \nproposed regulation and comment on its effectiveness.\n    After reviewing drawtender logs for each of the two bridges, we \ndiscovered each bridge opens over 500 times annually, and most openings \noccur between May and October of each year. Of the total openings, \napproximately 237 openings were done to accommodate recreational \nvessels, and 263 openings were done to accommodate commercial vessels. \nThis data provides a roughly equal balance of openings between the \nprimary vessel types (recreational and commercial).\n    Currently, the regulations provide that, from April 1 through \nOctober 31, the bridges provide two 10-minute periods (6:50 a.m. to 7 \na.m., and 7:50 a.m. to 8 a.m.) and two 15-minute periods (11:55 a.m. to \n12:10 p.m., and 12:45 p.m. to 1 p.m.) each day, during which the bridge \nneed not open, to alleviate vehicle congestion at the bridges. The \nregulations also include a 6-hour advance notice required for openings \nduring a 6-hour period between 10:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. The current \nregulation was drafted by the railroads and approved by the United \nStates Department of War one hundred and four years ago. The regulation \nwas groundbreaking when it was first conceived, but by modern \nstandards, operations of the bridge are cumbersome, as the existing \nregulation does not account for the increase in population. It is also \noutdated by the loss of the original railroads. Four short periods to \nallow vehicles to cross the bridges is an antiquated process that does \nnot meet the current need of land transportation. We reviewed the \nhourly vehicular traffic logs from the city and discovered each bridge \nhandles over 10,500 cars daily with three hours that peak for vehicle \ncrossings. The three periods are in the morning while people are \ntraveling to work, mid-day when people are traveling for lunch, and \nevening when people tend to leave work for home. The vehicle counts \nprovided by the city show 1610 vehicles on\n\n[[Page 21696]]\n\naverage cross the bridges in the morning rush hour from 7 a.m. to 8 \na.m., 2370 vehicles cross the bridge a from 11 a.m. to noon, and 2855 \nvehicles cross the bridges from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. These three rush-hours \ncombined for both bridges would facilitate 6835 vehicles throughout \ndowntown.\n\nIV. Discussion of the Rule\n\n    Under the new regulation, the times the bridges remain closed to \nalleviate motor vehicle traffic congestion will be scheduled for three \nseparate hour-long periods during the morning (7 a.m. to 8 a.m.), \nmidday (11 a.m. to noon), and evening (4 p.m. to 5 p.m.) rush-hours \nwhen traffic is the busiest. If the bridges remain open during these \ntimes, based on the rush hour traffic patterns, the roads will become \nmore congested, making it difficult for vehicles to travel efficiently. \nAs more drivers learn of these mandated periods where the bridge is not \nrequired to open, we speculate more drivers will adjust their schedules \nto cross the bridges during these times.\n    Furthermore, the old regulation requires special sound signals to \nrequest openings for each bridge. This is an antiquated system long \novertaken by the utility and popularity of VHF-FM Marine Radios and \ncellular telephones (utilized in most vessel calls to the bridges when \nrequesting openings). By removing these specialized series of horn \nblasts in the new regulation, we will simplify the process and make the \nrule easier to understand and remember.\n    Weekend and holiday tourism patterns diverge heavily from weekday \npatterns. As a result, on weekends and holidays, the bridges will open \non signal during the day, but not during the evenings. This change will \navoid impeding trade or travel levels typically associated with these \ntraditional non-working days.\n    The current regulation allows for a deviation for six hours in the \nevening from the general requirement in 33 CFR 117.7(a) to man the \ndrawbridge with drawtenders (10:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m.) and requires \nmariners to provide six hours advance notice when requesting bridge \nopenings. The current regulation is generally unaccommodating to \nmariners and creates a potential safety risk to mariners seeking safe \nharbor from storms. It requires a 6-hour notice for an opening, but the \nclosure itself is 6-hours in duration. As a result, ships traveling to \nManitowoc or leaving port who are running a little late from loading or \nunloading cargo may need to wait until morning for the bridge to open. \nTo better accommodate vessels which may require an opening, we are \nadjusting the evening and morning hours by 30 minutes (10 p.m. to 4 \na.m.) and are also reducing the advance notice to 2 hours, instead of 6 \nhours, based on times when vessels seldom request openings.\n    The current regulation lists winter hours starting on November 1 \nand ending on March 31. Drawtender logs show the bridges open an \naverage of 75 times during the month of November. Moving the winter \nhours to begin on December 1 would relieve the mariners from the burden \nof the advance notice requirements in November and would allow the city \nto have a drawtender on duty during the busy November months, without \nrecalling personnel to operate the bridges. Therefore, the new \nregulation includes a provision changing the beginning of the winter \nhours to December 1.\n    We are considering making this temporary interim rule's regulation \nfor the drawbridge operation permanent and request public comment on \nthat path.\n    On April 30, 2024, we emailed a draft copy of the proposed \ntemporary rule to the City of Manitowoc, Lake Carriers Association, \nRand Logistics Incorporated, and Chamber of Marine Commerce for initial \ncomments prior to publishing the test deviation on <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>. \nWe did not receive any negative comments, but we did receive one \nsupporting comment by phone from a commercial mariner.\n    We view public participation as essential to effective rulemaking \nand will consider all comments and material received during the comment \nperiod. Your comment can help shape the outcome of this rulemaking. If \nyou submit a comment, please include the docket number for this \nrulemaking, indicate the specific section of this document to which \neach comment applies, and provide a reason for each suggestion or \nrecommendation. Your comments will help us determine if this operating \nschedule should become the new permanent operating schedule.\n    We encourage you to submit comments through the Federal Decision-\nMaking Portal at <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>. To do so, go to <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>, type USCG-2024-0407 in the search box and click \n``Search.''

If your material \ncannot be submitted using <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>, contact the \nperson in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this document \nfor alternate instructions.\n\nV. Regulatory Analyses\n\n    We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and \nExecutive Orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses \nbased on a number of these statutes and Executive Orders.\n\nA. Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the \ncosts and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits. This rule has not been designated a ``significant \nregulatory action,'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. \nAccordingly, it has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB).\n    This regulatory action determination is based on the ability that \nvessels can still transit the bridge given advanced notice.\n\nB. Impact on Small Entities\n\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as \namended, requires federal agencies to consider the potential impact of \nregulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term ``small \nentities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations \nthat are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their \nfields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than \n50,000.\n    While some owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the \nbridge may be small entities, for the reasons stated in section V.A \nabove, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on any \nvessel owner or operator.\n    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small \nentities in understanding this rule. If the rule would affect your \nsmall business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have \nquestions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please \ncontact the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT \nsection.\n    Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal \nemployees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal \nregulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory \nEnforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory \nFairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and \nrates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to \ncomment on actions by\n\n[[Page 21697]]\n\nemployees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The \nCoast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or \ncomplain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.\n\nC. Collection of Information\n\n    This rule calls for no new collection of information under the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nD. Federalism and Indian Tribal Government\n\n    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, \nFederalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on the \nrelationship between the national government and the States, or on the \ndistribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of \ngovernment. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have \ndetermined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism \nprinciples and preemption requirements described in Executive Order \n13132.\n    Also, this rule does not have tribal implications under Executive \nOrder 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal \nGovernments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on \none or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and \nresponsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.\n\nE. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) \nrequires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary \nregulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may \nresult in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in \nthe aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for \ninflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in \nsuch an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere \nin this preamble.\n\nF. Environment\n\n    We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security \nManagement Directive 023-01, Rev. 1, associated implementing \ninstructions, and Environmental Planning Policy COMDTINST 5090.1 \n(series) which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f). The \nCoast Guard has determined that this action is one of a category of \nactions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant \neffect on the human environment. This rule promulgates the operating \nregulations or procedures for drawbridges and is categorically excluded \nfrom further review, under paragraph L49, of Department of Homeland \nSecurity Management Directive 023-01, Rev. 1, Table 1 and Chapter 3, \nTable 3-1 of the U.S. Coast Guard Environmental Planning Implementation \nProcedures.\n    Neither a Record of Environmental Consideration nor a Memorandum \nfor the Record are required for this rule.\n\nList of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117\n\n    Bridges.\n    For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the Coast Guard amends \n33 CFR part 117 as follows:\n\nPART 117--DRAWBRIDGE OPERATION REGULATIONS\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 117 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 33 U.S.C. 499; 33 CFR 1.05-1; Department of Homeland \nSecurity Delegation No. 0170.1. Revision No. 01.3\n\n0\n2.

The southern New England area trophy fishery is \ndefined as south of 42[deg] N lat. and north of 39[deg]18' N lat. This \naction applies to Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Angling and HMS \nCharter/Headboat permitted vessels when fishing recreationally.\n\nDATES: Effective 11:30 p.m., local time, May 16, 2025, through December \n31, 2025.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Aiman Raza, <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cfaea6a2aea1e1bdaeb5ae8fa1a0aeaee1a8a0b9\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"187971757976366a7962795876777979367f776e\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, or \nLarry Redd, Jr., <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7e121f0c0c07500c1b1a1a3e10111f1f50191108\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"4a262b38383364382f2e2e0a24252b2b642d253c\">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, by email, or by phone at 301-427-\n8503.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Atlantic BFT fisheries are managed under the \n2006 Consolidated Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan (HMS \nFMP) and its amendments, pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act; 16 U.S.C. 1801 \net seq.) and consistent with the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA; \n16 U.S.C. 971 et seq.). ATCA is the implementing statute for binding \nrecommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of \nAtlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The HMS FMP and its amendments are implemented \nby regulations at 50 CFR part 635. Section 635.27(a) divides the U.S. \nBFT quota, established by ICCAT and as implemented by the United States \namong the various domestic fishing categories, per the allocations \nestablished in the HMS FMP and its amendments. NMFS is required under \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1854(g)(1)(D) to provide U.S. \nfishing vessels with a reasonable opportunity to harvest quotas under \nrelevant\n\n[[Page 21698]]\n\ninternational fishery agreements such as the ICCAT Convention, which is \nimplemented domestically pursuant to ATCA.\n    Under Sec.  635.28(a)(1), NMFS files a closure notice with the \nOffice of the Federal Register for publication when a BFT quota (or \nsubquota) is reached or is projected to be reached. Retaining, \npossessing, or landing BFT under that quota category is prohibited on \nand after the effective date and time of a closure notice for that \ncategory, for the remainder of the fishing year, until the opening of \nthe subsequent quota period or until such date as specified.\n    Every year, the BFT fishing year starts on January 1 and ends on \nDecember 31. The Angling category opens on January 1 and continues \nthrough December 31 or until the applicable quota or subquota is \nreached or projected to be reached, whichever comes first. As described \nin Sec.  635.27(a), the current baseline U.S. BFT quota is 1,316.14 \nmetric tons (mt) (not including the 25 mt ICCAT allocated to the United \nStates to account for bycatch of BFT in pelagic longline fisheries in \nthe Northeast Distant Gear Restricted Area per Sec.  635.27(a)(3)). The \nAngling category baseline quota is 297.4 mt, of which 9.2 mt (3.1 \npercent of the annual Angling category quota) is sub-allocated for the \nharvest of large medium and giant (trophy) BFT by vessels fishing under \nthe Angling category quota, with 2.3 mt (25 percent of the annual large \nmedium and giant BFT Angling category quota) allocated for each of the \nfour areas delineated at Sec.  635.27(a)(2)(iii), including the area \nthat is south of 42[deg] N lat. and north of 39[deg]18' N lat. (the \nsouthern New England area). Trophy BFT measure 73 inches (185 cm) \ncurved fork length or greater. This closure action applies to the \nsouthern New England area.\n\nAngling Category Trophy Bluefin Tuna Southern New England Area Fishery \nClosure\n\n    Based on landings data from the NMFS Automated Catch Reporting \nSystem, as well as average catch rates and anticipated fishing \nconditions, NMFS has determined the Angling category southern New \nEngland area trophy BFT subquota of 2.3 mt is projected to be reached \nand exceeded shortly. Therefore, retaining, possessing, or landing \nlarge medium or giant (i.e., measuring 73 inches (185 cm) curved fork \nlength or greater) BFT south of 42[deg] N lat. and north of 39[deg]18' \nN lat by persons aboard HMS Angling and HMS Charter/Headboat permitted \nvessels (when fishing recreationally) must cease at 11:30 p.m. local \ntime on May 16, 2025. This closure will remain effective through \nDecember 31, 2025. This action applies to HMS Angling and HMS Charter/\nHeadboat permitted vessels when fishing recreationally for BFT, and is \ntaken consistent with the regulations at Sec.  635.28(a)(1). This \naction is intended to prevent overharvest of the Angling category \nsouthern New England area trophy BFT subquota.\n    If needed to ensure available quotas or subquotas are not exceeded \nor to enhance fishing opportunities, subsequent Angling category \nadjustments or closures will be published in the Federal Register per \nSec. Sec.  635.27(a)(7) and 635.28(a)(1). Information regarding the \nAngling category fishery for Atlantic tunas, including daily retention \nlimits for BFT measuring 27 inches (68.5 cm) to less than 73 inches \n(185 cm), and any further Angling category adjustments, is available at \n<a href=\"https://hmspermits.noaa.gov\">https://hmspermits.noaa.gov</a>. During a closure, fishermen aboard HMS \nAngling and HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels when fishing \nrecreationally may continue to catch and release (or tag and release) \nBFT of all sizes, subject to the requirements of the catch-and-release \nand tag-and-release programs at Sec.  635.26. All BFT that are released \nmust be handled in a manner that will maximize survival, and without \nremoving the fish from the water, consistent with requirements at Sec.  \n635.21(a)(1). For additional information on safe handling, see the \n``Careful Catch and Release'' brochure available at <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/outreach-and-education/careful-catch-and-release-brochure/\">https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/outreach-and-education/careful-catch-and-release-brochure/</a>.\n\nMonitoring and Reporting\n\n    NMFS will continue to monitor the BFT fisheries closely. Per Sec.  \n635.5(c)(1), HMS Angling and HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessel \nowners are required to report the catch of all BFT retained or \ndiscarded dead, within 24 hours of the landing(s) or end of each trip, \nby accessing <a href=\"https://hmspermits.noaa.gov\">https://hmspermits.noaa.gov</a>, using the HMS Catch Reporting \napp, or calling (888) 872-8862 (Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. until \n4:30 p.m.).\n\nClassification\n\n    NMFS issues this action pursuant to section 305(d) of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1855(d)) and regulations at 50 CFR part 635, and \nthis action is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.\n    The Assistant Administrator for NMFS (AA) finds that pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. 553(b)(B), there is good cause to waive prior notice of, and an \nopportunity for public comment on, this action because it is \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest for the following \nreasons. Specifically, the regulations implementing the HMS FMP and its \namendments provide for inseason retention limit adjustments and fishery \nclosures to respond to the unpredictable nature of BFT availability on \nthe fishing grounds, the migratory nature of this species, and the \nregional variations in the BFT fishery. Providing for prior notice and \nopportunity to comment is impracticable and contrary to the public \ninterest as this fishery is currently underway and, based on the most \nrecent landings information, the Angling category southern New England \narea trophy BFT fishery subquota is projected to be reached and \nexceeded shortly. Delaying this action could result in excessive trophy \nBFT landings that may result in future potential quota reductions for \nthe Angling category, depending on the magnitude of a potential Angling \ncategory overharvest. NMFS must close the southern New England area \ntrophy BFT fishery before additional landings of these sizes of BFT \noccur. Taking this action does not raise conservation and management \nconcerns, and would support effective management of the BFT fishery. \nNMFS notes that the public had an opportunity to comment on the \nunderlying rulemakings that established the U.S. BFT quota and the \ninseason adjustment criteria.\n    For all of the above reasons, the AA also finds that pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. 553(d), there is good cause to waive the 30-day delay in \neffectiveness.\n\n    Authority: 16 U.S.C. 971 et seq. and 1801 et seq.\n\n    Dated: May 15, 2025.\nKelly Denit,\nDirector, Office of Sustainable Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries \nService.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09075 Filed 5-16-25; 4:15 pm]\nBILLING CODE 3510-22-P\n\n\n</pre><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script></body>\n</html>"

Direct Final Rulemaking Procedure\n\n    This is a direct final rulemaking. A significant adverse comment is \none that opposes the rule and raises, alone or in combination with \nother comments, a sufficiently serious issue under each of the \nindependent grounds provided to support the rule that additional \nconsideration and a substantive response are required. If significant \nadverse comments are received, notice will be published in the Federal \nRegister before the effective date either withdrawing the rule or \nissuing a new final rule that responds to significant adverse comments \nand carries a new effective date.\n\nII. Background\n\n    Section 1042(b) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 \n(CFPA) requires States to notify the Bureau and ``the prudential \nregulators,'' see 12 U.S.C. 5481(24), before ``initiating any action in \na court or other administrative or regulatory proceeding against any \ncovered person as authorized by subsection (a) [of section 1042] to \nenforce any provision'' of the CFPA. See 12 U.S.C. 5552(b)(1)(A). By \nstatute, such notice is required to be ``timely'' in the ordinary \ncourse or ``immediately upon instituting the action or proceeding'' in \nthe case of an emergency. 12 U.S.C. 5552(b)(1)(B). And the CFPA \nrequires that the notice contain ``a copy of the complete complaint to \nbe filed'' and a written description of ``such action or proceeding,'' \n12 U.S.C. 5552(b)(1)(A), as well as a description of the identity of \nthe parties, the alleged facts underlying the proceeding, and ``whether \nthere may be a need to coordinate the prosecution of the proceeding so \nas not to interfere with any action, including any rulemaking, \nundertaken by the Bureau, a prudential regulator, or another Federal \nagency.'' 12 U.S.C. 5552(b)(1)(C). On June 29, 2012, the Bureau issued \nregulations, codified at 12 CFR 1082.1, regarding States' obligations \nto notify the Bureau and prudential regulators of actions covered by \nsection 1042.\n\nIII. Analysis\n\n    Pursuant to the Bureau's policy of eliminating unnecessary \nregulatory burdens and rescinding rules that are not necessary to \neffectuate Congress's statutes, the Bureau is rescinding the \nregulations related to state notification codified at 12 CFR 1082.1. \nThe regulations at 12 CFR 1082.1, with only minor tweaks that are not \nnecessary to provide the Bureau or the prudential regulators adequate \nnotice of State actions, merely restate the notification requirements \ncodified in section 1042(b). As such, the notification regulations are \nunnecessary and should be eliminated from the Code of Federal \nRegulations. Where Congress's statutes are sufficiently clear and \nprescriptive, regulations do little more than increase costs and cause \nconfusion, and so are unnecessary.\n\nIV. Legal Authority\n\n    Section 1042(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5552(c).\n\nV. Section 1022 Analysis\n\n    In developing this rule, the Bureau has considered the potential \nbenefits, costs, and impacts as required by section 1022(b)(2)(A) of \nthe CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5512(b)(2)(A). This rule will reduce regulatory \nburdens on State Officials and does not impose any obligations on \nconsumers or have any direct impact on their access to consumer \nfinancial products or services. Further, it has no unique impact on \ninsured depository institutions or insured credit unions with less than \n$10 billion in assets, as described in section 1026(a) of the CFPA. \nFinally, it does not have any unique impact on rural consumers.\n\nVI. Procedural Matters\n\nA. Regulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act generally requires an agency to \nconduct an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) and a final \nregulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking requirements unless the agency certifies that the \nrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial \nnumber of small entities (SISNOSE). The Bureau is also subject to \nspecific additional procedures under the RFA involving convening a \npanel to consult with small business representatives before proposing a \nrule for which an IRFA is required.\n    This rule's only effect is to clarify State Officials' statutory \nobligations, see 12 U.S.C. 552(b). It has no effect on small entities \nof any kind.\n\n[[Page 21692]]\n\n    Accordingly, the Director hereby certifies that this rule does not \nhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \nentities.

FMCSA \nmust publish a notice of each exemption request in the Federal Register \n(49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an opportunity \nto inspect the information relevant to the application, including the \napplicant's safety analysis. The Agency must provide an opportunity for \npublic comment on the request.\n    The Agency reviews the application, safety analyses, and public \ncomments submitted and determines whether granting the exemption would \nlikely maintain a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the \nlevel that would be achieved absent such exemption, pursuant to the \nstandard set forth in 49 U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must publish \nits decision in the Federal Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, \nthe notice will identify the regulatory provision from which the \napplicant will be exempt, the effective period, and all terms and \nconditions of the exemption (49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption is \ndenied, the notice will explain the reason for the denial (49 CFR \n381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)).\n\nIII. Applicant's Request\n\n    William Cole, Safety Coordinator for the Montana Trucking \nAssociation, seeks an exemption from the requirement in the ELDT \nregulations in 49 CFR 380.605 that HM theory instructors have at least \ntwo years of driving experience of the same or higher class and/or the \nsame endorsement level for which training is to be provided.\n    The applicant states that the exemption would enable him to provide \nHM training while maintaining the highest level of safety and \ncompliance standards.\n    Mr. Cole has served for 15 years as a CMV enforcement officer with \nthe state's Motor Carrier Services agency and is currently the Safety \nCoordinator for Montana Trucking Association, which provides HM \ntraining to motor carriers, conducts FMCSA compliance audits, and \nassists industry leaders in understanding and implementing HM safety \nprotocols. Mr. Cole believes his qualifications ``exceed the necessary \nknowledge and instructional standards for ELDT theory training.'' The \nfollowing is a list of Mr. Cole's credentials included in the exemption \napplication request:\n\n<bullet> CVSA Advanced Hazmat Instructor\n\n[[Page 21822]]\n\n<bullet> Certified Safety & Health Official (CSHO)--Construction\n<bullet> Specialist in Safety & Health (SSH)--General Industry\n<bullet> OSHA Outreach Trainer--Construction\n<bullet> Member of the ATA Law Enforcement Advisory Board\n<bullet> Facilitator of the Montana Trucking Association Safety Council\n\n    A copy of Mr. Cole's exemption application is available for review \nin the docket for this notice.\n\nIV. Request for Comments\n\n    In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31315(b), FMCSA requests public \ncomment from all interested persons on Mr. Cole's application for an \nexemption from the requirements in 49 CFR 380.605 from the definition \nof ``theory instructor,'' which would allow him to become an ELDT \ntheory instructor for HM endorsements.

These \nactions are due to the decommissioning of the Nondirectional Radio \nBeacon (NDB) portion of the Gambell NDB/distance measuring equipment \n(DME) in Alaska.\n\nDATES: Effective date 0901 UTC, August 7, 2025.

You may also contact the Rules and \nRegulations Group, Policy Directorate, Federal Aviation Administration, \n600 Independence Avenue SW, Washington DC 20597; telephone: (202) 267-\n8783.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven Roff, Rules and Regulations \nGroup, Office of Policy, Federal Aviation Administration, 600 \nIndependence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20597; telephone: (202) 267-\n8783.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is \nfound in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 \ndescribes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, \nAviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's \nauthority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described \nin Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, \nthe FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of \nthe airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the \nefficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority as it modifies the Air Traffic Service (ATS) route structure \nas necessary to preserve the safe and efficient flow of air traffic \nwithin the National Airspace System.\n\nHistory\n\n    The FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking for Docket No. \nFAA-2024-2348 in the Federal Register (89 FR 81406; October 8, 2024), \nproposing to revoke Alaskan VOR Federal Airway V-414 and amend RNAV \nRoutes T-248 and T-250 in Alaska. Interested parties were invited to \nparticipate in this rulemaking effort by submitting written comments on \nthe proposal. No comments were received.\n\nDifferences From the NPRM\n\n    The NPRM proposed to replace the Gambell NDB/DME with a new \nwaypoint (WP) FOXNO. After the publication of the NPRM, the FAA decided \nto retain the DME portion of the Gambell NDB/DME and continue with the \ndecommissioning of the NDB. With the retention of the DME portion of \nthe Gambell NDB/DME, the FOXNO WP will no longer be utilized by RNAV \nRoutes T-248 or T-250. This action updates the route descriptions for \nT-248 and T-250 in accordance with that change.\n\nIncorporation by Reference\n\n    Alaskan VOR Federal Airways are published in paragraph 6010(b) and \nUnited States RNAV Routes are published in paragraph 6011 of FAA Order \nJO 7400.11, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, which is \nincorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This \ndocument amends the current version of that order, FAA Order JO \n7400.11J, dated July 31, 2024, and effective September 15, 2024. These \namendments will be published in the next update to FAA Order JO \n7400.11. FAA Order JO 7400.11J is publicly available as listed in the \nADDRESSES section of this document.\n    FAA Order JO 7400.11J lists Class A, B, C, D, and E airspace areas, \nair traffic service routes, and reporting points.\n\nThe Rule\n\n    This action amends 14 CFR part 71 by revoking Alaskan Very High \nFrequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airway V-414 and amending \nRNAV Routes T-248 and T-250 in Alaska. These proposed actions are due \nto the decommissioning of the NDB portion of the Gambell NDB/DME in \nAlaska.\n    V-414: Prior to this final rule, V-414 extended between the \nGambell, AK, NDB/DME and the Kukuliak, AK, VOR/DME. This rule revokes \nV-414 in its entirety.\n    T-248: Prior to this final rule, T-248 extended between the \nGambell, AK, NDB/DME and the Emmonak, AK, VOR/DME. This rule amends T-\n248 by replacing the Gambell NDB/DME with the Gambell, AK, DME. As \namended, T-248 would extend between the Gambell DME and the Emmonak \nVOR/DME.\n    T-250: Prior to this final rule, T-250 extended between the \nKukuliak, AK, VOR/DME and the Bethel, AK, Very High Frequency \nOmnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC). This rule \nextends the route westward by adding the Gambell, AK, DME to the route \ndescription. As amended, T-250 would extend between the Gambell DME and \nthe Bethel VORTAC.\n\n[[Page 21693]]\n\nRegulatory Notices and Analyses\n\n    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an \nestablished body of technical regulations for which frequent and \nroutine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. \nIt, therefore: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under \nExecutive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT \nRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); \nand (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the \nanticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that \nonly affects air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified \nthat this rule, when promulgated, does not have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nEnvironmental Review\n\n    The FAA has determined that this action of revoking Alaskan VOR \nFederal Airway V-414 and amending RNAV Routes T-248 and T-250 in Alaska \nqualifies for categorical exclusion under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.), and in accordance with FAA Order \n1050.1F, Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures, paragraph 5-\n6.5a, which categorically excludes from further environmental impact \nreview rulemaking actions that designate or modify classes of airspace \nareas, airways, routes, and reporting points (see 14 CFR part 71, \nDesignation of Class A, B, C, D, and E Airspace Areas; Air Traffic \nService Routes; and Reporting Points); and paragraph 5-6.5k, which \ncategorically excludes from further environmental impact review the \npublication of existing air traffic control procedures that do not \nessentially change existing tracks, create new tracks, change altitude, \nor change concentration of aircraft on these tracks. As such, this \naction is not expected to result in any potentially significant \nenvironmental impacts. In accordance with FAA Order 1050.1F, paragraph \n5-2 regarding Extraordinary Circumstances, the FAA has reviewed this \naction for factors and circumstances in which a normally categorically \nexcluded action may have a significant environmental impact requiring \nfurther analysis.

The MCAI \nstates a production quality escape was discovered, where the interface \npin of the secondary load path in the upper gimbal of the HSTA was \nincorrectly installed. This condition, if not corrected, could \ncompromise the secondary load path in the upper gimbal of the HSTA and \ncause a mechanical disconnect of the horizontal stabilizer leading to a \nloss of control of the airplane.\n    The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on \nthese products.\n\n[[Page 21701]]\n\n    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under \nDocket No. FAA-2025-0911.\n\nMaterial Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51\n\n    Transport Canada AD CF-2025-07 specifies procedures for a detailed \nvisual inspection of the interface pin of the secondary load path in \nthe upper gimbal of the HSTA to determine if the interface pin is \nincorrectly installed, and applicable on-condition actions including \nmodification of an incorrectly installed interface pin. This material \nis reasonably available because the interested parties have access to \nit through their normal course of business or by the means identified \nin the ADDRESSES section.\n\nFAA's Determination\n\n    This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another \ncountry and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to \nthe FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, it \nhas notified the FAA of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI \nreferenced above. The FAA is issuing this NPRM after determining that \nthe unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop \nin other products of the same type design.\n\nProposed AD Requirements in This NPRM\n\n    This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified \nin Transport Canada AD CF-2025-07 described previously, except for any \ndifferences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this \nproposed AD.\n\nExplanation of Required Compliance Information\n\n    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD \nprocess, the FAA developed a process to use some civil aviation \nauthority (CAA) ADs as the primary source of information for compliance \nwith requirements for corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been \ncoordinating this process with manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, the \nFAA proposes to incorporate Transport Canada AD CF-2025-07 by reference \nin the FAA final rule. This proposed AD would, therefore, require \ncompliance with Transport Canada AD CF-2025-07 in its entirety through \nthat incorporation, except for any differences identified as exceptions \nin the regulatory text of this proposed AD. Material required by \nTransport Canada AD CF-2025-07 for compliance will be available at \n<a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under Docket No. FAA-2025-0911 after the FAA final rule \nis published.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\n    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would \naffect 90 airplanes of U.S. registry. The FAA estimates the following \ncosts to comply with this proposed AD:\n\n                                      Estimated Costs for Required Actions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                    Cost per       Cost on U.S.\n                          Labor cost                              Parts cost        product         operators\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 work-hour x $85 per hour = $85.............................              $0              $85           $7,650\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The FAA estimates the following costs to do any necessary on-\ncondition action that would be required based on the results of any \nrequired actions. The FAA has no way of determining the number of \naircraft that might need this on-condition action:\n\n                 Estimated Costs of On-Condition Actions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Labor cost                 Parts cost      Cost per product\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5 work-hours x $85 per hour = $425         $49,370              $49,795\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The FAA has included all known costs in its cost estimate. \nAccording to the manufacturer, however, some or all of the costs of \nthis proposed AD may be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the \ncost impact on affected operators.\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to \nissue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism \nimplications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not \nhave a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship \nbetween the national government and the States, or on the distribution \nof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed \nregulation:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866,\n    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or \nnegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Proposed Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\n[[Page 21702]]\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n\n\nSec.  39.13  [Amended]\n\n0\n2. The FAA amends Sec.  39.13 by adding the following new airworthiness \ndirective:\n\nAirbus Canada Limited Partnership (Type Certificate Previously Held \nby C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP); Bombardier, Inc.): \nDocket No. FAA-2025-0911; Project Identifier MCAI-2025-00119-T.\n\n(a) Comments Due Date\n\n    The FAA must receive comments on this airworthiness directive \n(AD) by July 7, 2025.\n\n(b) Affected ADs\n\n    None.\n\n(c) Applicability\n\n    This AD applies to Airbus Canada Limited Partnership (Type \nCertificate previously held by C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership \n(CSALP); Bombardier, Inc.) Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 \nairplanes, certificated in any category, as identified in Transport \nCanada AD CF-2025-07, dated January 27, 2025 (Transport Canada AD \nCF-2025-07).\n\n(d) Subject\n\n    Air Transport Association (ATA) of America Code 27, Flight \ncontrols.\n\n(e) Unsafe Condition\n\n    This AD was prompted by reports that the interface pin of the \nsecondary load path in the upper gimbal of the horizontal stabilizer \ntrim actuator (HSTA) was incorrectly installed. The FAA is issuing \nthis AD to ensure the interface pin of the HSTA is installed \ncorrectly. The unsafe condition, if not addressed, could result in a \nmechanical disconnect of the horizontal stabilizer leading to a loss \nof control of the airplane.\n\n(f) Compliance\n\n    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, \nunless already done.\n\n(g) Requirements\n\n    Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this AD: Comply with all \nrequired actions and compliance times specified in, and in \naccordance with, Transport Canada AD CF-2025-07.\n\n(h) Exception to Transport Canada AD CF-2025-07\n\n    (1) Where Transport Canada AD CF-2025-07 refers to its effective \ndate, this AD requires using the effective date of this AD.\n    (2) Where Transport Canada AD CF-2025-07 refers to hours air \ntime, this AD requires using flight hours.\n\n(i) Special Flight Permit\n\n    Special flight permits, as described in 14 CFR 21.197 and \n21.199, are not allowed.\n\n(j) Additional AD Provisions\n\n    The following provisions also apply to this AD:\n    (1) Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs): The Manager, AIR-\n520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA, has the authority to \napprove AMOCs for this AD, if requested using the procedures found \nin 14 CFR 39.19.

Any commentary that the FAA receives which \nis not specifically designated as CBI will be placed in the public \ndocket for this rulemaking.\n\nBackground\n\n    EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the \nEuropean Union, has issued EASA AD 2025-0093, dated April 24, 2025 \n(EASA AD 2025-0093) (also referred to as ``the MCAI''), to correct an \nunsafe condition for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and A350-1041 \nairplanes. The MCAI reports instances of mechanical noises originating \nfrom the NLG shock absorber during ground maneuvers. Further analysis \ntraced these noises to higher than expected friction between the lower \nbearing carrier (LBC) and the main fitting of the sliding tube. This \nfriction may cause deformation of the LBC's anti-rotation tabs, leading \nto relative movement between the LBC and the main fitting. As a result, \nwear on the corrosion protection coating of the main fitting may occur \ndue to subsequent movement of the retainer ring positioned between \nthese components, which could lead to corrosion of the NLG main \nfitting.\n    The FAA is issuing this AD to address higher than expected friction \non the NLG shock absorber LBC, which could result in deformation of the \nLBC's anti-rotation tabs and consequent corrosion of the NLG main \nfitting. The unsafe condition, if not addressed, could lead to \nstructural failure of the NLG, which may result in damage to the \nairplane and injury to occupants.\n    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under \nDocket No. FAA-2025-0912.\n\nMaterial Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51\n\n    EASA AD 2025-0093 specifies procedures for repetitive inspections \n(i.e., steering checks) for relative movement between the LBC and the \nmain fitting and applicable on-condition actions. The on-condition \nactions include activating the secondary seal, inspecting and applying \ntorque to the nose landing gear seal changeover valve, inspecting the \nring groove for corrosion, and repairing any corrosion. EASA AD 2025-\n0093 also requires reporting the results of each check where a \ndiscrepancy was identified to the manufacturer and limits the \ninstallation of affected parts, for airplanes with an affected part \ninstalled, unless the steering check has been completed. For airplanes \nthat do not have an affected part installed, EASA AD 2025-0093 \nprohibits installing an affected part. This material is reasonably \navailable because the interested parties have access to it through \ntheir normal course of business or by the means identified in the \nADDRESSES section.\n\nFAA's Determination\n\n    This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another \ncountry and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to \nthe FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, it \nhas notified the FAA of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and \nmaterial referenced above. The FAA is issuing this NPRM after \ndetermining that the unsafe condition described previously is likely to \nexist or develop in other products of the same type design.\n\nProposed AD Requirements in This NPRM\n\n    This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified \nin EASA AD 2025-0093 described previously, except for any differences \nidentified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this proposed AD.\n\nExplanation of Required Compliance Information\n\n    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD \nprocess, the FAA developed a process to use some civil aviation \nauthority (CAA) ADs as the primary source of information for compliance \nwith requirements for corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been \ncoordinating this process with manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, the \nFAA proposes to incorporate EASA AD 2025-0093 by reference in the FAA \nfinal rule. This proposed AD would require compliance with EASA AD \n2025-0093 in its entirety through that incorporation, except for any \ndifferences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this \nproposed AD. Material required by EASA AD 2025-0093 for compliance will \nbe available at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> under Docket No. FAA-2025-0912 after \nthe FAA final rule is published.\n\n[[Page 21704]]\n\nInterim Action\n\n    The FAA considers that this proposed AD would be an interim action. \nThe manufacturer is analyzing the inspection results to assist in their \nongoing investigation and help determine if further corrective actions \nare needed. If final action is later identified, the FAA might consider \nfurther rulemaking then.\n\nCosts of Compliance\n\n    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would \naffect 33 airplanes of U.S. registry. The FAA estimates the following \ncosts to comply with this proposed AD:\n\n                                      Estimated Costs for Required Actions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                Cost on U.S.\n        Action                  Labor cost            Parts cost       Cost per product          operators\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInspection............

Up to 11 work-hours x $85    Up to $2,000..........  Up to $2,935.\n                                      per hour = $935.\nReporting..........................  1 work-hour x $85 per hour   $0....................  $85.\n                                      = $85.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    A federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not \nrequired to respond to, nor shall a person be subject to a penalty for \nfailure to comply with a collection of information subject to the \nrequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act unless that collection of \ninformation displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. The OMB \nControl Number for this information collection is 2120-0056. Public \nreporting for this collection of information is estimated to take \napproximately 1 hour per response, including the time for reviewing \ninstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and \nmaintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the \ncollection of information. All responses to this collection of \ninformation are mandatory. Send comments regarding this burden estimate \nor any other aspect of this collection of information, including \nsuggestions for reducing this burden, to: Information Collection \nClearance Officer, Federal Aviation Administration, 10101 Hillwood \nParkway, Fort Worth, TX 76177-1524.\n\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\n\n    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to \nissue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the \nauthority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, \ndescribes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\n    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in \nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. \nUnder that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight \nof civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for \npractices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary \nfor safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that \nauthority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to \nexist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\n\nRegulatory Findings\n\n    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism \nimplications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not \nhave a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship \nbetween the national government and the States, or on the distribution \nof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\n    For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed \nregulation:\n    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive \nOrder 12866,\n    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or \nnegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\n\n    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by \nreference, Safety.\n\nThe Proposed Amendment\n\n    Accordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the \nAdministrator, the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\n\nPART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\n\n    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n\n\nSec.  39.13  [Amended]\n\n0\n2. The FAA amends Sec.  39.13 by adding the following new airworthiness \ndirective:\n\nAirbus SAS: Docket No. FAA-2025-0912; Project Identifier MCAI-2024-\n00571-T.\n\n(a) Comments Due Date\n\n    The FAA must receive comments on this airworthiness directive \n(AD) by July 7, 2025.\n\n(b) Affected ADs\n\n    None.\n\n(c) Applicability\n\n    This AD applies to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and A350-1041 \nairplanes, certificated in any category.\n\n(d) Subject\n\n    Air Transport Association (ATA) of America Code 32, Landing \nGear.\n\n(e) Unsafe Condition\n\n    This AD was prompted by reports of higher than expected friction \non the nose landing gear (NLG) shock absorber lower bearing carrier \n(LBC), which could result in deformation of the LBC's anti-rotation \ntabs and consequent corrosion of the NLG main fitting. The unsafe \ncondition, if not addressed, could lead to structural failure of\n\n[[Page 21705]]\n\nthe NLG, which could result in damage to the airplane and injury to \noccupants.\n\n(f) Compliance\n\n    Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, \nunless already done.\n\n(g) Requirements\n\n    Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this AD: Comply with all \nrequired actions and compliance times specified in, and in \naccordance with, EASA AD 2025-0093, dated April 24, 2025 (EASA AD \n2025-0093).\n\n(h) Exceptions to EASA AD 2025-0093\n\n    (1) Where EASA AD 2025-0093 refers to its effective date, this \nAD requires using the effective date of this AD.\n    (2) Where EASA AD 2025-0093 refers to October 4, 2024 (the \neffective date of EASA AD 2024-0188), this AD requires using the \neffective date of this AD.\n    (3) Where paragraph (2) of EASA AD 2025-0093 specifies ``within \nthe compliance time(s) specified therein'', this AD requires \nreplacing that text with ``before further flight''.\n    (4) This AD does not adopt the ``Remarks'' section of EASA AD \n2025-0093.\n\n(i) Additional AD Provisions\n\n    The following provisions also apply to this AD:\n    (1) Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs): The Manager, AIR-\n520, Continued Operational Safety Branch, FAA, has the authority to \napprove AMOCs for this AD, if requested using the procedures found \nin 14 CFR 39.19.

Table of Abbreviations\n\nCFR Code of Federal Regulations\nCOTP Captain of the Port\nDHS Department of Homeland Security\nFR Federal Register\nNPRM Notice of proposed rulemaking\nSec.  Section\nU.S.C. United States Code\n\nII. Background, Purpose, and Legal Basis\n\n    On November 12, 2024, Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) 2025 Airshow \ncoordinators notified the Coast Guard that it will be conducting an Air \nShow that includes an aerial performance ``show box'' extending beyond \nthe Kaneohe Bay Naval Defensive Sea Area from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on \nAugust 8th, 9th, and 10th, 2025. Within this ``show box,'' the U.S. \nNavy Blue Angels Squadron will conduct aerobatic performances, \nexhibiting their aircraft's maximum performance capabilities, over \nKaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii during a 3-day period. Hazards associated \nwithin this ``show box'' during the Squadron's high powered multiple \njet aircraft performances include accidental discharge of jet fuel and \nfalling debris. Kaneohe Bay normally experiences heavy waterway traffic \nduring the weekends. The COTP has determined that potential hazards \nassociated with the aerial performance would be a safety concern for \nanyone within the ``show box'' that extend beyond the Kaneohe Bay Naval \nDefensive Sea.\n    The purpose of this rulemaking is to ensure the safety of vessels \nand the navigable waters within the ``show box'' before, during, and \nafter the scheduled event. The Coast Guard is proposing this rulemaking \nunder authority in 46 U.S.C. 70034.\n\nIII. Discussion of Proposed Rule\n\n    The COTP is proposing to establish a safety zone from 11 a.m. to 7 \np.m. on August 8 through August 10, 2025. The safety zone would cover \nall navigable waters within the following points 21[deg]26.159' N, \n157[deg]47.312' W; then south to 21[deg]25.890' N, 157[deg]47.250' W; \nthen northeast to 21[deg]27.943' N, 157[deg]44.953' W; then west to \n21[deg]28.016' N, 157[deg]45.250' W; and returning southwest to the \nstarting point to complete a rectangle. This safety zone would extend \nfrom the surface of the water to the ocean floor. The duration of the \nsafety zone is intended to ensure the safety of vessels and these \nnavigable waters before, during, and after the scheduled aerobatic \nperformances. No vessel or person would be permitted to enter the \nsafety zone without obtaining permission from the COTP or a designated \nrepresentative. Vessels requiring emergency transit through the zone \nmay request permission by contacting the on scene Patrol Commander on \nVHF channel 16 (156.800 MHz) or the Sector Honolulu Captain of the Port \nat telephone number 808-842-2600. The regulatory text we are proposing \nappears at the end of this document.\n\nIV. Regulatory Analyses\n\n    We developed this proposed rule after considering numerous statutes \nand Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our \nanalyses based on a number of these statutes and Executive orders.\n\nA. Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the \ncosts and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits. This NPRM has not been designated a ``significant \nregulatory action,'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. \nAccordingly, the NPRM has not been reviewed by the Office of Management \nand Budget (OMB).\n    This regulatory action determination is based the size, location, \nand duration of the safety zone. Vessels will be able to safely transit \naround this safety zone which would impact a small designated area of \nKaneohe Bay. Moreover, the Coast Guard would issue a Broadcast Notice \nto Mariners via VHF-FM marine channel 16 about the safety zone and the \nrule would allow vessels to seek permission to enter the zone.\n\nB. Impact on Small Entities\n\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as \namended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of \nregulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term ``small \nentities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations \nthat are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their \nfields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than \n50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this \nproposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities.\n    Vessels will be allowed to transit in and around the temporary \nsafety zones in Kaneohe Bay once permission to enter is granted. While \nsome owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the safety \nzone may be small entities, for the reasons stated in section IV.A \nabove, this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact \non any vessel owner or operator.\n    If you think that your business, organization, or governmental\n\n[[Page 21709]]\n\njurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this proposed rule \nwould have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment \n(see ADDRESSES) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to \nwhat degree this rule would economically affect it.\n    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small \nentities in understanding this proposed rule. If the proposed rule \nwould affect your small business, organization, or governmental \njurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or \noptions for compliance, please call or email the person listed in the \nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section. The Coast Guard will not \nretaliate against small entities that question or complain about this \nproposed rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.\n\nC. Collection of Information\n\n    This proposed rule would not call for a new collection of \ninformation under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-\n3520).\n\nD. Federalism and Indian Tribal Governments\n\n    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132 \n(Federalism), if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on \nthe relationship between the National Government and the States, or on \nthe distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels \nof government. We have analyzed this proposed rule under that Order and \nhave determined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism \nprinciples and preemption requirements described in Executive Order \n13132.\n    Also, this proposed rule does not have tribal implications under \nExecutive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal \nGovernments) because it would not have a substantial direct effect on \none or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and \nresponsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. If \nyou believe this proposed rule has implications for federalism or \nIndian tribes, please call or email the person listed in the FOR \nFURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section.\n\nE. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) \nrequires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary \nregulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may \nresult in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in \nthe aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for \ninflation) or more in any one year. Though this proposed rule would not \nresult in such an expenditure, we do discuss the potential effects of \nthis proposed rule elsewhere in this preamble.\n\nF. Environment\n\n    We have analyzed this proposed rule under Department of Homeland \nSecurity Directive 023-01, Rev. 1, associated implementing \ninstructions, and Environmental Planning COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), \nwhich guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have made \na preliminary determination that this action is one of a category of \nactions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant \neffect on the human environment. This proposed rule involves a safety \nzone that extends the Kaneohe Bay Naval Defensive Sea Area on both ends \nthat would prevent vessels from entering the flight paths for the \naerobatic performances. Normally such actions are categorically \nexcluded from further review under paragraph L60(a) of Appendix A, \nTable 1 of DHS Instruction Manual 023-01-001-01, Rev. 1. A preliminary \nRecord of Environmental Consideration supporting this determination is \navailable in the docket. For instructions on locating the docket, see \nthe ADDRESSES section of this preamble. We seek any comments or \ninformation that may lead to the discovery of a significant \nenvironmental impact from this proposed rule.\n\nV. Public Participation and Request for Comments\n\n    We view public participation as essential to effective rulemaking \nand will consider all comments and material received during the comment \nperiod. Your comment can help shape the outcome of this rulemaking. If \nyou submit a comment, please include the docket number for this \nrulemaking, indicate the specific section of this document to which \neach comment applies, and provide a reason for each suggestion or \nrecommendation.\n    Submitting comments.

Background\n\n    On November 2, 2015, the President signed into law the Federal \nCivil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (sec. \n701 of Pub. L. 114-74, 28 U.S.C. 2461 note) (``the 2015 Act''). The \n2015 Act required agencies to: (1) adjust the level of civil monetary \npenalties with an initial ``catch-up'' adjustment through an interim \nfinal rule, and (2) make subsequent annual adjustments for inflation \nnot later than January 15 of each year. The purpose of these \nadjustments is to maintain the deterrent effect of civil penalties. \nSince the passage of the 2015 Act, OPM has updated the agency's \nmonetary penalties found in 5 CFR part 185 that implement the Program \nFraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986.\n    This rule takes into account adjustments for the year 2025 based on \ninflation since the last adjustment. These calculations were made based \non guidance contained in Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-\n25-02:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                               2024 Inflation    2025 Inflation\n                CFR citation                    Description of the penalty       adjustment        adjustment\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5 CFR 185.103(a)............................  Civil Penalty for False Claims           $13,946           $14,308\n5 CFR 185.103(f)(2).........................  Civil Penalty for False                   13,946            14,308\n                                               Statements.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    This final rule is being issued without prior public notice or \nopportunity for public comments and is effective upon publication in \nthe Federal Register. The 2015 Act required the agency to adjust \npenalties initially through an interim final rulemaking, which did not \nrequire the agency to complete a notice and comment process prior to \npromulgating the interim final rule. The amendments also explicitly \nrequired the agency to make subsequent annual adjustments \nnotwithstanding 5 U.S.C. 553 (the section of the Administrative \nProcedure Act that normally requires agencies to engage in notice and \ncomment and to delay the effective date). The formula used for \nadjusting the amount of a civil penalty is given by statute, with no \ndiscretion provided to OPM regarding the computation of the \nadjustments. OPM is charged only with performing ministerial \ncomputations to determine the amount of adjustment to the civil \npenalties due to increases in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban \nConsumers (CPI-U).\n\nII. Calculation of Adjustment\n\n    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issues guidance annually \non calculating adjustments. Under this guidance, OPM has calculated the \nannual adjustment to the penalties in 5 CFR part 185 that implement the \nProgram Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986. A civil monetary penalty is \nany assessment with a dollar amount that is levied for a violation of a \nFederal civil statute or regulation and is assessed or enforceable \nthrough a civil action in Federal court or an administrative \nproceeding. A civil monetary penalty does not include a penalty levied \nfor violation of a criminal statute or fees for services, licenses, \npermits, or other regulatory review.\n    The Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-25-02 stated that \nthe cost-of-living multiplier for calculating adjustments in 2025 was \n1.02598. This multiplier is to be applied to the current level of civil \nmonetary penalties for agencies (i.e., the penalty amount the agency \nupdated and published for 2024). Under 5 CFR 185.103, when OPM's 2024 \npenalties of $13,946 are multiplied by 1.02598 and rounded to the \nnearest dollar, the resulting penalty amounts are each $14,308.\n\nIII. Procedural Requirements\n\nRegulatory Review\n\n    OPM has examined the impact of this rule as required by Executive \nOrders 12866, 13563, and 14094, which direct agencies to assess all \ncosts and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public \nhealth and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). OMB has \ndetermined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' \nunder section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive \nOrder 14094. This rule is not an E.O. 14192 regulatory action because \nthis rule is not significant under E.O. 12866.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) as amended by the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2)) requires \nan agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for rules unless \nthe agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The RFA\n\n[[Page 21688]]\n\napplies only to rules for which an agency is required to first publish \na proposed rule. See 5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a). The Federal Civil \nPenalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 requires \nagencies to adjust civil penalties annually. No discretion is allowed. \nThus, the Director of OPM certifies that the RFA does not apply to this \nfinal rule.\n\nUnfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995\n\n    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) \nrequires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before \nissuing any rule that would impose spending costs on State, local, or \nTribal governments in the aggregate, or on the private sector, in any 1 \nyear of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. \nThat threshold is currently approximately $183 million. This regulation \nwill not result in the expenditure by State, local, or Tribal \ngovernments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, in excess of \nthe threshold. Thus, no written assessment of unfunded mandates is \nrequired.\n\nE.O. 13132, Federalism\n\n    This rule does not have federalism implications. The rule does not \nhave substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship \nbetween the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution \nof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\n\nE.O. 12988, Civil Justice Reform\n\n    This rule complies with the requirements of E.O. 12988. \nSpecifically, this rule:\n    (a) Does not unduly burden the judicial system.\n    (b) Meets the criteria of section 3(a) requiring that all \nregulations be reviewed to eliminate errors and ambiguity and be \nwritten to minimize litigation; and\n    (c) Meets the criteria of section 3(b)(2) requiring that all \nregulations be written in clear language and contain clear legal \nstandards.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    This document does not contain information collection requirements \nsubject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, as amended (44 U.S.C. \n3501-3521).\n\nList of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 185\n\n    Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Fraud, Penalties.\n\nOffice of Personnel Management.\nJerson Matias,\nFederal Register Liaison.\n\n    Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, OPM amends \n5 CFR part 185 as follows:\n\nPART 185--PROGRAM FRAUD CIVIL REMEDIES\n\n0\n1. The authority citation for part 185 continues to read:\n\n    Authority: 28 U.S.C. 2461 note; 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812.\n\n\nSec.  185.103  [Amended]\n\n0\n2.

Executive Summary\n\n    PHMSA is publishing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking \n(ANPRM) to solicit stakeholder feedback on potential opportunities to \nimprove the cost-effectiveness of its repair requirements for gas \ntransmission (49 CFR part 192) and hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide \n(49 CFR part 195) pipelines. Many of those requirements--particularly \nfor hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines--have not been \nupdated in over two decades, and others do not fully account for recent \nadvancements in pipeline safety technology and best practices or the \nmaturation of PHMSA's regulatory regime. PHMSA is also seeking \nstakeholder feedback on authorizing risk-based inspection procedures \nfor determining the inspection interval for in-service breakout tanks \nunder part 195. Materials obtained from this ANPRM will inform a \nforthcoming notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in this proceeding.\n\nII. Background\n\n    PHMSA's safety standards for gas transmission lines (49 CFR part \n192) and hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines (49 CFR part \n195) address the remediation of anomalies in two ways: (1) through a \nset of traditional, prescriptive remediation requirements in the \noperation and maintenance provisions that generally apply to all \npipelines; and (2) through risk-based, integrity management (IM) \nrequirements that apply to pipeline segments posing risks to ``high \nconsequence areas.'' \\1\\ This two-tiered regulatory approach--coupled \nwith PHMSA's efforts to enhance its requirements for the design, \nconstruction, testing, operation, and maintenance of gas transmission \nand hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipelines--has contributed to a \npositive safety trend since 2005: fewer incidents and accidents \nentailing significantly lower public safety consequences and property \ndamage.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ See Sec. Sec.  192.903 (definition of high consequence \nareas, or HCAs, for gas transmission lines) and 195.450 (definition \nof HCAs for hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines)\n    \\2\\ See PHMSA, ``Pipeline Incident 20 Year Trends,'' <a href=\"https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-20-year-trends\">https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-20-year-trends</a> (last visited Mar. 26, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Despite this strong safety record, PHMSA recognizes that some of \nits repair requirements have not been updated for decades, and that \nothers may not account for the latest advances in pipeline safety \ntechnology and industry best practices. PHMSA also recognizes that its \nrepair requirements may need to be updated to align with the \nsignificant changes made to part 192 and part 195 in recent rulemaking \nproceedings.\\3\\ Existing repair requirements, therefore, may introduce \nbarriers to development and deployment of innovative, safety-enhancing \ntechnology and industry practices by increasing costs and potential \nliability risks for first-movers. Similarly, the accretion of complex \nand potentially overlapping regulatory requirements over time could \nsimilarly stifle innovation and entail compliance costs without a \ncorresponding safety benefit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\3\\ Listing in this ANPRM the large number of those rulemakings \nwould be difficult; however, PHMSA maintains a comprehensive list of \nits rulemakings on its website. See PHMSA, ``Notices and Rulemaking \nDocuments,'' <a href=\"https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/regulations/federal-register-documents\">https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/regulations/federal-register-documents</a> (last visited Mar. 27, 2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    For example:\n    <bullet> The repair criteria and remediation timelines in part 195 \nfor hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines have been relatively \nstatic for decades. PHMSA's generally applicable repair requirements at \nSec.  195.401 have not been changed substantially since 1981,\\4\\ and \nthe IM requirements for hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines \nat Sec.  195.452 have not been updated substantially since their \nintroduction in 2000.\\5\\ In the years since the adoption of each of \nthose regulatory frameworks, PHMSA has completed over a dozen \nrulemakings imposing a variety of design, testing, operational, \nmaintenance, and emergency response requirements intended to reduce the \nfrequency and severity of accidents on hazardous liquid and carbon \ndioxide pipelines.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\4\\ Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), \n``Transportation of Liquids by Pipeline,'' 46 FR 38357 (July 27, \n1981).\n    \\5\\ RSPA, ``Pipeline Safety: Pipeline Integrity Management in \nHigh Consequence Areas (Hazardous Liquid Operators with 500 or More \nMiles of Pipe),'' 65 FR 75406 (Dec 1, 2000).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> PHMSA most recently addressed part 192 anomaly remediation \nrequirements for gas transmission lines in its August 24, 2022 final \nrule (a rulemaking initiated following the 2010 incident near San \nBruno, CA).\\6\\ That final rule updated repair criteria and remediation \ntimelines for certain high-risk anomalies in HCAs in IM requirements in \nsubpart O and adopted similar repair criteria (but longer remediation \ntimelines) for anomalies discovered outside of HCAs in its\n\n[[Page 21717]]\n\ntraditional, prescriptive requirements in subpart M.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ PHMSA, ``Pipeline Safety: Safety of Gas Transmission \nPipelines: Repair Criteria, Integrity Management Improvements, \nCathodic Protection, Management of Change, and Other Related \nAmendments,'' 87 FR 52224 (Aug 24, 2022).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    <bullet> However, some of these amendments have been remanded to \nPHMSA for further consideration as a result of subsequent \nlitigation.\\7\\ PHMSA has, in the ten years since the San Bruno \nincident, also adopted a variety of new requirements in other recent \nrulemaking proceedings to reduce the frequency and severity of \nincidents on gas transmission lines.\\8\\ PHMSA has not conducted a \nwholistic review of its repair criteria for gas transmission lines \nsince making these changes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\7\\ See INGAA v. PHMSA, 114 F.4th 744, 756 (D.C. Cir. 2024).\n    \\8\\ Those recent rulemakings adopted new requirements on the \nfollowing topics: design features and operational practices to \nimprove rupture response practices; detailed procedures for \nconfirmation of maximum allowable operating pressures; operator \nqualifications and incident response; state damage prevention \nprograms; pipeline control room management; and multiple updates to \nits part 192 regulations to reference new or more recent editions of \nconsensus industry standards governing design, testing, operation, \nmaintenance, and emergency response for gas transmission pipelines.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    In addition, PHMSA regulations at Sec.  195.432 have for nearly \nfour decades imposed a default annual inspection requirement for in-\nservice breakout tanks associated with hazardous liquid pipelines.\\9\\ \nThough PHMSA has amended that provision to provide operators limited \nflexibility to employ alternative inspection intervals derived from \nconsensus standards incorporated by reference in Sec.  195.432, it has \ndeclined to abandon the default annual inspection requirement \\10\\ or \nauthorize the use of risk based inspection procedures for establishing \nthe inspection interval for in-service atmospheric and low-pressure \nsteel above-ground breakout tanks in Sec.  195.432(b).\\11\\ An industry \ntrade group has also criticized PHMSA's reluctance to embrace a risk-\nbased approach to determining inspection intervals on in-service \nbreakout tanks as a missed opportunity to reduce compliance burdens \nwithout diminishing safety.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\9\\ RSPA, ``Transportation of Natural and Other Gas and \nHazardous Liquids by Pipeline: Inspection and Test Intervals,'' 47 \nFR 46852 (Oct 21, 1982).\n    \\10\\ RSPA, ``Pipeline Safety: Adoption of Consensus Standard for \nBreakout Tanks,'' 64 FR 15926, 15932 (Apr 2, 1999) (declining to \nadopt wholesale the risk-based approach to inspection interval \ndetermination set forth in several standards issued by the American \nPetroleum Institute).\n    \\11\\ PHMSA, ``Pipeline Safety: Periodic Updates of Regulatory \nReferences to Technical Standards and Miscellaneous Amendments,'' 80 \nFR 168, 171 (Jan 5, 2015).\n    \\12\\ API ``Supplemental Comments on Docket ID PHMSA-2011-0337; \nPipeline Safety: Periodic Updates of Regulatory References to \nTechnical Standards and Miscellaneous Amendments'' (Apr. 30, 2014), \navailable at: <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/comment/PHMSA-2011-0337-0011\">https://www.regulations.gov/comment/PHMSA-2011-0337-0011</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Review of PHMSA's repair criteria, timelines, and IM requirements \n(as well as inspection intervals for breakout tanks on hazardous liquid \npipelines) is also consistent with stakeholder recommendations and \nPresidential mandates.

PHMSA plans to hold a \npublic meeting in the near future to supplement or to clarify the \nmaterials received in response to this ANPRM.\n    With respect to incremental cost and benefit information, PHMSA is \nseeking per-unit, aggregate, and programmatic (both one-time \nimplementing and recurring) data. Explanation of the bases or \nmethodologies employed in generating cost and benefit data, including \ndata sources and calculations, is valuable so that PHMSA can explain \nthe support for any estimates it is able to provide that accompany a \nproposed rule, and other commenters may weigh in on the validity and \naccuracy of the data. Please also identify the baseline (e.g., a \nparticular edition of a consensus industry standard; widespread \nvoluntary operator practice; or documentation of sample surveys and \nother operator level data or information) from which those incremental \ncosts and benefits arise. When estimates are approximate or uncertain, \nconsider using a range or specifying the distribution in other ways.\n    When responding to a specific question below please note the topic \nletter and question number in your comment. PHMSA will review and \nevaluate all comments received, as well as late-filed comments to the \nextent practicable.\n\nIII. Topics Under Consideration\n\nA. General\n\n    1. Do the anomaly repair criteria, remediation timelines, and IM \nregulations for gas transmission pipelines (part 192, subparts M and O) \nand hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines (Sec. Sec.  195.401 \nand 195.452(h)(4)) strike an appropriate balance between safety \nbenefits and compliance costs? If not, should PHMSA consider amending \nany of those provisions? Please identify any specific regulatory \namendments that merit reconsideration, as well as the technical, \nsafety, and economic reasons supporting those recommended amendments.\n    2. Do anomaly repair criteria, remediation timelines, and IM \nregulations for gas transmission pipelines (part 192, subparts M and O) \nand hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines (Sec. Sec.  195.401 \nand 195.452(h)(4)) accommodate innovative technologies and methods for \nthe discovery, evaluation, and remediation of anomalies? Are there \nspecific, innovative technologies and methods\n\n[[Page 21718]]\n\nwith significant safety or cost-saving potential that are inhibited by \nregulations? Please identify any of those innovative technologies and \nmethods, the categories of pipeline facilities (e.g., hazardous liquid \ntransmission pipelines; gas transmission pipelines) that could employ \nthem, the particular regulatory provisions inhibiting their use, and \nany anticipated compliance cost savings or safety benefits from use of \nthose technologies and methods.\n    3. PHMSA's risk-based IM regulations for gas transmission pipelines \n(part 192, subpart O) and hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines \n(Sec.  195.452(h)(4)) include specific thresholds for particular \nanomaly types and mandated remediation timelines in a manner consistent \nwith traditional, prescriptive regulatory frameworks. Does that \nincorporation of traditional, prescriptive elements within PHMSA's \nrisk-based IM regulations yield safety benefits commensurate with the \nassociated reduction in regulatory flexibility and increase in \ncompliance costs to operators? Are there risks associated with \nprescribed repair conditions and remediation timelines, such as \npersonnel safety and site environmental damage due to repair activity \nor lost product associated with maintenance-related blowdowns and \nevacuation? Should PHMSA consider amending any particular provisions in \nits IM regulations for gas transmission pipelines (part 192, subpart O) \nand hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines (Sec.  195.452) to \nstrike a more appropriate balance between safety benefits and \ncompliance costs? Please identify any specific regulatory amendments \nthat merit consideration, as well as the technical, safety, and \neconomic reasons supporting those recommended amendments.\n    4. Is it appropriate for repair timelines to begin on the date of \n``discovery'' of anomalies on gas transmission (Sec. Sec.  192.714(d) \nand 192.933(b)) and hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines \n(Sec. Sec.  195.401(b)(1) and 195.452(h)(2))? How do operators of those \npipelines determine the moment of discovery? Should PHMSA consider \namending any particular regulatory provisions to improve the clarity or \npractical implementation of its regulations regarding when a \nremediation obligation attaches? Please provide the technical, safety, \nand economic justifications for any suggested revisions.\n    5. Are there any PHMSA interpretations addressing its anomaly \nrepair criteria, remediation timelines, and IM regulations for gas \ntransmission pipelines (part 192, subparts M and O) and hazardous \nliquid or carbon dioxide pipelines (Sec. Sec.  195.401 and \n194.452(h)(4)) \\16\\ impose unjustified compliance costs for different \ncategories of pipeline facilities? If so, which categories of pipelines \nfacilities, and what are those associated compliance costs? Are there \nany interpretations of PHMSA anomaly repair criteria, remediation \ntimelines, and IM regulations that merit codification in parts 192 or \n195 regulations? Please identify any specific regulatory amendments \nthat merit consideration, as well as the technical, safety, and \neconomic reasons supporting those recommended amendments.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\16\\ PHMSA, ``Letters of Interpretation,'' available at: <a href=\"https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/regulations/title49/b/2/1\">https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/regulations/title49/b/2/1</a> (last accessed Mar. 11, \n2025).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    6. Gas transmission, hazardous liquid, and carbon dioxide pipelines \nare not all identical and may merit distinguishable regulatory \nrequirements regarding the discovery, evaluation, and remediation of \nanomalies. Are there substantive differences in the characteristics \n(e.g., pipeline capacity or size; physical processes) of and among the \ndifferent categories of gas transmission and hazardous liquid or carbon \npipelines justifying distinguishable anomaly repair and IM \nrequirements? In light of those differences, what, if any, amendments \nto PHMSA parts 192 and 195 regulations governing anomaly repair \ncriteria, remediation timelines, and IM would be appropriate, and what \nwould be the avoided practicability challenges, compliance costs, or \nsafety impacts from such amendments?\n    7. What types of temporary and permanent repair methods do \noperators of gas transmission, hazardous liquid, and carbon dioxide \npipelines use to comply with PHMSA's anomaly repair criteria, \nremediation timelines, and IM requirements? What percentage of repairs \nare completed using each type of repair method and for which types of \nanomalies? Do operators employ consensus industry standards or \nrecommended practices (e.g., the acceptable remediation methods listed \nin tables 451.6.2(b)-1 and 451.6.2(b)-2 of ASME B31.4-2006) \\17\\ when \ndetermining the appropriate repair method for different types of \nanomalies or categories of gas and hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide \npipelines? What is the average cost of each of those repair methods as \napplied to different types of anomalies or categories of gas \ntransmission, hazardous liquid, or carbon dioxide pipelines?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\17\\ ASME B31.4-2006, ``Pipeline Transportation Systems for \nLiquid Hydrocarbons and Other Liquids'' is incorporated by reference \nin Sec.  195.3 for other purposes. These tables appear as tables \n451.6.2.9-1 and 451.6.2.9-2 in ASME B31.4-2022.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    8. What proportion of small businesses, small organizations, or \nsmall government jurisdictions, as defined in the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 6010 et seq.) and its implementing \nregulations, operate different categories of gas, hazardous liquid, and \ncarbon dioxide pipelines subject to PHMSA anomaly repair criteria, \nremediation timelines, and IM requirements? Please provide information \nabout the nature and types of activities of small businesses and other \nsmall entities operating in midstream gas, hazardous liquid, and carbon \ndioxide pipeline sectors. How should the agency ensure that any \npotential changes to the existing regulations would not \ndisproportionately impact small businesses or other small entities in \nthe sector? Are there alternative regulatory approaches the agency \nshould consider that would achieve its regulatory objectives while \nminimizing any significant economic impact on small businesses or other \nsmall entities?\n    9. Do the annual, incident, and safety-related condition reports \nrequired by parts 191 and 195 regulations require the submission of \nremediation-related information with limited or no safety value for \nparticular categories of gas transmission, hazardous liquid, and carbon \ndioxide pipelines? Is there information required in the reports that is \nduplicative with the information required to be submitted to other \nState or Federal regulatory authorities? What costs would be avoided by \neliminating or revising any such reporting requirements?\n    10. Should PHMSA amend its regulations governing prioritization of \nanomaly remediation on gas transmission (Sec.  192.714) and hazardous \nliquid and carbon dioxide pipelines (Sec.  195.401(b)(3)) to align more \nclosely with its statutory mandate at 49 U.S.C. 108(b) and 49 U.S.C. \n60102(a)(1) to prioritize public safety and protection against risks to \nlife and property above other important policy objectives within the \nscope of its regulatory authority?\n\nB. Repair Criteria and Remediation Timelines for Part 195--Regulated \nHazardous Liquid or Carbon Dioxide Pipelines\n\n    Section 195.401 requires repair within a ``reasonable time'' \nwhenever an operator discovers anomalies on any hazardous liquid or \ncarbon dioxide pipelines that could adversely affect safe operation. If \nan anomaly presents an ``immediate hazard to persons or property,'' the \noperator may not operate the affected portion until the condition\n\n[[Page 21719]]\n\nhas been corrected. Section 195.452(h) establishes remediation \ntimelines for anomalies on HCA segments of hazardous liquid and carbon \ndioxide pipelines that must be repaired immediately, within 60-days, or \nwithin 180-days of discovery (remediation timelines), depending on the \nanomaly characteristics (repair criteria).\n    1. How do operators of different categories of hazardous liquid or \ncarbon dioxide pipelines approach the discovery, evaluation, and \nremediation of anomalies on non-HCA segments in complying with repair \nrequirements at Sec.  195.401? Which elements, if any, do operators \napply from the IM response criteria and remediation timelines at Sec.  \n195.452(h) for anomalies discovered on non-HCA segments? Please \ndescribe typical costs associated with discovery, evaluation, and \nremediation of anomalies on non-HCA segments, with as much specificity \nby anomaly type as possible.\n    2. Are there alternatives or supplements to the anomaly repair \ncriteria and remediation timelines that should be incorporated into \nPHMSA's IM regulations? Are there particular anomaly types whose risks \njustify existing repair criteria and remediation timelines, or even \nbroader repair criteria and more aggressive timelines than specified in \nPHMSA regulations? Conversely, are there anomalies identified in PHMSA \nregulations whose lower risks justify different repair criteria or \nlonger remediation timelines than specified in the regulations? Please \nidentify any specific regulatory amendments that merit consideration, \nas well as the technical, safety, and economic reasons supporting those \nrecommended amendments.\n    3. What methods do operators use to evaluate anomalies when \nmaterial properties of a pipeline segment are unknown? What activities, \nif any, do operators perform to obtain unknown material property \ninformation for anomaly evaluation, and what incremental, per-unit \ncosts are associated with those activities? Are there assumed or \nconservative values used when material properties are unknown, and what \nis the technical basis for those values (e.g., operator-specific \nexperience, or consensus industry standards and recommended practices)? \nHow has obtaining material property information affected the \nclassification of anomalies compared with using assumed or conservative \nvalues?\n    4. Should PHMSA consider adopting predicted failure pressure-based \ncriteria for evaluating anomalies on hazardous liquid and carbon \ndioxide pipelines under part 195? If so, what is an appropriate method \nto predict failure pressure for different types of anomalies on \ndifferent categories of hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines? \nDo hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipeline operators employ a \npredicted failure pressure-based response criterion for any anomalies \non their facilities? Would such an approach be more appropriate for \nsome types of anomalies (e.g., metal loss anomalies) than others? And \nwould such a criterion be appropriate for all part 195-regulated \nhazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines? What amendments to part \n192 regulatory language would be necessary when applied to part 195-\nregulated hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines? Are the \nconsensus industry standards referenced in part 192 regulations \nappropriate for calculating predicted failure pressure on hazardous \nliquid and carbon dioxide pipelines, and what alternatives may be \nappropriate to consider? \\18\\ Please provide the technical, safety, and \neconomic reasons for any suggested regulatory amendments, noting in \nparticular the potential compliance costs and implementation challenges \nassociated with adopting a predicted failure pressure-based repair \ncriterion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\18\\ See AGA, Pipeline Research Committee Project, PR-3-805, ``A \nModified Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded \nPipe'' (Dec. 22, 1989); ASME/ANSI B31G-1991, ``Manual for \nDetermining the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipelines'' (2004).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    5. Are repair criteria and remediation timelines for hazardous \nliquid and carbon dioxide pipelines appropriate for metal loss \nanomalies on a longitudinal seam for HCA and non-HCA segments? How do \noperators evaluate metal loss anomalies on a longitudinal seam? Are \nthere innovative technologies or methods for improved evaluation of \nmetal loss anomalies on a longitudinal seam that could justify \namendments to the repair criteria for HCA segments at Sec.  195.452? \nPlease identify any specific regulatory amendments that merit \nreconsideration, as well as the technical, safety, and economic reasons \nsupporting those recommended amendments.\n    6. Are repair criteria and remediation timelines for hazardous \nliquid and carbon dioxide pipelines appropriate for dents and \nmechanical damage anomalies on HCA and non-HCA segments? How do \noperators evaluate dent and mechanical damage anomalies? Are there \ninnovative technologies or methods (e.g., engineering critical \nassessments, or ECAs) for improved evaluation of dents and mechanical \ndamage anomalies that could justify adjustment of the repair criteria \nfor such anomalies? What ECA methodologies (e.g., API RP 1183 \\19\\) or \nelements thereof, such as safety factors, and finite element analysis, \nwould be appropriate for use? What elements and supportive records are \nnecessary for an effective ECA of a dent or mechanical damage anomaly \non a hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline? Are there \ncircumstances (e.g., operating environments; physical characteristics \nof the commodity transported) where ECAs would be an inappropriate or \nchallenging tool for evaluating dents and mechanical damage anomalies \non different categories of hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide \npipelines? Please provide the technical, safety, and economic reasons \nfor any recommended amendments, noting in particular any potential \nprogram implementation costs and unit costs of each ECA conducted, \navoided compliance costs due to deferred repair or for another reason, \nand implementation challenges.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\19\\ API, Recommended Practice 1183, ``Assessment and Management \nof Dents in Pipelines,'' first edition (Nov. 2020) (including Errata \n1 (Jan. 2021) and Addendum 1 (May 2024)) (API RP 1183).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    7. Are repair criteria and remediation timelines for hazardous \nliquid and carbon dioxide pipelines appropriate for dents with metal \nloss or other interacting integrity threats on HCA and non-HCA \nsegments? What technologies or methods could be used to evaluate dent \nanomalies with metal loss and other interacting threats? Are there any \npertinent consensus industry standards or recommended practices that \nmerit evaluation for incorporation by reference in PHMSA regulations? \nPlease identify any specific regulatory amendments that merit \nconsideration, as well as the technical, safety, and economic reasons \nsupporting them.\n\nC. Repair Criteria and Remediation Timelines for Part 192--Regulated \nGas Transmission Pipelines\n\n    1. Are the regulatory requirements at Sec.  192.712(c) governing \nperformance of ECAs for dents and mechanical damage anomalies on gas \ntransmission lines appropriate? \\20\\ Is an ECA an appropriate means of \nevaluating dents and mechanical damage anomalies on pipelines in some \nscenarios but not others? Should PHMSA consider amending any elements \nof the ECA process prescribed at Sec.  192.712(c) to\n\n[[Page 21720]]\n\nstrike a more appropriate balance between safety benefits and costs? \nPlease identify any specific regulatory amendments that merit \nconsideration, as well as the technical, safety, and economic reasons \nsupporting those recommended amendments.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\20\\ PHMSA notes that even as a reviewing court found that PHMSA \nhad not provided adequate discussion of the compliance costs \nassociated with a minimum dent safety factor set forth in ECA \nprocedures at Sec.  192.712(c), the court's decision did not address \nthe safety benefits of PHMSA's choice of safety factor. See \nInterstate Natural Gas Assn. v. PHMSA, 114 F.4th 744, 752-753 (Aug. \n16, 2024).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    2. Should ECA methodologies or elements thereof within consensus \nindustry standards and recommended practices (e.g., API RP 1183) \\21\\ \ninform the ECA requirements in Sec.  192.712? Are the safety factors, \nrequired elements, and supporting records identified in consensus \nindustry standards and recommended practices appropriate to use in \nevaluating dent and mechanical damage anomalies on gas transmission \nlines, or are alternative approaches advisable? Please identify any \nspecific regulatory amendments that merit consideration, as well as the \ntechnical, safety, and economic reasons supporting those recommended \namendments.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\21\\ API, Recommended Practice 1183, ``Assessment and Management \nof Pipeline Dents'' (First edition 2020).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    3. What were the incremental, per-unit costs and benefits \nassociated with establishing an ECA program and subsequently conducting \neach ECA? Were there any cost savings associated with deferred \nremediation due to the ECA?\n    4. Are part 192 repair criteria, remediation timelines, and IM \nrequirements for gas transmission pipelines appropriate for dents with \nmetal loss or other interacting integrity threats? What technologies or \nmethods could be used to evaluate dent anomalies with metal loss and \nother interacting threats? Are there any pertinent consensus industry \nstandards or recommended practices that should be incorporated by \nreference in PHMSA regulations? Please identify any specific regulatory \namendments that merit consideration, as well as the technical, safety, \nand economic reasons supporting those recommended amendments.\n    5. Are the re-assessment frequencies for anomalies on gas \ntransmission pipelines (Sec.  192.712(h)) that have been evaluated \nusing an ECA appropriate? Should PHMSA consider amending those re-\nassessment intervals to strike a more appropriate balance between \nsafety benefits and costs?\n\nD. In-Service Part 195 Regulated Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Breakout \nTanks\n\n    1. How should part 195 regulations address the assessment of and \nremediation of anomalies on in-service breakout tanks? Would \nincorporating the risk-based inspection interval provided for in \nconsensus industry standards (e.g., the fifth edition of API Std 653) \nwithin PHMSA regulations be appropriate for some or all breakout tanks? \n\\22\\ Please identify any specific regulatory amendments that merit \nconsideration, as well as the technical, safety, and economic reasons \nsupporting those recommended amendments.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\22\\ API Standard 653, ``Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration, \nand Reconstruction,'' 5th edition, Nov. 2014 (including addendum 1 \n(Apr. 2018), addendum 2 (May 2020), addendum 3 (Nov. 2023), errata 1 \n(Mar. 2020), and errata 2 (Feb. 2025)), section 6.4.2.2.2, \nSubsequent Internal Inspection Interval.\n\n    Issued in Washington, DC, on May 15, 2025, under the authority \ndelegated in 49 CFR 1.97.\nBenjamin D.

Background\n\n    In the Federal Register of June 11, 2010 (75 FR 33311), FDA \nannounced the availability of a guidance for industry entitled \n``Bioequivalence Recommendations for Specific Products'' that explained \nthe process that would be used to make product-specific guidances \navailable to the public on FDA's website at <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs\">https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs</a>.\n    As described in that guidance, FDA adopted this process as a means \nto develop and disseminate product-specific guidances and provide a \nmeaningful opportunity for the public to consider and comment on those \nguidances. This notice announces the availability of a new draft \nproduct-specific guidance on generic roflumilast topical cream.\n    FDA initially approved new drug application (NDA) 215985 ZORYVE \n(roflumilast) topical cream, 0.3 percent, in July 2022. FDA approved \nNDA 215985 ZORYVE (roflumilast) topical cream, 0.15 percent, in July \n2024. We are now issuing a draft guidance for industry on, among other \nthings, BE recommendations for generic roflumilast topical cream \n(``Draft Guidance on Roflumilast'').\n    In December 2023, Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Arcutis) submitted \na citizen petition requesting, among other things, that FDA not approve \nany ANDA referencing ZORYVE (roflumilast) topical cream, unless certain \ncriteria are met and that FDA issue a product-specific guidance for \nroflumilast topical cream, 0.3 percent, that recommends studies \nconsistent with those requested in the petition (Docket No. FDA-2023-P-\n5364, available at <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>). FDA is reviewing the \nissues raised in the petition and will consider any comments on the \ndraft guidance entitled ``Draft Guidance on Roflumilast'' before \nresponding to the petition. FDA's issuance of the draft guidance on \ngeneric roflumilast topical cream does not represent a final decision \non the issues raised in the petition.\n    This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good \nguidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The draft guidance, when \nfinalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on ``Draft \nGuidance on Roflumilast.'' It does not establish any rights for any \nperson and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an \nalternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable \nstatutes and regulations. As we develop any final guidance on this \ntopic, FDA will consider comments on the applicability of Executive \nOrder 14192, per OMB guidance M-25-20, and in particular, on any costs \nor cost savings.\n\nII. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\n    While this guidance contains no collection of information, it does \nrefer to previously approved FDA collections of information. The \npreviously approved collections of information are subject to review by \nthe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521). The collections of information in 21 \nCFR part 312 for investigational new drugs have been approved under \n0910-0014. The collections of information in 21 CFR part 314 for \napplications for FDA approval to market a new drug and in 21 CFR part \n320 for bioavailability and bioequivalence requirements have been \napproved under OMB control number 0910-0001.\n\nIII. Electronic Access\n\n    Persons with access to the internet may obtain the draft guidance \nat <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs\">https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents\">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.\n\n    Dated: May 13, 2025.\nGrace R.

Background\n\n    In the Federal Register of June 11, 2010 (75 FR 33311), FDA \nannounced the availability of a guidance for industry entitled \n``Bioequivalence Recommendations for Specific Products'' that explained \nthe process that would be used to make product-specific guidances \navailable to the public on FDA's website at <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs\">https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs</a>.\n    As described in that guidance, FDA adopted this process as a means \nto develop and disseminate product-specific guidances and provide a \nmeaningful opportunity for the public to consider and comment on those \nguidances. This notice announces the availability of a new draft \nproduct-specific guidance on generic fluticasone propionate nasal \nspray, metered.\n    FDA initially approved new drug application (NDA) 209022 XHANCE \n(fluticasone propionate) nasal spray, metered, in September 2017. We \nare now issuing a draft guidance for industry on, among other things, \nBE recommendations for generic fluticasone propionate nasal spray,\n\n[[Page 21782]]\n\nmetered (``Draft Guidance on Fluticasone Propionate'').\n    In May 2021, Optinose US, Inc. (OptiNose) submitted a citizen \npetition requesting, among other things, that FDA not approve an ANDA \nreferencing XHANCE (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray, metered, \nunless the applicant demonstrates bioequivalence and therapeutic \nequivalence through certain studies, and that FDA issue a product-\nspecific guidance for fluticasone propionate nasal spray, metered, that \nrecommends studies consistent with those requested in the petition. \n(Docket No. FDA-2021-P-0530, available at <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>). \nFDA is reviewing the issues raised in the petition and will consider \nany comments on the draft guidance entitled ``Draft Guidance on \nFluticasone Propionate'' before responding to the petition. FDA's \nissuance of the draft guidance on generic fluticasone propionate nasal \nspray, metered does not represent a final decision on the issues raised \nin the petition.\n    This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good \nguidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The draft guidance, when \nfinalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on ``Draft \nGuidance on Fluticasone Propionate.'' It does not establish any rights \nfor any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an \nalternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable \nstatutes and regulations. As we develop any final guidance on this \ntopic, FDA will consider comments on the applicability of Executive \nOrder 14192, per OMB guidance M-25-20, and in particular, on any costs \nor cost savings.\n\nII. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\n    While this guidance contains no collection of information, it does \nrefer to previously approved FDA collections of information. The \npreviously approved collections of information are subject to review by \nthe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521). The collections of information in 21 \nCFR part 312 for investigational new drugs have been approved under OMB \ncontrol number 0910-0014. The collections of information in 21 CFR part \n314 for applications for FDA approval to market a new drug and in 21 \nCFR part 320 for bioavailability and bioequivalence requirements have \nbeen approved under OMB control number 0910-0001.\n\nIII. Electronic Access\n\n    Persons with access to the internet may obtain the draft guidance \nat <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs\">https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents\">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.\n\n    Dated: May 13, 2025.\nGrace R.

FRA assigned \nthe petition Docket Number FRA-2025-0045.\n    Specifically, CSXT requests to retire the Rigby West signal \nlocation at milepost (MP) PLD-15.10 in Scarborough, Maine, on its \nPortland Subdivision. CSXT additionally requests approval to retire \ntrack control operations and extend other than main track limits from \nMP PLD-15.10 to control point (CP) Cooks at MP PLD-16.30.\n    In support of the request, CSXT explains that, with the Rigby West \nsignal in service, whenever train crews need to pull a train west out \nof Rigby Yard for headroom, they must contact the dispatcher and \nrequest the westbound signal be cleared. Therefore, retiring the Rigby \nWest signal would reduce these radio communications, which would allow \nboth dispatchers and train crews ``to focus on critical operational and \nsafety-related communications in and out of Rigby Yard.'' Radio \ncommunications would then ``remain focused on essential dispatching and \noperational duties.'' The request to extend other than main track \nlimits would create more track space for switching/headroom operations.\n    A copy of the petition, as well as any written communications \nconcerning the petition, is available for review online at \n<a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>.\n    Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings \nby submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate \nscheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since \nthe facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party \ndesires an opportunity for oral comment and a public hearing, they \nshould notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and \nspecify the basis for their request.\n    Communications received by June 20, 2025 will be considered by FRA \nbefore final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be \nconsidered if practicable.\n\nPrivacy Act\n\n    Anyone can search the electronic form of any written communications \nand comments received into any of FRA's dockets by the name of the \nindividual submitting the comment (or signing the document, if \nsubmitted on behalf of an association, business, labor union, etc.). \nUnder 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments from the public to better \ninform its processes. DOT posts these comments, without edit, including \nany personal information the commenter provides, to \n<a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</a>, as described in the system of records notice (DOT/\nALL-14 FDMS), which can be reviewed at <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/privacy\">https://www.transportation.gov/privacy</a>.

Table of Abbreviations\n\nCFR Code of Federal Regulations\nDHS Department of Homeland Security\nFR Federal Register\nNPRM Notice of proposed rulemaking\nSec.  Section\nU.S.C. United States Code\n\nII. Background, Purpose, and Legal Basis\n\n    On June 27, 2024, an organization notified the Coast Guard that it \nwill be conducting a Festival of Sail event in Duluth, MN from July 10-\nJuly 13, 2025. Hazards from spectator vessels and the limited \nmaneuverability of the sailing vessels exist. The Captain of the Port \nDuluth (COTP) has determined that potential hazards associated with the \nparade of sail would be a safety concern for anyone within the route of \nthe parade.\n    The purpose of this rulemaking is to ensure the safety of vessels \nand the navigable waters within the parade route before, during, and \nafter the scheduled event, as well as within a more constrained \ndesignated area for the duration of the multi-day event and\n\n[[Page 21706]]\n\naround each vessel. The Coast Guard is proposing this rulemaking under \nauthority in 46 U.S.C. 70041.\n\nIII. Discussion of Proposed Rule\n\n    The COTP is proposing to establish a temporary special local \nregulation from 9 a.m. on July 10, 2025 through 9 p.m. on July 13, \n2025.\n    The temporary special local regulation will cover all navigable \nwaters encompassed within the staging area and parade route from 9 a.m. \nto 2 p.m. on July 10, 2025. This will include all waters of Lake \nSuperior and Duluth Harbor bounded by Rice's Point to the west and \nDuluth to the north, and then within the following boundaries: \nbeginning at position 46[deg]46'48.36'' N, 092[deg]05'16.44'' W; then \nacross Duluth Harbor and turning north to the Duluth Lift Bridge; then \nout the Duluth Harbor Entrance; then northwest back to the north Duluth \nEntrance Light, through the canal, then along Minnesota Point; then \nentering and encompassing the Minnesota Slip; then back out the slip; \nand then back to the starting point. Additionally, the special local \nregulation will cover all waters in which the tall ships will be moored \nfrom 9 a.m. on July 10, 2025 through 9 p.m. on July 13, 2025. The zone \nwill cover all waters encompassed by a projection extending out \nsoutheast from the dock wall along Harbor Drive and southwest from S \nLake Avenue. The regulatory text below provides exact coordinates for \nthe zones. No vessel or person who is not approved prior to the event \nwould be permitted to enter the established zones without obtaining \npermission from the COTP or a designated representative. The duration \nof the zones is intended to ensure the safety of vessels and these \nnavigable waters before, during, and after the Parade of Sail on July \n10, 2025 until the conclusion of the Festival of Sail on July 13, 2025.\n    The regulatory text we are proposing appears at the end of this \ndocument.\n\nIV. Regulatory Analyses\n\n    We developed this proposed rule after considering numerous statutes \nand Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our \nanalyses based on a number of these statutes and Executive orders.\n\nA. Regulatory Planning and Review\n\n    Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the \ncosts and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if \nregulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize \nnet benefits. This NPRM has not been designated a ``significant \nregulatory action'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. \nAccordingly, the NPRM has not been reviewed by the Office of Management \nand Budget (OMB).\n    This regulatory action determination is based on the availability \nof the Superior Harbor entrance as an alternate entry into Superior \nBay, the limited size and short time frame of the special local \nregulation, and the estimated number of spectator vessels around the \nDuluth Harbor entrance for the event. The Coast Guard will issue a \nBroadcast Notice to Mariners via VHF-FM marine channel 16 about the \nzone, and the rule would allow vessels to seek permission to enter the \nzone.\n\nB. Impact on Small Entities\n\n    The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as \namended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of \nregulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term ``small \nentities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations \nthat are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their \nfields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than \n50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this \nproposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities.\n    While some owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the \nsafety zone may be small entities, for the reasons stated in section \nIV.A above, this proposed rule would not have a significant economic \nimpact on any vessel owner or operator.\n    If you think that your business, organization, or governmental \njurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this proposed rule \nwould have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment \n(see ADDRESSES) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to \nwhat degree this rule would economically affect it.\n    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small \nentities in understanding this proposed rule. If the proposed rule \nwould affect your small business, organization, or governmental \njurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or \noptions for compliance, please call or email the person listed in the \nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section. The Coast Guard will not \nretaliate against small entities that question or complain about this \nproposed rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.\n\nC. Collection of Information\n\n    This proposed rule would not call for a new collection of \ninformation under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-\n3520).\n\nD. Federalism and Indian Tribal Governments\n\n    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132 \n(Federalism), if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on \nthe relationship between the National Government and the States, or on \nthe distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels \nof government. We have analyzed this proposed rule under that Order and \nhave determined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism \nprinciples and preemption requirements described in Executive Order \n13132.\n    Also, this proposed rule does not have tribal implications under \nExecutive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal \nGovernments) because it would not have a substantial direct effect on \none or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and \nresponsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. If \nyou believe this proposed rule has implications for federalism or \nIndian tribes, please call or email the person listed in the FOR \nFURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section.\n\nE. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act\n\n    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) \nrequires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary \nregulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may \nresult in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in \nthe aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for \ninflation) or more in any one year. Though this proposed rule would not \nresult in such an expenditure, we do discuss the potential effects of \nthis proposed rule elsewhere in this preamble.\n\nF. Environment\n\n    We have analyzed this proposed rule under Department of Homeland \nSecurity Directive 023-01, Rev. 1, associated implementing \ninstructions, and Environmental Planning COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), \nwhich guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have made \na preliminary determination that this action is one of a category of \nactions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant \neffect on\n\n[[Page 21707]]\n\nthe human environment.

Please reference Docket ID Number [SSA-2025-0029] in \nyour submitted response.\n\n[[Page 21818]]\n\n    I. The information collections below are pending at SSA. SSA will \nsubmit them to OMB within 60 days from the date of this notice. To be \nsure we consider your comments, we must receive them no later than July \n21, 2025. Individuals can obtain copies of the collection instrument by \nwriting to the above email address.\n    1. Consent for Release of Information and Consent for Disclosure of \nRecords Protected Under the Privacy Act (Privacy and Disclosure of \nOfficial Records and Information and Availability of Information and \nRecords to the Public)--20 CFR 401.40(b)&(c), 401.45, 401.55(b), \n401.65(a), 401.100; 20 CFR 401.130; and 20 CFR 402-0960-0566.\n    Within the Privacy and Disclosure of Official Records and \nInformation regulations, SSA has established methods through which the \npublic can provide consent for release of records under the Privacy Act \nof 1974. The public can also request records accessible through the \nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA). We collect the necessary information \nfor these requests through written correspondence, including the Form \nSSA-3288; other writings, including non-SSA forms often used by large \nemployers, that incorporate SSA's consent requirements; or the Form \nSSA-3288-OP1 via a webform application linked on SSA's Privacy Program \nwebsite. The Form SSA-3288-OP1 allows an individual to consent to and \nauthorize SSA to disclose specific types of records that an individual \ncan alternatively request through other writings and written \ncorrespondence; however, an individual can consent to and authorize SSA \nto disclose a broader range of types of records when using other \nwritings and written correspondence (other than Form SSA-3288-OP1).\n\nConsent for Release of Records\n\n    SSA obtains the required consent(s) (with certain exceptions \nspecified by law) from anyone requesting information in SSA systems of \nrecords about another individual. We will not release information \nrequested about an individual until we obtain the required consent from \nthat individual. Under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a (b)), \nindividuals may give SSA written consent to disclose their personal \ninformation to a third party of their choosing. In addition, \nindividuals may have multiple needs for the disclosure of their \npersonal information, such as for qualification for a mortgage or \npreemployment screenings. SSA uses the following forms for obtaining \nrequired consent:\n    (a) Form SSA-3288 (Consent for Release of Information): Form SSA-\n3288 is SSA's preferred paper form for requests for disclosure of \ninformation based on the consent of the subject of record. Respondents \ncan download the SSA-3288 from <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/forms\">www.ssa.gov/forms</a>, obtain a copy at a \nlocal SSA field office, or request SSA mail a copy to them directly. \nUse of this form ensures compliance with SSA consent regulations at 20 \nCFR 401.100. SSA also collects consent on other writings, including \nnon-SSA forms which large employers often use, that incorporate SSA's \nconsent requirements.\n    (b) Form SSA-3288-OP1 (Consent for Disclosure of Records Protected \nUnder the Privacy Act): Form SSA-3288-OP1 complies with the CASES Act, \nOMB M-21-04, and SSA consent regulations at 20 CFR 401.100. The CASES \nAct directed OMB to develop templates for, among other things, \nelectronic consents for SSA to disclose records protected by the \nPrivacy Act of 1974 to third parties. OMB implemented that statutory \ndirective in M-21-04. SSA developed the SSA-3288-OP1 pursuant to the \nCASES Act and M-21-04. The public can access the webform application \nthat populates Form SSA-3288-OP1 online by selecting the ``Submit an \nElectronic Consent to Disclose Records'' link found at <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/privacy\">www.ssa.gov/privacy</a>. The public can also find the ``Submit an Electronic Consent to \nDisclose Records'' page with the link to the SSA-3288-OP1 by typing in \nrelevant search terms at <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov\">www.ssa.gov</a>.\n    The respondents are individuals consenting to, authorizing, and \nrequesting SSA disclosure of their records protected by the Privacy Act \nof 1974 to third parties.\n    Type of Request: Revision of an OMB-approved information \ncollection.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                              Average\n                                                                          Average burden     Estimated      theoretical    Average wait    Total annual\n            Modality of completion               Number of    Frequency    per response    total annual     hourly cost    time in field    opportunity\n                                                respondents  of response     (minutes)    burden (hours)      amount          office      cost (dollars)\n                                                                                                            (dollars) *    (minutes) **         **\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na.

There is no actual charge to\n  respondents to complete the application.\n\n    2. Enterprise Scheduling System (ESS)--0960-0828.\n    The Enterprise Scheduling System (ESS) allows for both customer \nself-scheduling and technician-assisted scheduling through an \nelectronic scheduling tool. The first ESS release specifically allowed \nself-scheduling for enumeration services. However, we are now extending \nits current functionality, enabling customers and technicians to: \nschedule, reschedule, or cancel enumeration appointments for new or \nreplacement Social Security cards; and complete Post-Entitlement (PE) \nactions, such as changing a Representative Payee, processing non-\nreceipt of payment, updating an SSI record, or submitting evidence. In \naddition, ESS will allow technicians the ability to schedule, \nreschedule or cancel PE appointments on behalf of customers.\n\n[[Page 21819]]\n\n    Customers use ESS to schedule an appointment to obtain a new SSN or \na replacement Social Security card or for assistance with a PE action. \nESS offers customers the following services:\n    <bullet> Appointment scheduling.\n    <bullet> Electronic communication.\n    <bullet> Workload evaluation/planning/management.\n    <bullet> Research.\n    <bullet> Regulatory Mandated/Compliance.\n    <bullet> General purpose statistics.\n    ESS facilitates both customer self-scheduling and technician \nscheduling, allowing SSA to collect essential information from \ncustomers, including their name, Social Security number, zip code, \ntelephone number, and email address. Additionally, customers have the \noption to consent to electronic messaging or to opt out, as well as \nspecify their preferred method of communication (email or text), \nlanguage preference, preferred service office, and appointment day and \ntime preferences. SSA uses this information to schedule in-office, \nphone, or video appointments for processing enumeration and PE actions. \nCustomers scheduling their PE appointments through a technician have \nthe option to create a one-time passcode, enabling them to securely \nupdate their appointment online. The technician will document this one-\ntime passcode along with the customer's other appointment preferences.\n    Customers begin the process by accessing <a href=\"http://SSA.gov\">SSA.gov</a> and engaging an \nonline questionnaire to determine the nature of their business. If \napplications are available for customers to self-serve, the system \nroutes them to those applications to complete their business. If not, \ncustomers are given the option to self-schedule an appointment through \nESS. If the customer moves forward, the system directs them to create a \ncredential using <a href=\"http://Login.gov\">Login.gov</a> or ID.me. Once they complete credentialing, \ncustomers access ESS to complete required screens and fields to select \na date and time for an appointment with an SSA field office (FO) to \nprovide the proofs necessary to obtain a replacement or original SSN \ncard or complete a PE action. Upon completing the required screens and \nfields, the system presents customers with a screen to review and \nsubmit all of the data they input regarding the requested appointment. \nIf the customer enters everything accurately, the system allows the \ncustomer to confirm their information and schedules their appointment.\n    If customers encounter issues with ESS, they may contact SSA by \nphone to have an FO or Telephone Service Center technician schedule \ntheir appointment. Technicians follow existing processes and policies \nto identify the caller as a legitimate customer, and converse with the \ncustomer to determine the nature of their business and if they require \nan appointment. If the technician determines the customer needs an \nappointment, the technician accesses ESS and completes the required \nscreens and fields for the enumeration or PE appointment. Once the \ntechnician completes the ESS screens, the technician can review all of \nthe information the customer provided with the customer. If the \ncustomer indicates it is correct the technician submits and schedules \nthe appointment.\n    We conduct this information collection each time a customer \naccesses the online tool or contacts SSA by phone to schedule an \nappointment. The respondents are individuals looking to schedule their \nown SSA visit using ESS.\n    Type of Request: Revision of an OMB-approved information \ncollection.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                         Average        Average wait\n                                                                  Average burden   Estimated total     theoretical        time for        Total annual\n    Modality of completion          Number of      Frequency of    per response     annual burden      hourly cost       teleservice    opportunity cost\n                                   respondents       response        (minutes)         (hours)      amount (dollars)  center (minutes)    (dollars) **\n                                                                                                            *                **\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nESS--Internet.................  3,000,000.......               1               5  250,000.........  * $22.98........  ................  *** $5,745,000\nESS--Technician...............  150,000.........               1               3  7,500...........  * 22.98.........  ** 22...........  *** 1,436,250\n                               -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Totals....................  3,150,000.......  ..............  ..............  257,500.........  ................  ................  *** 7,181,250\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* We based this figure by averaging both the average DI payments based on SSA's current FY 2025 data (<a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/2024FactSheet.pdf\">https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/2024FactSheet.pdf</a>), and the average U.S. worker's hourly wages, as reported by Bureau of Labor Statistics data (Occupational Employment and Wage\n  Statistics).\n** We based this figure by averaging the average FY 2025 wait times for field offices and teleservice centers, based on SSA's current management\n  information data.\n*** This figure does not represent actual costs that SSA is imposing on recipients of Social Security payments to complete this application; rather,\n  these are theoretical opportunity costs for the additional time respondents will spend to complete the application.

SSA uses Form SSA-8508-BK to conduct these reviews, collecting \ninformation on operating efficiency; the quality of underlying \npolicies; and the effect of incorrect payments. SSA also uses the data \nto determine SSI program payment accuracy rates, which are a service \ndelivery goals. SSA selects a stratified random sample of recipients \neach month who received payments during the sample period to conduct \nthese reviews. The SSA reviewer then reviews the selected case files \nprior to preparing an initial letter contacting the respondent to set \nup an interview. The initial letter informs the respondent of the \nreview and includes a checklist with any requested documentation for \nthe phone-based interview. During the interview, the SSA reviewer \nredevelops and verifies all non-medical factors of eligibility and \npayment amount, asks the sampled individuals questions related to the \nstatus of eligibility factors during the review period, then requests \nthe respondent mail in any necessary documentation (listed on the \ninitial letter). During the interview, the SSA reviewer documents \nresponses on the electronic SSA-8508-BK (or e8508), a stand-alone Excel \napplication that resides in the reviewer's government-issued personal \ncomputer. If the system is not accessible for some reason, the reviewer \nuses the paper SSA-8508-BK instead. The respondents are recipients of \nSSI payments selected for the quality reviews\n\n[[Page 21820]]\n\n    Type of Request: Revision of an OMB-approved information \ncollection.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                              Average\n                                                                                          Average burden     Estimated      theoretical    Total annual\n                 Modality of completion                      Number of     Frequency of    per response    total annual     hourly cost     opportunity\n                                                            respondents      response        (minutes)    burden (hours)      amount      cost (dollars)\n                                                                                                                            (dollars) *         **\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSSA-8508-BK (paper interview)...........................             215               1              60             215        * $13.30       ** $2,860\ne8508 (electronic interview)............................           4,085               1              60           4,085         * 13.30       ** 54,331\n                                                         -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Totals..............................................           4,300  ..............  ..............           4,300  ..............      ** $57,191\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* We based this figure on the average DI payments based on SSA's current data (<a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/2024FactSheet.pdf\">https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/2024FactSheet.pdf</a>).\n*** This figure does not represent actual costs that SSA is imposing on recipients of Social Security payments to complete this application; rather,\n  these are theoretical opportunity costs for the additional time respondents will spend to complete the application.

NMFS will accept anonymous \ncomments (enter ``NA'' in the required fields if you wish to remain \nanonymous).\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Whitney, 907-206-6783.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the \nBSAI exclusive economic zone according to the Fishery Management Plan \nfor Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area \n(FMP) prepared and recommended by the North Pacific Fishery Management \nCouncil under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). Regulations governing \nfishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H \nof 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.\n    NMFS closed directed fishing for POP in the Bering Sea subarea of \nthe BSAI under Sec.  679.20(d)(1)(iii) in the final 2025 and 2026 \nharvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (90 FR 12640, March \n18, 2025).\n    NMFS has determined that as of May 14, 2025, approximately 5,500 \nmetric tons of POP remain in the directed fishing allowance. Therefore, \nin accordance with Sec.  679.25(a)(1)(i), (a)(2)(i)(C), and \n(a)(2)(iii)(D), and to fully utilize the 2025 total allowable catch of \nPOP in the Bering Sea subarea of the BSAI, NMFS is terminating the \nprevious closure and is opening directed fishing for POP in Bering Sea \nsubarea of the BSAI, effective 1200 hours, A.l.t., May 19, 2025, \nthrough 2400 hours, A.l.t., December 31, 2025. This will provide \nharvest opportunities for and enhance the socioeconomic well-being of \nharvesters dependent on POP in this area.\n    The Administrator, Alaska Region considered the following factors \nin reaching this decision: (1) the current catch of POP in the BSAI; \nand (2) the harvest capacity and stated intent of future harvesting \npatterns of vessels participating in this fishery.\n\nClassification\n\n    NMFS issues this action pursuant to section 305(d) of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act. This action is required by 50 CFR part 679, which was \nissued pursuant to section 304(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and is \nexempt from review under Executive Order 12866.\n    Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), there is good cause to waive prior \nnotice and an opportunity for public comment on this action, as notice \nand comment would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest, \nas it would prevent NMFS from responding to the most recent fisheries \ndata in a timely fashion and would delay the opening of directed \nfishing for POP in the Bering Sea subarea of the BSAI. NMFS was unable \nto publish a notice providing time for public comment because the most \nrecent, relevant data on POP only became available as of May 14, 2025.\n    The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA also finds good \ncause to waive the 30-day delay in the effective date of this action \nunder 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is based upon the reasons \nprovided above for waiver of prior notice and opportunity for public \ncomment.\n    Without this inseason adjustment, NMFS could not allow the directed \nfishery for POP in the Bering Sea subarea of the BSAI to be harvested \nin an expedient manner. Under Sec.  679.25(c)(2), interested persons \nare invited to submit written comments on this action to the above \naddress until June 5, 2025.\n\n    Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.\n\n    Dated: May 16, 2025.\nKelly Denit,\nDirector, Office of Sustainable Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries \nService.\n[FR Doc. 2025-09165 Filed 5-19-25; 4:15 pm]\nBILLING CODE 3510-22-P\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"

The \nlatest results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress \n(NAEP), which showed that 4th and 8th grade students are lagging far \nbehind in literacy, highlight the urgent need to address this critical \nissue. Reading scores have reached historic lows, with the most notable \ndrops observed among students in the bottom quartile of performers.\\1\\ \nDespite billions of dollars in annual federal education funding, these \nscores show no signs of improvement, even with record investments in \nprograms intended to enhance the educational experience of American \nstudents.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\1\\ National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) National \nAssessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). ``Explore Results of the \n2024 NAEP Reading Assessment.'' <a href=\"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g4_8/\">https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g4_8/</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Federal education spending must now prioritize a vital and \nfoundational goal: ensuring that every student in America becomes \nproficient in reading. Effective evidence-based literacy instruction \nshould be supported by strong or moderate evidence that relates to \nexplicit, systematic, and intentional instruction in phonological \nawareness, phonic decoding, vocabulary, language structure, reading \nfluency, and reading comprehension.\n    It is essential that taxpayer dollars focus on initiatives that \ndirectly benefit students through effective literacy instruction and \nensure that educator pipelines at the postsecondary level keep \nevidence-based literacy at the forefront while preparing the educators \nof tomorrow. It is time for the United States to refocus its education \ninvestments on the most essential skill a student can acquire: \nliteracy. The ability to read is the foundation for all learning, \nunlocking opportunities for academic, professional, and personal \nachievement and strengthening critical thinking skills essential to \nlifelong success.\n    Proposed Priority: Projects or proposals to do one or more of the \nfollowing:\n    (a) Advance, increase, or expand evidence-based literacy \ninstruction (as defined in this notice), or\n    (b) Focus on evidence-based literacy instruction (as defined in \nthis notice).\n\nProposed Priority 2: Expanding Education Choice\n\n    Background: When our conventional public education system fails \nsuch a large segment of society, it hinders our national \ncompetitiveness and imperils families and communities. Education choice \nempowers parents and families to seek the best learning environment for \ntheir children, fostering innovation in education models that address \nthe unique needs of students across the country. Education choice \nensures that every child has the opportunity to access a high-quality \neducation and pursue the American Dream, regardless of their zip code.\n    Education choice gives parents, who understand their children's \nneeds best, the ability to make informed decisions about their \nchildren's education paths. For this reason, more than a dozen States \nhave enacted universal K-12 scholarship programs,\\2\\ allowing \nfamilies--rather than the government--to choose the best educational \nsetting for their children. These States have highlighted the most \npromising avenue for education reform: education choice for families \nand competition for residentially assigned, government-run public \nschools. Today, almost 22 million students can take advantage of \nalternatives to conventional public schools through education \nchoice.\\3\\ The growing body of rigorous research demonstrates that \nwell-designed education-choice programs improve student achievement and \ncause nearby public schools to improve their performance.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\2\\ Stanford, L., M.

Ensuring that students at every age can pursue \nan education that aligns with their unique needs and career goals is \ncrucial in the pursuit of educational freedom. This can be achieved \nthrough flexible options such as competency-based education that allows \nstudents to progress through learning at their own pace, short-term \nworkforce-aligned programs or three-year or less degrees, and distance \neducation. Access to education choice in the pursuit of higher \neducation and career readiness is essential.\n    It is crucial that the Department prioritize the expansion and \nstrengthening of education choice programs at every level. By doing so, \nwe can ensure that all families, regardless of their background or \nlocation, have access to the educational opportunities that best serve \ntheir children's unique needs.\n    Proposed Priority: Projects or proposals that will do one or more \nof the following:\n    (a) Increase access to public charter schools and other innovative \nschool models, such as public laboratory schools, public microschools, \ncourse-based choice, or regional academies, which may include one or \nmore of the following:\n    (i) Efforts to expand or replicate existing charter schools that \nhave a record of improving students' academic achievement or have a \nspecific focus on one or more of the following:\n    (1) Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), \nincluding computer science,\n    (2) Career and technical education,\n    (3) Evidence-based literacy instruction,\n    (4) Serving students with disabilities and special needs,\n    (5) Patriotic education, or\n\n[[Page 21712]]\n\n    (6) Classical education.\n    (ii) Multi-year plans to create new charter schools.\n    (iii) Providing Technical Assistance to new or existing charter \nschools related to authorization, operation, construction, or other \nrelevant areas, including navigating State and local statutes and \nregulations.\n    (iv) Opening opportunities for new or existing charter schools to \naccess resources that are currently only available to, or primarily \naccessed by, district schools in their area.\n    (b) Expand access to K-12 school options through open enrollment or \ncourse-based choice.\n    (c) Support dissemination of information for all education choice \noptions for students, including private school enrollment, education \nsavings accounts, tax credit scholarships, home-based learning and \nhomeschooling, learning pods and co-ops, public charter schools, and \ndistrict public schools through open enrollment or course-based choice.\n    (d) Support state or local development or implementation of \neducation savings accounts.\n    (e) Support dissemination of information about education savings \naccounts.\n    (f) Support families in educating students through home-based \neducation programs, which may include one or more of the following:\n    (i) Support for online learning communities, or\n    (ii) Assistance with understanding of State and local requirements \nfor homeschooling.\n    (g) Provide or expand access to dual or concurrent enrollment \nprograms (as defined in 20 U.S.C. 7801(15)) or early college high \nschools (as defined in 20 U.S.C. 7801(17)) or other programs where \nsecondary school students begin earning credit toward a postsecondary \ndegree or industry-recognized credential prior to high school \ngraduation.\n    (h) Expand access to education services that accelerate learning \nsuch as high-impact tutoring.\n    (i) Expand access to military schools or academies.\n    (j) Expand access to one or more of the following at the high \nschool or postsecondary level:\n    (i) Distance education,\n    (ii) Competency-based or skills-based education,\n    (iii) Pre-apprenticeships,\n    (iv) Apprenticeships,\n    (iv) Work-based learning, or\n    (v) Shortened time-to-degree models.\n    (k) Expand access to part-time coursework and career preparation.\n    (l) Expand access to programs or coursework that lead to in-demand, \nindustry-recognized credentials.\n\nProposed Priority 3: Returning Education to the States\n\n    Background: The growth of federal education bureaucracy has created \nmassive costs, but few educational benefits. Through this priority, the \nSecretary is empowering States and Tribes to take the lead in \nformulating, developing, and implementing policies that best serve \nstudents, families, and educators within their communities. As the \nDepartment transitions toward closure, it is more critical than ever \nfor States to rise to the occasion and lead with urgency and vision.\n    Families deserve an education system that reflects the unique needs \nof the communities in which they live. One-size-fits-all mandates from \nthe federal government create obstacles, limiting the ability of State, \nTribal, local, and institutional leaders to make decisions in the best \ninterest of their students and their workforce. Furthermore, \ncentralized planning and oversight power at the federal level adds \nunnecessary layers of bureaucracy, siphoning resources away from the \nclassrooms that need them most.\n    The 10th Amendment wisely reserved constitutional authority for \neducation to the States in order to limit federal overreach. Education \ndecisions should be made at the State level, where local needs, \npriorities, and circumstances can be fully understood and addressed. \nThis priority is a critical step in achieving the broader goal of \neducational excellence for all students. States must be empowered to \ncreate opportunity through policies that are more responsive, \neffective, and aligned with the needs of their communities, in order to \n``empower States to take charge and advocate for and implement what is \nbest for students, families, and educators in their communities.'' \\5\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\5\\ <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/statement-president-trumps-executive-order-return-power-over-education-states-and-local-communities\">https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/statement-president-trumps-executive-order-return-power-over-education-states-and-local-communities</a>.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Proposed Priority: Projects or proposals that will be carried out \nby one or more of the following:\n    (a) State educational agencies (as defined in 20 U.S.C. 7801(49)),\n    (b) Governors,\n    (c) State workforce development agencies or boards,\n    (d) State vocational rehabilitation agencies,\n    (e) State higher education agencies (as defined in 20 U.S.C. \n1003(22),\n    (f) Entities identified, designated, or endorsed by a Governor or \nchief State education official for purposes of implementing the project \nor proposal,\n    (g) An Indian Tribe (as defined in 25 U.S.C. 5304(e)), Tribal \norganization (as defined in 25 U.S.C. 5304(l)), or Tribal educational \nagency (as defined in 20 U.S.C. 7452(b)(3)), or\n    (h) Consortia of the entities identified under this priority.\n\nTypes of Priorities\n\n    When inviting applications for a competition using one or more \npriorities, we designate the type of each priority as absolute, \ncompetitive preference, or invitational through a notice in the Federal \nRegister. The effect of each type of priority follows:\n    Absolute priority: Under an absolute priority, we consider only \napplications that meet the priority (34 CFR 75.105(c)(3)).\n    Competitive preference priority: Under a competitive preference \npriority, we give competitive preference to an application by (1) \nawarding additional points, depending on the extent to which the \napplication meets the priority (34 CFR 75.105(c)(2)(i)); or (2) \nselecting an application that meets the priority over an application of \ncomparable merit that does not meet the priority (34 CFR \n75.105(c)(2)(ii)).\n    Invitational priority: Under an invitational priority, we are \nparticularly interested in applications that meet the priority. \nHowever, we do not give an application that meets the priority a \npreference over other applications (34 CFR 75.105(c)(1)).\n\nProposed Definitions\n\n    Background: The Secretary proposes the following definitions for \nuse in any Department discretionary grant program in which the proposed \npriorities are used.\n    Computer science means the study of computers and algorithmic \nprocesses, including their principles, their hardware and software \ndesigns, theories, computational thinking, coding, analytics, \napplications, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n    Computer science often includes computer programming or coding as a \ntool to create software, including applications, games, websites, and \ntools to manage or manipulate data; or development and management of \ncomputer hardware and the other electronics related to sharing, \nsecuring, and using digital information. In addition to coding, the \nexpanding field of computer science emphasizes computational thinking \nand interdisciplinary problem-solving to equip students with the skills \nand\n\n[[Page 21713]]\n\nabilities necessary to apply computation to the digital world.\n    Computer science does not involve using computers for everyday \ntasks, such as browsing the internet or using tools like word \nprocessors, spreadsheets, or presentation software. Instead, it focuses \non creating and developing technology, not just utilizing it.\n    Evidence framework means an approach to providing a determination \nabout whether an activity, strategy, or intervention meets each aspect \nof the definition of strong evidence or moderate evidence (as defined \nin 20 U.S.C. 7801(21)(A)(i)(I-II)), as applicable.\n    (a) An evidence framework must include each of the following:\n    (i) Whether a study is experimental, quasi-experimental, or \nneither;\n    (ii) Whether or not a study shows a positive, statistically \nsignificant effect on student outcomes or other relevant outcomes;\n    (iii) Whether or not a study uses outcome measures that demonstrate \nvalidity and reliability, that do not give an unfair advantage to \nparticipants in one condition over another, and that are measured \nconsistently for the groups or participants that are being compared;\n    (iv) Whether or not a study design is otherwise of high quality, \nincluding whether it minimizes factors outside the intervention that \ncould affect student or other relevant outcomes (confounds) and whether \nrandom assignment (if used) was done with integrity; and\n    (v) Whether or not study implementation and analysis is \nappropriate, including whether groups or participants being compared \ndemonstrate baseline equivalence on key individual and other relevant \ncharacteristics, whether differences in baseline equivalence are \nstatistically controlled, and by considering the impact on the validity \nof the study of any changes to the sample over time.\n    (b) An evidence framework may be implemented or verified by one or \nmore of the following:\n    (i) An organization with relevant expertise that has demonstrated \nto the Department that it has a rigorous, transparent (i.e., publicly \naccessible) process for determining each aspect identified in (a);\n    (ii) By peer reviewers with statistical expertise who apply an \nevidence framework consistent with each aspect identified in (a) in \nreviewing support for an applicant's assertion that relevant \ninformation is strong evidence or moderate evidence, as applicable; or\n    (iii) By the Department or peer reviewers with statistical \nexpertise who affirm an applicant's assertion that relevant information \nis strong evidence or moderate evidence because it is supported by \nstudies included in the What Works Clearinghouse in one or more of:\n    (1) a practice guide;\n    (2) an intervention report; or\n    (3) an individual evaluation that is publicly validated as being \naligned with strong evidence or moderate evidence, as applicable.\n    Evidence-based literacy instruction means literacy instruction that \nrelates to explicit, systematic and intentional instruction in \nphonological awareness, phonic decoding, vocabulary, language \nstructure, reading fluency, and reading comprehension; promotes \nknowledge-rich materials; and is backed by one or more of the \nfollowing, as supported by an evidence framework (as defined in this \nnotice):\n    (a) strong evidence, meaning an activity, strategy, or intervention \nthat demonstrates a statistically significant effect on improving \nstudent outcomes or other relevant outcomes based on at least one well-\ndesigned and well-implemented experimental study (strong evidence as \ndefined in 20 U.S.C. 7801(21)(A)(i)(I)) or\n    (b) moderate evidence, meaning an activity, strategy, or \nintervention that demonstrates a statistically significant effect on \nimproving student outcomes or other relevant outcomes based on at least \none well-designed and well-implemented quasi-experimental study \n(moderate evidence as defined in 20 U.S.C. 7801(21)(A)(i)(II)).\n    Note: In any discretionary grant program competition in which the \ndefinition of ``evidence-based literacy instruction'' is used as \nproposed, the Secretary may use the entire definition or one or more of \nthe subparts of the definition that are most relevant for the grant \nprogram competition.\n    Experimental study means a study that is designed to compare \noutcomes between two groups (such as students) that are otherwise \nequivalent except for their assignment to either a treatment group \nreceiving an activity, strategy, intervention, process, product, \npractice, or policy as compared with a control group that does not. \nExperimental studies can support claims of strong evidence. Randomized \ncontrolled trials and single-case design studies are specific types of \nexperimental studies that meet this definition.\n    Quasi-experimental design study means a study using a design that \nattempts to approximate an experimental study by identifying a \ncomparison group that is similar to the treatment group in important \nrespects. Cross-sectional group designs, comparative interrupted time \nseries, difference-in-difference designs, and growth curve designs are \nspecific types of quasi-experimental studies that meet this definition. \nThis type of study can meet the definition of moderate evidence but not \nstrong evidence.\n    Final Priorities and Definitions: The Department will announce the \nfinal priorities and definitions in a document in the Federal Register. \nWe will determine the final priorities and definitions after \nconsidering responses to the proposed priorities and definitions and \nother information available to the Department. This document does not \npreclude us from proposing additional priorities, requirements, or \ndefinitions, subject to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.\n    Note: This document does not solicit applications. In any year in \nwhich we choose to use any of the final priorities and definitions, we \ninvite applications through a notice in the Federal Register.\n\nExecutive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14192\n\nRegulatory Impact Analysis\n\n    Under Executive Order 12866, it must be determined whether this \nregulatory action is ``significant'' and, therefore, subject to the \nrequirements of the Executive order and subject to review by the Office \nof Management and Budget (OMB). Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 \ndefines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely to \nresult in a rule that may--\n    (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, \nor adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the \neconomy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public \nhealth or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or \ncommunities;\n    (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an \naction taken or planned by another agency;\n    (3) Materially alter the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, \nuser fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients \nthereof; or\n    (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal \nmandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in \nthe Executive Order.\n    This proposed regulatory action is not a significant regulatory \naction subject to review by OMB under section 3(f) of Executive Order \n12866.\n    Since this regulatory action is not a significant regulatory action \nunder section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, it is not considered an \n``Executive Order 14192 regulatory action.''\n\n[[Page 21714]]\n\n    We have also reviewed this proposed regulatory action under \nExecutive Order 13563, which supplements and explicitly reaffirms the \nprinciples, structures, and definitions governing regulatory review \nestablished in Executive Order 12866. To the extent permitted by law, \nExecutive Order 13563 requires that an agency--\n    (1) Propose or adopt regulations only upon a reasoned determination \nthat their benefits justify their costs (recognizing that some benefits \nand costs are difficult to quantify);\n    (2) Tailor its regulations to impose the least burden on society, \nconsistent with obtaining regulatory objectives and taking into \naccount--among other things and to the extent practicable--the costs of \ncumulative regulations;\n    (3) In choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, select \nthose approaches that maximize net benefits;\n    (4) To the extent feasible, specify performance objectives, rather \nthan the behavior or manner of compliance a regulated entity must \nadopt; and\n    (5) Identify and assess available alternatives to direct \nregulation, including economic incentives--such as user fees or \nmarketable permits--to encourage the desired behavior, or provide \ninformation that enables the public to make choices.\n    Executive Order 13563 also requires an agency ``to use the best \navailable techniques to quantify anticipated present and future \nbenefits and costs as accurately as possible.'' The Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs of OMB has emphasized that these \ntechniques may include ``identifying changing future compliance costs \nthat might result from technological innovation or anticipated \nbehavioral changes.''\n    We are issuing the proposed priorities and definitions only on a \nreasoned determination that their benefits would justify their minimal \ncosts. Based on the analysis that follows, the Department believes that \nthis regulatory action is consistent with the principles in Executive \nOrder 13563.\n    We also have determined that this regulatory action would not \nunduly interfere with State, local, and Tribal governments in the \nexercise of their governmental functions.\n    In accordance with these Executive orders, the Department has \nassessed the potential costs and benefits, both quantitative and \nqualitative, of this regulatory action. The potential costs are those \nresulting from statutory requirements and those we have determined are \nnecessary for administering the Department's programs and activities.\n\nDiscussion of Costs and Benefits\n\n    The proposed priorities would impose no or minimal costs on \nentities that receive discretionary grant award funds from the \nDepartment. Additionally, the benefits of implementing the proposed \npriorities outweigh any associated costs, to the extent these de \nminimis costs even exist, because these proposed priorities would \nresult in higher quality grant application submissions that directly \nimprove the educational outcomes of all students. These proposed \npriorities and definitions will result in significant benefit to the \npublic by improving educational outcomes for all students and \nultimately increase the future earnings potential of all students.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    \\6\\ Earnings and unemployment rates by educational attainment, \n2023. ``Education pays'': U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (<a href=\"http://bls.gov\">bls.gov</a>).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Application submission and participation in competitive grant \nprograms that might use these proposed priorities and definitions is \nvoluntary. We believe, based on the Department's administrative \nexperience, that entities preparing an application would not need to \nexpend more resources than they otherwise would have in the absence of \nthese proposed priorities. Therefore, any potential costs to applicants \nwould be de minimis. Because the costs of carrying out activities would \nbe paid for with program funds, the costs of implementation would not \nbe a burden for any eligible applicants that earn a grant award, \nincluding small entities. We invite the public to comment on this \ndiscussion of estimated costs and benefits. We are specifically \ninterested in high quality comments supported with quantitative data.\n\nClarity of the Regulations\n\n    Executive Order 12866 and the Presidential memorandum ``Plain \nLanguage in Government Writing'' require each agency to write \nregulations that are easy to understand. The Secretary invites comments \non how to make these proposed priorities and definitions, easier to \nunderstand, including answers to questions such as the following:\n    <bullet> Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly \nstated?\n    <bullet> Do the proposed regulations contain technical terms or \nother wording that interferes with their clarity?\n    <bullet> Does the format of the proposed regulations (grouping and \norder of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce \ntheir clarity?\n    <bullet> Would the proposed regulations be easier to understand if \nwe divided them into more (but shorter) sections?\n    <bullet> Could the description of the proposed regulations in the \nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this preamble be more helpful in \nmaking the proposed regulations easier to understand? If so, how?\n    <bullet> What else could we do to make the proposed regulations \neasier to understand?\n    To send any comments that concern how the Department could make \nthese proposed regulations easier to understand, see the instructions \nin the ADDRESSES section.\n    Intergovernmental Review: This action is subject to Executive Order \n12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. One of the objectives of \nthe Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a \nstrengthened federalism. The Executive order relies on processes \ndeveloped by State and local governments for coordination and review of \nproposed Federal financial assistance.\n    This document provides early notification of our specific plans and \nactions for this program.\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act Certification\n\n    This section considers the effects that the final regulations may \nhave on small entities in the educational sector as required by the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. The purpose of \nthe RFA is to establish as a principle of regulation that agencies \nshould tailor regulatory and informational requirements to the size of \nentities, consistent with the objectives of a particular regulation and \napplicable statutes. The RFA generally requires an agency to prepare a \nregulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and \ncomment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act \nor any other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule will not \nhave a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small \nentities.'' The Secretary certifies that this proposed regulatory \naction would not have a substantial economic impact on a substantial \nnumber of small entities.\n    The U.S. Small Business Administration Size Standards define \nproprietary institutions as small businesses if they are independently \nowned and operated, are not dominant in their field of operation, and \nhave total annual revenue below $7,000,000. Nonprofit institutions are \ndefined as small entities if they are independently owned and operated \nand not dominant in their field of operation. Public\n\n[[Page 21715]]\n\ninstitutions are defined as small organizations if they are operated by \na government overseeing a population below 50,000.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\n    The proposed priorities and definitions do not contain information \ncollection requirements or affect the currently approved data \ncollection.\n    Accessible Format: On request to the program contact person listed \nunder FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT, individuals with disabilities \ncan obtain this document in an accessible format. The Department will \nprovide the requestor with an accessible format that may include Rich \nText Format (RTF) or text format (txt), a thumb drive, an MP3 file, \nbraille, large print, audiotape, compact disc, or another accessible \nformat.\n    Electronic Access to This Document: The official version of this \ndocument is the document published in the Federal Register.

Please see Docket No. FWS-R8-ES-2024-0207 on <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a> for a document that summarizes this proposed rule.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \n\nExecutive Summary\n\n    Why we need to publish a rule. The Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) \ndefines a species as including any subspecies of fish or wildlife or \nplants, and any distinct population segment of any species of \nvertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature. Under the \nAct, a species warrants listing if it\n\n[[Page 21721]]\n\nmeets the definition of an endangered species (in danger of extinction \nthroughout all or a significant portion of its range) or a threatened \nspecies (likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable \nfuture throughout all or a significant portion of its range). If we \ndetermine that a species warrants listing, we must list the species \npromptly. We have determined that the Fish Lake Valley tui chub meets \nthe Act's definition of an endangered species; therefore, we are \nproposing to list it as such. Listing a species as an endangered or \nthreatened species can be completed only by issuing a rule through the \nAdministrative Procedure Act rulemaking process (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.).\n    What this document does. We propose to list the Fish Lake Valley \ntui chub as an endangered species under the Act.\n    The basis for our action. Under the Act, we may determine that a \nspecies is an endangered or threatened species because of any of five \nfactors: (A) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or \ncurtailment of its habitat or range; (B) overutilization for \ncommercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (C) \ndisease or predation; (D) the inadequacy of existing regulatory \nmechanisms; or (E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its \ncontinued existence. We have determined that the Fish Lake Valley tui \nchub meets the Act's definition of an endangered species due to the \nfollowing threats: the destruction and modification of its aquatic \nhabitat caused by agricultural production or other land management \npractices (Factor A), effects of climate change on aquatic habitat \navailability (Factor A), and predation by and competition with invasive \nspecies (Factors C and E).\n\nInformation Requested\n\n    We intend that any final action resulting from this proposed rule \nwill be based on the best scientific and commercial data available and \nbe as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, we request \ncomments or information from other governmental agencies, Native \nAmerican Tribes, the scientific community, industry, or any other \ninterested parties concerning this proposed rule. We particularly seek \ncomments concerning:\n    (1) The Fish Lake Valley tui chub's biology, range, and population \ntrends, including:\n    (a) Biological or ecological requirements of the Fish Lake Valley \ntui chub, including habitat requirements for feeding, breeding, and \nsheltering;\n    (b) Genetics and taxonomy;\n    (c) Historical and current range, including distribution patterns \nand the locations of any additional populations of this fish;\n    (d) Historical and current population levels, and current and \nprojected trends; and\n    (e) Past and ongoing conservation measures for the Fish Lake Valley \ntui chub, its habitat, or both.\n    (2) Threats and conservation actions affecting the Fish Lake Valley \ntui chub, including:\n    (a) Factors that may be affecting the continued existence of the \nFish Lake Valley tui chub, which may include habitat modification or \ndestruction, overutilization, disease, predation, the inadequacy of \nexisting regulatory mechanisms, or other natural or manmade factors;\n    (b) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning \nany threats (or lack thereof) to the Fish Lake Valley tui chub; and\n    (c) Existing regulations or conservation actions that may be \naddressing threats to the Fish Lake Valley tui chub.\n    (3) Additional information concerning the historical and current \nstatus of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub.\n    Please include any supplemental information with your submission \n(such as scientific journal articles or other publications) to allow us \nto verify any scientific or commercial information you include.\n    Please note that submissions merely stating support for, or \nopposition to, the action under consideration without providing \nsupporting information, although noted, do not provide substantial \ninformation necessary to support a determination. Section 4(b)(1)(A) of \nthe Act directs that determinations as to whether any species is an \nendangered or a threatened species must be made solely on the basis of \nthe best scientific and commercial data available.\n    You may submit your comments and materials concerning this proposed \nrule by one of the methods listed in ADDRESSES. We request that you \nsend comments only by the methods described in ADDRESSES.\n    If you submit information via <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>, your \nentire submission--including any personal identifying information--will \nbe posted on the website. If your submission is made via a hardcopy \nthat includes personal identifying information, you may request at the \ntop of your document that we withhold this information from public \nreview. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so. We \nwill post all hardcopy submissions on <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.\n    Comments and materials we receive, as well as supporting \ndocumentation we used in preparing this proposed rule, will be \navailable for public inspection on <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.\n    Our final determination may differ from this proposal because we \nwill consider all comments we receive during the comment period as well \nas any information that may become available after this proposal. Based \non the new information we receive (and, if relevant, any comments on \nthat new information), we may conclude that the Fish Lake Valley tui \nchub is threatened instead of endangered, or we may conclude that the \nFish Lake Valley tui chub does not warrant listing as either an \nendangered species or a threatened species. In our final rule, we will \nclearly explain our rationale and the basis for our final decision, \nincluding why we made changes, if any, that differ from this proposal.\n\nPublic Hearing\n\n    Section 4(b)(5) of the Act provides for a public hearing on this \nproposal, if requested. Requests must be received by the date specified \nin DATES. Such requests must be sent to the address shown in FOR \nFURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. We will schedule a public hearing on this \nproposal, if requested, and announce the date, time, and place of the \nhearing, as well as how to obtain reasonable accommodations, in the \nFederal Register and local newspapers at least 15 days before the \nhearing. We may hold the public hearing in person or virtually via \nwebinar. We will announce any public hearing on our website, in \naddition to the Federal Register. The use of virtual public hearings is \nconsistent with our regulations at 50 CFR 424.16(c)(3).\n\nPrevious Federal Actions\n\n    On March 23, 2021, we received a petition, dated March 9, 2021, \nfrom the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) requesting that the Fish \nLake Valley tui chub (Siphateles bicolor ssp. 4) be listed as an \nendangered or threatened species and critical habitat be designated \nunder the Act. On August 23, 2022, we published a 90-day finding that \nthe petition presented substantial scientific or commercial information \nindicating the petitioned action may be warranted (87 FR 51635). While \nthe 2021 petition requested that the Service list the Fish Lake Valley \ntui chub as the taxonomic entity known as S. bicolor ssp. 4, our review \nof recent genetic analyses led to placing the Fish Lake Valley tui chub\n\n[[Page 21722]]\n\nwithin S. obesus ssp. instead (Campbell et al. 2024, p. 8).\n\nPeer Review\n\n    A species status assessment (SSA) team prepared an SSA report for \nthe Fish Lake Valley tui chub. The SSA team was composed of Service \nbiologists, in consultation with other species experts. The SSA report \nrepresents a compilation of the best scientific and commercial data \navailable concerning the status of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub, \nincluding the impacts of past, present, and future factors (both \nnegative and beneficial) affecting the Fish Lake Valley tui chub.\n    In accordance with our joint policy on peer review published in the \nFederal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34270), and our August 22, \n2016, memorandum updating and clarifying the role of peer review in \nlisting and recovery actions under the Act (<a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/peer-review-policy-directors-memo-2016-08-22.pdf\">https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/peer-review-policy-directors-memo-2016-08-22.pdf</a>), we solicited independent scientific review of the information \ncontained in the Fish Lake Valley tui chub SSA report. We sent the SSA \nreport to four independent peer reviewers and received two responses. \nThe peer reviews can be found at <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a> at Docket \nNo. FWS-R8-ES-2024-0207. In preparing this proposed rule, we \nincorporated the results of these reviews, as appropriate, into the SSA \nreport, which is the foundation for this proposed rule.\n\nSummary of Peer Reviewer Comments\n\n    As discussed above in Peer Review, we received comments from two \npeer reviewers on the draft SSA report. We reviewed all comments we \nreceived from the peer reviewers for substantive issues and new \ninformation regarding the contents of the SSA report. The peer \nreviewers generally provided additional references, clarifications, and \nwording suggestions. We revised the updated SSA report based on the \npeer reviewers' comments, including adjusting our projections for the \nfuture scenarios, clarifying specific points where appropriate, and \nadding details and suggested references where needed. Peer reviewer \ncomments are addressed in the following summary and were incorporated \ninto the current SSA report (Service 2024, entire) as appropriate.\n    Comment 1: One peer reviewer recommended that we add specific \nquantitative data to describe the Fish Lake Valley tui chub's needs \ninstead of using qualitative terms such as ``adequate water quality'' \nand ``adequate population size.'' The reviewer suggested using values \nobtained from the literature on similar subspecies or using the \nmeasurements taken at one of the extant sites as a baseline.\n    Our response: We revised the description of the Fish Lake Valley \ntui chub's needs to include more quantitative values where data were \navailable for similar subspecies such as the Lahontan tui chub, Mohave \ntui chub, and Owens tui chub. To describe the ecological resources that \neach Fish Lake Valley tui chub life stage (egg, larva, juvenile, and \nadult) needs to breed, feed, and shelter, quantitative ranges were \nprovided for suitable water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and \nalkalinity.\n    Comment 2: One peer reviewer suggested that we change the \ntemperature range for spawning preferences in the applicable table \nbecause the current conditions at the McNett spring system fall outside \nof that range.\n    Our response: We widened the range in the table to include the \nconditions at the McNett spring system based on similar natural history \ninformation found for other southwestern Great Basin tui chub \nsubspecies.\n    Comment 3: One peer reviewer recommended that we add biological \ninformation from springsnails found in the McNett spring system. \nBecause springsnails are highly sensitive to changes in environmental \nconditions, their presence is an indication that the natural conditions \nat the site have been constant.\n    Our response: We did not apply this change because the consistency \nof the natural, thermal conditions at the McNett spring system is \nexplicitly described in the discussion of the Fish Lake Valley tui \nchub's current condition. The vulnerability of the tui chub's habitat \nis evident through the historical drying of habitat and the Fish Lake \nValley tui chub's extirpation from five sites in Fish Lake Valley.\n    Comment 4: One peer reviewer suggested we revise the future \nconditions analysis to show that extirpation of both extant populations \n(i.e., extinction of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub) is possible given \nthat both populations are imminently at risk of catastrophic collapse.\n    Our response: We added clarifying language, such as ``high risk of \nextirpation,'' to the overall assessment to clarify the Fish Lake \nValley tui chub's future condition. We modified the lower plausible \nfuture scenario to include the risk of extinction. For decisions \nrelated to species classification under the Act, we use scenarios that \ninclude only plausible future influences, not everything that is \ntheoretically possible.\n    Plausible events are those that seem reasonable, have an appearance \nof truth or reason, and are credible or believable from the perspective \nof a rational impartial observer (O'Hagan 2019, entire). In an SSA, \nplausibility would be supported by literature regarding past trends or \nprojections of influences, expert judgment, or other citable evidence \nand would be relevant, informative, and appropriate within the \ndecision's context. Alternatively, possible refers to a proposition or \nevent that is conceivable and is beyond what a rational impartial \nobserver would consider credible, believable, or reasonable. Therefore, \nthe possible includes lower probability events than the plausible. \nFuture influences that are possible, but not plausible, are not \nincluded in the SSA status scenario analysis.\n\nI. Proposed Listing Determination\n\nBackground\n\n    A thorough review of the taxonomy, life history, and ecology of the \nFish Lake Valley tui chub (Siphateles obesus ssp.) is presented in the \nSSA report (version 1.0; Service 2024, pp. 14-18).\n    The Fish Lake Valley tui chub is a small minnow native to the Fish \nLake Valley basin, which spans the Nevada/California border. The tui \nchubs in Fish Lake Valley have all been found in Esmeralda County, \nNevada, and are geographically isolated from other forms of tui chub. \nThe Fish Lake Valley tui chub is considered a valid subspecies (Hubbs & \nMiller 1948, p. 44; 87 FR 51635, August 23, 2022; Campbell et al. 2024, \np. 8). While the 2021 petition requested that the Service list the Fish \nLake Valley tui chub as the taxonomic entity known as S. bicolor ssp. \n4, recent genetic analyses have placed the Fish Lake Valley tui chub \nwithin S. obesus instead (Campbell et al. 2024, p. 8). Therefore, we \nrefer to the Fish Lake Valley tui chub as S. obesus ssp. in this \ndocument and the SSA report (Service 2024, entire). This taxonomic \nchange does not change our understanding of the subspecies' \ndistribution or status.\n    Tui chubs are small minnows with 41 to 64 scales along the decurved \nlateral line (Moyle 2002, p. 122). Tui chubs have 8 to 24 gill rakers \nand rounded, short fins (Moyle 2002, p. 122). Coloration varies from \nsilvery to dusky olive, brown, or brassy (Moyle 2002, p. 122). Length \nof tui chubs is variable, although adults in springs may only reach 4 \nto 5 inches (10 to 12 centimeters) (Moyle 2002, p. 122). Fish Lake \nValley tui chubs from the\n\n[[Page 21723]]\n\nhistorical population at Fish Lake were measured at up to 8 inches (20 \ncentimeters) (Hubbs 1934, unpaginated).\n    The Fish Lake Valley tui chub is a narrow endemic subspecies known \nfrom six historical sites within Fish Lake Valley (see figure 1 under \nCurrent Condition, below). Historical records of this tui chub are from \nlakes and small springs, including Fish Lake, Sand Spring, McNett \nspring system, Pothole Springs, an unnamed spring, and several valley \nchannels flowing into Fish Lake (Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW) \n1991, entire; Sada n.d., unpaginated). The Fish Lake Valley tui chub is \ncurrently extant in the McNett spring system, the only currently \noccupied site within the historical range. A second population has been \nintroduced into Lida Pond outside of the subspecies' historical range.\n    The primary life stages for the Fish Lake Valley tui chub are egg, \nlarva, juvenile, and adult. Few specifics are known about the life \nhistory of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub, and much of what we know \nregarding the subspecies' life history comes from studies of other tui \nchub subspecies. Females lay 6,100-68,900 eggs in gravel substrate or \naquatic vegetation, and males fertilize them when water temperatures \nreach 55-72 degrees Fahrenheit ([deg]F) (13-22 degrees Celsius \n([deg]C)). In warmer springs and ponds, this can be late February \nthrough August, but it primarily happens between April and July (Sigler \nand Sigler 1987, p. 169; Moyle 2002, p. 125; Vicker 1973, p. 11). Eggs \nhatch in 3 to 6 days (Moyle 2002, p. 125). After the eggs hatch, the \nfish are considered to be in the larval stage; this stage generally \noccurs between February and August, depending on the environmental \nconditions and timing of spawning. Occasionally male tui chubs sexually \nmature after 1 year, but most mature at 2 years, with females maturing \nbetween 2 and 3 years of age (Sigler and Sigler 1987, p. 169). In the \nspring when water temperatures warm, spawning occurs again, restarting \nthe life cycle for the next generation of tui chubs. Tui chubs can live \nup to 35 years in large lakes, but in smaller ponds and springs, their \nobserved maximum lifespan is 7 years (Moyle 2002, p. 125; Crain and \nCorcoran 2000, p. 149).\n\nRegulatory and Analytical Framework\n\nRegulatory Framework\n\n    Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and the implementing \nregulations in title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations set forth \nthe procedures for determining whether a species is an endangered \nspecies or a threatened species, issuing protective regulations for \nthreatened species, and designating critical habitat for endangered and \nthreatened species.\n    The Act defines an ``endangered species'' as a species that is in \ndanger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its \nrange and a ``threatened species'' as a species that is likely to \nbecome an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout \nall or a significant portion of its range. The Act requires that we \ndetermine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened \nspecies because of any of the following factors:\n    (A) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or \ncurtailment of its habitat or range;\n    (B) Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or \neducational purposes;\n    (C) Disease or predation;\n    (D) The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or\n    (E) Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued \nexistence.\n    These factors represent broad categories of natural or human-caused \nactions or conditions that could have an effect on a species' continued \nexistence. In evaluating these actions and conditions, we look for \nthose that may have a negative effect on individuals of the species, as \nwell as other actions or conditions that may ameliorate any negative \neffects or may have positive effects.\n    We use the term ``threat'' to refer in general to actions or \nconditions that are known to or are reasonably likely to negatively \naffect individuals of a species. The term ``threat'' includes actions \nor conditions that have a direct impact on individuals (direct \nimpacts), as well as those that affect individuals through alteration \nof their habitat or required resources (stressors). The term ``threat'' \nmay encompass--either together or separately--the source of the action \nor condition or the action or condition itself.\n    However, the mere identification of any threat(s) does not \nnecessarily mean that the species meets the statutory definition of an \n``endangered species'' or a ``threatened species.'' In determining \nwhether a species meets either definition, we must evaluate all \nidentified threats by considering the species' expected response and \nthe effects of the threats--in light of those actions and conditions \nthat will ameliorate the threats--on an individual, population, and \nspecies level. We evaluate each threat and its expected effects on the \nspecies, then analyze the cumulative effect of all of the threats on \nthe species as a whole. We also consider the cumulative effect of the \nthreats in light of those actions and conditions that will have \npositive effects on the species, such as any existing regulatory \nmechanisms or conservation efforts. The Secretary determines whether \nthe species meets the definition of an ``endangered species'' or a \n``threatened species'' only after conducting this cumulative analysis \nand describing the expected effect on the species.\n    The Act does not define the term ``foreseeable future,'' which \nappears in the statutory definition of ``threatened species.'' Our \nimplementing regulations at 50 CFR 424.11(d) set forth a framework for \nevaluating the foreseeable future on a case-by-case basis which is \nfurther described in the 2009 Memorandum Opinion on the foreseeable \nfuture from the Department of the Interior, Office of the Solicitor (M-\n37021, January 16, 2009; ``M-Opinion,'' available online at <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.opengov.ibmcloud.com/files/uploads/M-37021.pdf\">https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.opengov.ibmcloud.com/files/uploads/M-37021.pdf</a>). \nThe foreseeable future extends as far into the future as the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service (hereafter, \nthe Services) can make reasonably reliable predictions about the \nthreats to the species and the species' responses to those threats. We \nneed not identify the foreseeable future in terms of a specific period \nof time. We will describe the foreseeable future on a case-by-case \nbasis, using the best scientific and commercial data available and \ntaking into account considerations such as the species' life-history \ncharacteristics, threat projection timeframes, and environmental \nvariability. In other words, the foreseeable future is the period of \ntime over which we can make reasonably reliable predictions. \n``Reliable'' does not mean ``certain''; it means sufficient to provide \na reasonable degree of confidence in the prediction, in light of the \nconservation purposes of the Act.\n\nAnalytical Framework\n\n    The SSA report documents the results of our comprehensive \nbiological review of the best scientific and commercial data available \nregarding the status of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub, including an \nassessment of the potential threats to this subspecies. The SSA report \ndoes not represent our decision on whether the subspecies should be \nproposed for listing as an endangered or threatened species under the \nAct. However, it does provide the scientific basis that informs our \nregulatory decisions, which involve the further application of \nstandards\n\n[[Page 21724]]\n\nwithin the Act and its implementing regulations and policies.\n    To assess the Fish Lake Valley tui chub's viability, we used the \nthree conservation biology principles of resiliency, redundancy, and \nrepresentation (Shaffer and Stein 2000, pp. 306-310). Briefly, \nresiliency is the ability of the species to withstand environmental and \ndemographic stochasticity (for example, wet or dry, warm or cold \nyears); redundancy is the ability of the species to withstand \ncatastrophic events (for example, droughts, large pollution events); \nand representation is the ability of the species to adapt to both near-\nterm and long-term changes in its physical and biological environment \n(for example, climate conditions, pathogens). In general, species \nviability will increase with increases in resiliency, redundancy, and \nrepresentation (Smith et al. 2018, p. 306). Using these principles, we \nidentified the Fish Lake Valley tui chub's ecological requirements for \nsurvival and reproduction at the individual, population, and subspecies \nlevels, and described the beneficial and risk factors influencing the \nsubspecies' viability.\n    The SSA process can be categorized into three sequential stages. \nDuring the first stage, we evaluated the individual subspecies' life-\nhistory needs. The next stage involved an assessment of the historical \nand current condition of the subspecies' demographics and habitat \ncharacteristics, including an explanation of how the subspecies arrived \nat its current condition. The final stage of the SSA involved making \npredictions about the subspecies' future condition, including responses \nto positive and negative environmental and anthropogenic influences. \nThroughout all of these stages, we used the best scientific and \ncommercial data available to characterize viability as the ability of \nthe Fish Lake Valley tui chub to sustain populations in the wild over \ntime, which we then used to inform our regulatory decision.\n    The following is a summary of the key results and conclusions from \nthe SSA report; the full SSA report can be found at Docket No. FWS-R8-\nES-2024-0207 on <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a>.\n\nSummary of Biological Status and Threats\n\n    In this discussion, we review the biological condition of the \nsubspecies and its resources, and the threats that influence the \nsubspecies' current and future condition, in order to assess the \nsubspecies' overall viability and the risks to that viability.\n\nSubspecies Needs\n\n    To begin this assessment, we focus on the first conservation \nbiology principle of resiliency. For Fish Lake Valley tui chub \npopulations to have sufficient resiliency, the needs of individuals \nmust be met at a large enough scale to address population-level and \nsubspecies-level needs. The Fish Lake Valley tui chub needs sufficient \n(1) habitat quantity, (2) habitat quality, (3) population growth, and \n(4) population size to support sustainable populations in a highly \nvariable and unpredictable environment. The individual needs of Fish \nLake Valley tui chub are primarily a function of habitat condition and \nare summarized below in table 1. All Fish Lake Valley tui chub life \nstages require permanent water bodies with adequate water quality, and \nthey feed on invertebrates and algae. Successful reproduction is \ndependent on suitable substrates of gravel or aquatic vegetation. Much \nof the data presented in table 1 is derived from studies of tui chub in \ngeneral because there are few specific ecological resource needs data \navailable specifically for the Fish Lake Valley tui chub. Therefore, \nwhere we do provide a range of values, the values were determined by \nstudies conducted on similar subspecies; otherwise, the term \n``adequate'' was used for resource needs that are uncertain.\n\n          Table 1--Fish Lake Valley Tui Chub's Individual Needs\n                          [Service 2024, p. 19]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                Function and description of the resource\n             Need                                 need\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWater temperatures suitable    Eggs are laid when water temperatures\n for reproduction.              reach 55-72 [deg]F (13-22 [deg]C),\n                                primarily between April and July.

Eggs hatch in 3\n                                to 6 days, usually at temperatures\n                                between 66-68 [deg]F (19-20 [deg]C).\nAdequate year-round water      Adequate year-round water quality (pH of\n quality and flow.              7.6-9.6 and dissolved solids <900\n                                milligrams per liter (mg/L)) and flow\n                                are critical for survival of all life\n                                stages. Eggs require adequate dissolved\n                                oxygen (>4.5 mg/L). Water must be low\n                                velocity and must have sufficient\n                                quantity (at least about 1 meter deep\n                                year-round) and limited sedimentation.\nGravel or aquatic vegetation   Eggs are laid in gravel substrate or\n substrates.                    aquatic vegetation.

For the Fish Lake Valley tui chub, the abundance of \nindividuals depends upon adequate surface water habitat. Having \nmultiple populations increases the subspecies' redundancy and helps \nmitigate impacts from localized threats. The Fish Lake Valley tui chub \nneeds a sufficient quantity and quality of habitat to sustain \npopulations. The subspecies has historically inhabited a small area, \nmaking the amount of suitable habitat important for the resiliency of \nthe subspecies. Quality of habitat depends upon the presence of \nsuitable water temperature and chemical parameters (e.g., dissolved \noxygen, pH), adequate food resources, and suitable spawning habitat, as \nwell as the absence of nonnative and invasive species.\n    For the Fish Lake Valley tui chub to have high viability, the \nsubspecies needs to maintain its representation (adaptive capacity) by \nhaving multiple, highly resilient populations (redundancy) to withstand \ncatastrophic events. As a narrow endemic, the Fish Lake Valley tui chub \ninherently has low redundancy. However, it is still important to have \nmultiple, highly resilient populations to help mitigate impacts from \nthreats and stochastic\n\n[[Page 21725]]\n\nevents. Having multiple populations also helps maintain genetic \ndiversity and adaptive capacity.\n\nThreats\n\n    We identified agricultural production, lithium mining, geothermal \ndevelopment, changes in habitat management, climate change, and \ninvasive species as the primary threats currently affecting the Fish \nLake Valley tui chub. The following discussion provides a summary of \nthe threats and stressors that are affecting or may be affecting the \ncurrent and future condition of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub \nthroughout some or all of its range. A more detailed description may be \nfound in the SSA report (Service 2024, pp. 25-36).\nAgricultural Production\n    Agriculture has been a historically important component of the \neconomy of Fish Lake Valley and continues to this day (Suverly 2001, \nunpaginated). The principal crop is alfalfa, comprising 58 percent of \nthe total agricultural sales in Esmeralda County, with other hay \nproducts constituting another 2 percent (Suverly 2001, unpaginated). \nAlfalfa is a water-intensive crop, requiring 4.2 feet (1.3 meters) of \nwater per year to be grown in the Fish Lake Valley (Huntington and \nAllen 2010, p. 252). Between 2008 and 2023, alfalfa crop cover in the \nFish Lake Valley hydrologic basin increased nearly 250 percent from \n4,509 acres (1,825 hectares) to 11,142 acres (4,509 hectares) (U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture n.d., unpaginated).\n    Primarily due to groundwater pumping for agricultural use, \ngroundwater levels in Fish Lake Valley have declined up to 2.0 feet \n(0.6 meter) per year resulting in over 75 feet (23 meters) of drawdown \n(Esmeralda County 2022, pp. 45, 51) from the late 1960s to about 2010 \n(Esmeralda County 2022, p. 51), which has significantly reduced Fish \nLake Valley tui chub habitat throughout the subspecies' range (NDOW \n1991, p. 1; Nevada Division of Natural Heritage (NDNH) 2020, \nunpaginated; Pedretti et al. 1985b, p. 7; Sada n.d., unpaginated). \nGroundwater has been pumped for decades for agricultural purposes on \nboth sides of the Nevada/California border within the Fish Lake Valley \nhydrographic basin. Permitted allocations exceed available water \nresources, and actual groundwater withdrawals must be reduced within \nNevada and California until groundwater withdrawals are sustainable \n(Esmeralda County 2022, p. 49). In 2023, the Nevada State Engineer's \nOffice assessed the Fish Lake Valley groundwater basin to be \noverappropriated by 150 to 250 percent of the perennial yield (Nevada \nDivision of Water Resources 2023, p. 7). Ninety-nine percent of the \ngroundwater resources pumped in Fish Lake Valley are devoted to \nirrigation of agricultural crops (Nevada Division of Water Resources \n2019, p. 8). As agricultural production has increased in both the \nNevada and California portions of Fish Lake Valley in recent decades, \nthe groundwater level in the Fish Lake Valley basin has continued to \ndecline from groundwater pumping that exceeds annual recharge \n(Department of Agriculture n.d. unpaginated; Nevada Division of Water \nResources 2023, pp. 7-8; Esmeralda County 2022, pp. 49-50). This \noverdraft is causing the collapse of the aquifer and damaging the \nability of the aquifer to store water in the future (Esmeralda County \n2022, p. 49).\n    The drawdown of groundwater has direct negative effects on the \nhabitat of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub. Surveyors routinely reported \n(1985, 1989, 1991, 1995, 2001, 2023) desiccation of known tui chub \nhabitats in the central Fish Lake Valley in the late 20th century (NDOW \n1991, p. 1; NDNH 2020, unpaginated; Pedretti 1985b, p. 7; Sada n.d., \nunpaginated; NDOW 2023, pp. 3-6). Fish Lake, the body of water for \nwhich the valley is named and that was historically occupied by the \nFish Lake Valley tui chub, was affected by human modification of the \nspringhead and reduced flows (NDOW 1991, p. 1). By 1995, a site visit \nrevealed no fish were present as the lake had become too dry (NDNH \n2020, unpaginated). Although the lakebed still holds ephemeral water \nfollowing heavy rains or periods of snowmelt, groundwater levels \ndropped too low to provide consistent surface water coverage, and, as a \nresult, the tui chubs at Fish Lake were extirpated. Other nearby \nsprings formerly supporting tui chubs have also been affected by \ngroundwater drawdown, with the Pothole Springs and the unnamed springs \ndrying up between the mid-1980s and early 2000s (Pedretti et al. 1985b, \np. 7; NDOW 1991, p.1; Sada n.d. unpaginated).\nLithium Mining\n    The only currently active large-scale lithium mine in the United \nStates is operating at Silver Peak in Clayton Valley, Nevada, \napproximately 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Fish Lake Valley. The \nClayton Valley groundwater basin has been permanently losing storage \ndue to groundwater withdrawals for evaporative mineral concentration, \nthe process that has commonly been used for lithium extraction in this \narea (Esmeralda County 2012, p. 43; Pennington 2021, p. 2). Lithium \nmining operations have caused water levels in Clayton Valley to \ndecline, with some wells drying completely (Pennington 2021, p. 2). \nAdditional lithium claims have been proposed in Fish Lake Valley, \nClayton Valley, and Columbus Salt Marsh (approximately 20 miles (30 \nkilometers) north of Fish Lake Valley), indicating that lithium mining \noperations are likely to expand in this area in the future.\n    Lithium claystone mining was recently permitted to proceed at \nRhyolite Ridge, approximately 8 miles (13 kilometers) east of the Fish \nLake Valley tui chub site at the McNett spring system (Ioneer 2024, pp. \n1-72; Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 2024, entire). Claystone mining \nis an alternative method of extracting lithium through the excavation \nof ore and processing the ore with acid to leach out the lithium \n(Ioneer 2024, pp. 1-72). Lithium claystone mining is considered to be \nless water intensive than the traditional evaporative lithium brine \nextraction methods (Ioneer 2024, p. i). However, water is still \nnecessary for production of the acid used in the processing facility, \nfor construction of infrastructure, and for dust suppression (Ioneer \n2024 pp. 1-72). The Rhyolite Ridge mine proposes to use approximately \n4,032 acre-feet (over 4 million cubic meters) of water annually (Ioneer \n2024, p. 33). Water necessary for mining operations could include \npumping groundwater from Fish Lake Valley to the Rhyolite Ridge mine \nsite (Ioneer 2024, p. 33). In 2023, mining companies began exploratory \ndrilling for lithium resources at the Fish Lake Valley playa, 7 miles \n(11 kilometers) northeast of the McNett spring system, and seismic \nsurveys have been conducted for lithium resources 2 miles (3 \nkilometers) east of the McNett spring system (Morella Corporation 2024, \np. 8).\n    Lithium mining in the Fish Lake Valley area is likely to impact \ngroundwater resources in Fish Lake Valley regardless of the type of \nmines developed in the area, as both lithium brine and claystone mining \nrequire substantial groundwater use (Pennington 2021, p. 2; Ioneer \n2024, p. 33). In conjunction with continuing agricultural uses and \npotential geothermal development discussed below, water use for lithium \nmining will likely exacerbate the already overallocated Fish Lake \nValley groundwater basin that supplies water for tui chub habitat in \nthe McNett spring system.\n\n[[Page 21726]]\n\nGeothermal Development\n    Geothermal energy production has not yet occurred in Fish Lake \nValley. However, there has been interest in geothermal development, \nwith multiple active geothermal leases with exploratory wells being \ndrilled in the valley near the tui chub population in the McNett spring \nsystem (BLM 2022a, p. 9). The Fish Lake Geothermal Project area is \nlocated 0.3 miles (0.5 kilometer) northwest of the McNett spring \nsystem, and the project is currently in the early permitting phase, \nwith energy production possible within the next several years (BLM \n2023, p. 9). The Lone Mountain Geothermal project area is located 4.1 \nmiles (6.6 kilometers) northeast of the McNett spring system and is \nalso in the early exploration and permitting phase (BLM 2022a, p. 9).\n    Prior to geothermal development of a particular area, the flow path \nof water beneath the land surface is usually not known with sufficient \ndetail to understand and prevent surface impacts that may be caused by \nsuch development (Sorey 2000, p. 705). However, changes associated with \nsurface expression of thermal waters from geothermal production have \nbeen commonly observed, including, but not limited to, changes in water \ntemperature, flow, and water quality (Bonte et al. 2011, pp. 4-8; Chen \net al. 2020, pp. 2-6; Kaya et al. 2011, pp. 55-64; Sorey 2000, entire), \nwhich could all be direct changes to the necessary parameters of the \nhabitat needs of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub. Conversely, there have \nalso been geothermal production plants that did not result in any \nmeasurable effects to surface water characteristics (Kaya et al. 2011, \npp. 55-64; Sorey 2000, p. 706).\n    In an effort to minimize these changes in water temperature, \nquantity, and quality, and to maintain pressure of the geothermal \nreservoir, geothermal fluids may be reinjected into the ground to \nreheat the used fluids and maintain local geothermal reservoir pressure \n(U.S. Department of Energy n.d., entire). This practice entails much \ntrial and error in an attempt to equilibrate subsurface reservoir \npressure, and it can take several years to understand how a new \ngeothermal field will react to production and reinjection wells (Kaya \net al. 2011, pp. 55-64).\n    The aforementioned type of changes in surface-expressed water \ntemperature and flow from geothermal production areas have been \ndocumented in several places in California and Nevada, including the \nLong Valley Caldera roughly 40 miles (64 kilometers) southwest of Fish \nLake Valley (Sorey 2000, entire). For example, the geothermal water \ncomponent in springs at Hot Creek Fish Hatchery has been reduced by 30 \nto 40 percent since 1990 (Sorey 2000, p. 706). Geothermal pumping \nbetween 1985 and 1998 at Casa Diablo Geothermal Plant, part of Ormat \nTechnologies, Inc., Mammoth Geothermal Complex, resulted in flow \nceasing at Colton Spring (1.2 miles (1.9 kilometers) east of Casa \nDiablo) and declines in water level at Hot Bubbling Pool (3.1 miles (5 \nkilometers) east of Casa Diablo) (Sorey 2000, p. 706). Similarly, a \nlarge geothermal power plant in Jersey Valley, Nevada, located \napproximately 170 miles (274 kilometers) north of Fish Lake Valley, \ncaused the cessation of a thermal spring flow just 3 years after \nproduction began (BLM 2022b, p. 1).\n    It is also possible that geothermal energy production may have no \ndiscernible effect to the local spring systems as has been observed for \nsome projects. For example, at the Casa Diablo Geothermal plant, the \nproject-related decline in thermal component did not result in the \nlowering of temperature of the thermally influenced Hatchery Springs \n(2.5 miles (4 kilometers) east of Casa Diablo), probably due to the \nmoderating influence of rock conductivity (Sorey 2000, p. 706). \nAdditionally, the Casa Diablo plant did not produce any change in \nthermal water discharge of the Hot Creek Gorge, located 3 miles (4.8 \nkilometers) from the well field, from the period 1988-1998 (Sorey 2000, \np. 706).\n    Preliminary geothermal well pumping tests for the Fish Lake \nGeothermal Project failed to detect a measurable response in water \nlevels or spring flows within the McNett spring system (UES Consulting \nServices, Inc. 2024a, p. 16), although a numerical groundwater model \npredicted minimal project-related drawdown (UES Consulting Services, \nInc. 2024b, p. 65). This may be due to the limitation of short-term \n(approximately 2 months) monitoring or the confounding effects of \nprecipitation events during the testing period (UES Consulting \nServices, Inc. 2024a, p. 16). It may also be that the geothermal \nconnection at McNett spring system is so diffuse that spring flows are \nnot sensitive to pumping from the geothermal resource (UES Consulting \nServices, Inc. 2024b, p. 15).\n    The highly varied effects of geothermal energy production on \nthermal waters are likely going to depend on many factors including the \nunique hydrogeology of the project site and methodology used. Springs \nwithin the same proximate geographic area or wetland system may respond \ndifferently to the geothermal plant, for example, depending on the \nrelative contribution of geothermal fluids to the spring discharge. The \nhydraulic connection between geothermal reservoirs and shallow \ngroundwater basins cannot be inferred based on distance alone but is \nrather determined by multiple and synergistic factors such as the \npresence of faults or fractures, the transmissivity of the underlying \nmaterial, and other local surface water and/or groundwater extraction.\n    Despite the variation in potential impacts from geothermal projects \non nearby spring systems, for the McNett spring system, the best \navailable information suggests that nearby geothermal development will \nutilize the source of discharge at the spring. We infer this based on \nthe recorded temperatures and geochemical analyses of the McNett spring \nsystem, which indicate that there is some level of geothermal input. \nDuring the winter months, water temperatures at the McNett spring \nsystem routinely register above the ambient air temperature. For \nexample, in late March of 2021, the water temperature at the main pool \nwas measured as 67 [deg]F (19.3 [deg]C) and the water temperature at an \noutflow well was 71 [deg]F (21.68 [deg]C) (NDOW 2021, p. 4). The \nambient air temperature that day registered 56 [deg]F (13.6 [deg]C) \n(NDOW 2021, p. 7). Additionally, recent geochemical analysis of fluids \nfrom the McNett spring system suggests that the waters are between 7 to \n11 percent geothermal in source (UES Consulting Services, Inc. 2024b, \np. 144). This is an indication that the habitat within the McNett \nspring system is partially sustained by the geothermal reservoir.\n    Even if the springs are only partially supplied by the geothermal \nreservoir, changes in the pressure or flow paths of groundwater due to \nnearby geothermal production and injection wells may alter discharge, \nwater temperature, and water quality of surface springs at the McNett \nspring system, as has been seen elsewhere in Nevada. While short-term \nflow tests did not detect a response to the spring flows at McNett for \nthe Fish Lake Geothermal Project, longer term pumping associated with \nthe future plant may produce an effect on water quality or spring \nflows. The combined geothermal pumping associated with two nearby \ngeothermal plants (Fish Lake Geothermal and Lone Mountain) may increase \nthe risk of habitat desiccation or deterioration over time such that \nthe McNett Spring system may no longer support the Fish Lake Valley tui \nchub; however, there is significant uncertainty that geothermal \ndevelopment will\n\n[[Page 21727]]\n\nbecome a threat to the viability of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub.\nChanges in Habitat Management\n    Historical and recent oversight and management practices at the \nMcNett spring system have resulted in suitable conditions for the Fish \nLake Valley tui chub at this one remaining historical site, evidenced \nby the persistence of a population maintaining around 2,000 individuals \nfor approximately 20 years (NDOW 2002, p. 1; NDOW 2005, p. 1; NDOW \n2021, p. 6). Most of the McNett spring system is privately owned and \nused for cattle grazing (Red Spring Allotment, under grazing permit \nNV00091). Cooperation between the landowner and NDOW has ensured \naccurate estimates of the tui chub's current population and the \ngathering of additional information about the life history of the fish.\n    Current levels of grazing may have contributed to the current \navailability of open water at the McNett spring system by preventing \nencroachment of aquatic vegetation (NDOW 2022, pp. 2-3). In contrast, \nLida Pond, which is located on BLM land and falls within the Magruder \nMountain Allotment (permit number NV00099), had recently been \noverutilized by trespass cattle, causing bank erosion and reduction of \nopen water habitat, before the BLM became aware of and excluded the \ntrespass cattle (Strother 2024, pers. comm.). An increase in grazing \npressure may result in sedimentation and reduced water quality due to \nheavy livestock use, while a complete absence of grazing may cause an \novergrowth of marshy vegetation at the expense of open water habitat \nused by the Fish Lake Valley tui chub.\n    Since the early 1990s, the springhead at McNett has been modified \nwith dams and water control structures (NDOW 1991, p. 1). To date, \nthese structures have likely improved Fish Lake Valley tui chub habitat \nat the site by deepening the main pool where the majority of the tui \nchubs live, although future property management may not have the same \nbeneficial effects. In the past, and as recently as 1993, surveys by \nNDOW noted goldfish (Carassius auratus) in the McNett spring system \n(NDOW 1993, p. 1). In the early 20th century, other nonnative fish, \nincluding black bass (Micropterus spp.) and common carp (Cyprinus \ncarpio), were also documented from the site (Hubbs 1934, unpaginated). \nThe most recent NDOW survey data from 2021 did not indicate the \npresence of nonnative fish in the spring system (NDOW 2021, entire). A \ndeeper pool may encourage property managers or trespassers to introduce \nsportfish or aquarium fish for recreational or aesthetic purposes. The \nrisk of the public introducing nonnative fish may also increase if \npublic access to the McNett spring system is allowed in the future (see \n``Invasive Species,'' below).\n    Because there are currently no formal agreements in place \nprotecting the McNett spring system, uncertainty exists regarding the \nmaintenance of habitat conditions conducive for the future persistence \nof Fish Lake Valley tui chub at this site.\nClimate Change\n    Climate change has already impacted Fish Lake Valley and will \ncontinue to do so at an increasing rate in the future. In general, \nwarmer temperatures and greater extremes in precipitation amounts are \nmodeled for this region of the western United States (Marvel et al. \n2023, pp. 11-20). Current climate change forecasts for the southwestern \nUnited States, including Nevada and California, predict warmer air \ntemperatures, more intense precipitation events (both drought and \nflooding), and increased summer continental drying by the year 2100 \n(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2014, entire; \nGonzalez et al. 2018, pp. 1109-1110; McAfee et al. 2021, entire; \nFrankson et al. 2022, entire; Runkle et al. 2022, entire; Marvel et al. \n2023, pp. 11-20).\n    Average annual temperatures have increased almost 1.9 [deg]F (1.1 \n[deg]C) over the past decade compared to the preindustrial period of \n1850-1899, and an increase of 3.6 to 6.7 [deg]F (2.0 [deg]C to 3.7 \n[deg]C) is predicted to occur by the year 2100 (Garfin et al. 2014, p. \n464; Arias et al. 2021, p. 60; Marvel et al. 2023, pp. 10, 29). Mean \nannual temperature within Fish Lake Valley is projected to increase \nbetween 5.7 and 10.3 [deg]F (3.2 and 5.7 [deg]C) by 2100 compared to \nthe historical average, reflecting a pattern where the contiguous \nUnited States is warming faster than the global average (Marvel et al. \n2023, p. 11). The models are projected under two different emission \nscenarios: a high emissions scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions \ncontinue to increase into the next century (representative \nconcentration pathway (RCP) 8.5) and a low emission scenario in which \ngreenhouse gas emissions stabilize by mid-century and then decline to \nlevels seen in the 1990s by the end of the century (RCP4.5).\n    Increased temperature and more variable precipitation within the \nrange of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub will place additional stress on \ngroundwater resources and aquatic habitat availability. The Fish Lake \nValley tui chub now only occurs in sites that are completely dependent \non spring outflows. Desert springs support relatively small aquatic \nsystems, as surface flows are sustained by groundwater. The springs \nrange widely in size, temperature, water chemistry, morphology, \nlandscape setting, and persistence. Springs occur where subterranean \nwater under pressure reaches the Earth's surface through fault zones, \nrock cracks, or orifices that occur when water creates a passage toward \nthe surface. In general, springs are uniquely influenced by aquifer \ngeology, morphology, discharge rates, and regional precipitation. Most \nvalley aquifers in the Great Basin are recharged by springtime runoff \nduring snowmelt from adjacent mountain ranges. Specifically, the White \nMountains, which form the north and west boundary of Fish Lake Valley, \nprovide the springtime runoff and recharge to the groundwater basin.\n    A spring's size is generally a function of discharge, which can be \naffected by precipitation and evapotranspiration. Also, springs can be \ncharacterized as an endpoint in a continuous spectrum of groundwater \ndischarge processes (van der Kamp 1995, pp. 5-6), or points of focused \ngroundwater discharge from groundwater flow systems. These flow systems \ntransport groundwater from recharge areas to discharge areas under the \ninfluence of gravity. The rate of spring flow averaged over several \nyears equals the average rate of recharge to the flow systems that feed \nthe spring. The annual rate of groundwater recharge is always less than \nthe annual precipitation and can be estimated on the basis of \nprecipitation and evapotranspiration. Overall, any evapotranspiration \nloss results in reduced flow from springs, which is the principal \nreason many small springs dry up entirely during hot, dry weather.\n    Evapotranspiration is higher for alfalfa in warmer growing regions, \nmeaning that climate change may result in increased groundwater use for \ncontinued alfalfa production in Fish Lake Valley in the future \n(Huntington and Allen 2010, p. 70). In recent decades, reductions in \nwinter precipitation and snowpack have been observed, and this pattern \nis expected to continue (Garfin et al. 2014, p. 465; Marvel et al. \n2023, pp. 11, 22). The frequency and intensity of these reductions have \nincreased on a global scale, and climate change is projected to reduce \nsurface and groundwater resources in most deserts, such as the Great \nBasin (Marvel et al. 2023, p. 25; IPCC 2014, pp. 14, 77).\n\n[[Page 21728]]\n\nInvasive Species\n    Aquatic invasive species have long been demonstrated to have a high \nimpact on range-restricted desert fishes. Invasive species have been \nnoted in the Fish Lake Valley for an extended period of time. Early \nsettlers introduced common carp, bullhead catfish (Ameiurus spp.), \nblack bass, and Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus) to Fish Lake \nand the McNett spring system in the late 19th century (Hubbs 1934, \nunpaginated). Goldfish and sunfish (Lepomis spp.) were introduced to \nFish Lake Valley shortly thereafter (Sada 2024, pers. comm.). By the \nearly 20th century, the populations of tui chubs at both Fish Lake and \nthe McNett spring system were observed to be in decline due to \npredation by introduced fishes (Hubbs 1934, unpaginated). Common carp \nwere observed in Fish Lake and in the ditches draining into the lake \ninto the 1980s and 1990s, and populations of tui chub continued to \ndiminish at both sites (Pedretti et al. 1985b, p. 6; NDOW 1993, p. 1). \nAs the habitat of the tui chub dried, competition with invasive carp \nmay have resulted in larger proportional impacts to the tui chub. \nInvasive bullfrogs became abundant by the early 1990s at Fish Lake, \nsimultaneous with the crash of the tui chub population at that site \n(NDOW 1991, p. 1). At the same time, populations of predatory fish, \nincluding bass and sunfish, contributed additional pressures on the tui \nchub population at Fish Lake (Sada 2024, pers. comm.).\n    As discussed above, goldfish, black bass, and common carp have been \nintroduced in the McNett spring system, although only the goldfish \npersist there today. Currently, invasive species including bullfrogs \nand goldfish are located less than 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the \nMcNett spring system at an artificial well and wetland complex known as \nthe Fish Lake Valley Hot Well or ``Hot Box,'' constructed in the early \n1990s for recreational bathing and fishing opportunities (NDOW 1991, p. \n2). The 2-mile (3-kilometer) proximity of these invasive species \nenhances the risk that flash flooding events will allow them to \ndisperse or be intentionally introduced to the McNett spring system. \nAlternatively, if the Hot Well dried up as a result of water production \nin the valley, the invasive bullfrogs may disperse to the nearest \naquatic habitat, which may include the McNett spring system. \nAdditionally, goldfish and mosquitofish have already been introduced to \nLida Pond, where Fish Lake Valley tui chubs were translocated outside \nof the subspecies' historical range. Lida Pond is especially vulnerable \nto the introduction of additional invasive species because it may be \neasily accessed by public roads and it is very close to Indian Spring, \n6.6 miles (10.7 kilometers) away, where introduced populations of \npredatory American bullfrogs, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), \nand bullhead catfish exist.\n    Overall, the direct impact of invasive species on the Fish Lake \nValley tui chub is difficult to quantify, but in combination with the \ndecline in habitat size and quality due to dewatering, the increased \ncompetition with and predation by invasive species are highly likely to \naffect the Fish Lake Valley tui chub, which evolved without other \nnative fish in Fish Lake Valley (Hubbs 1934, unpaginated).\n\nConservation Efforts and Regulatory Mechanisms\n\n    The Fish Lake Valley tui chub is designated as a protected fish \nspecies by the State of Nevada (Nevada Administrative Code at section \n503.065.1). Protected wildlife species are prohibited from being taken \nor hunted without authorization from NDOW. However, there are no \nprotections for the habitat of protected species or for indirect \nkilling of protected species incidental to otherwise lawful activities. \nNo known conservation actions have been undertaken for Fish Lake Valley \ntui chub (NDOW 2012a, p. 19; West 2024, pers. comm.).\n\nCumulative Effects\n\n    We note that, by using the SSA framework to guide our analysis of \nthe scientific information documented in the SSA report, we have \nanalyzed the cumulative effects of identified threats and conservation \nactions on the Fish Lake Valley tui chub. To assess the current and \nfuture condition of the species, we evaluate the effects of all the \nrelevant factors that may be influencing the species, including threats \nand conservation efforts. The best available science indicates that \nthere are synergistic and cumulative interactions among the factors \ninfluencing the Fish Lake Valley tui chub's viability. The Fish Lake \nValley tui chub is limited to two extremely small populations, one \nwithin the historical range and one introduced outside of the \nhistorical range. Groundwater decline and reduction in spring flow due \nto dewatering associated with current and ongoing projects could cause \nfurther decline in habitat availability in this already limited \nhabitat. Additionally, increased competition with and predation by \ninvasive species would likely further negatively affect the Fish Lake \ntui chub by decreasing the quality of the available habitat. \nCumulatively, these factors diminish the amount of suitable habitat for \nthe Fish Lake Valley tui chub, thus impacting the subspecies' \nviability. Because the SSA framework considers not just the presence of \nthe factors influencing this subspecies, but to what degree they \ncollectively influence risk to the entire subspecies, our assessment \nintegrates the cumulative effects of the factors and replaces a \nstandalone cumulative-effects analysis.\n\nCurrent Condition\n\n    The Fish Lake Valley tui chub is a narrow endemic subspecies known \nfrom six historical sites (see table 2, below) within Fish Lake Valley \nin Esmeralda County, Nevada, and a seventh more recently introduced \nsite outside of the historical range. All but one (McNett spring \nsystem) of the six historical sites are now extirpated. A second \npopulation was introduced at Lida Pond outside of Fish Lake Valley \nroughly 39 miles (63 kilometers) southeast of McNett spring system (see \nfigure 1, below). Both sites are spring-fed systems. The year-round \nflow and relative stability in temperature and water quality provided \nby the springs (e.g., not freezing over in winter) have likely played a \nlarge role in maintaining these populations. Because of the small \nspatial scale (i.e., one extant population within the historical range \nand one introduced population outside the historical range) and limited \nsurvey data, we assessed the current condition qualitatively by \ndiscussing rangewide factors affecting viability (e.g., the number of \nextant sites) and by summarizing the available demographic and habitat \ninformation for each site. We use the terms sites and populations \ninterchangeably given the lack of hydrologic connectivity between \nextant sites; however, the historical population structure is unknown. \nWe supplemented the limited demographic and habitat quality data with a \nthreats analysis for each population. Below, we provide qualitative \ndescriptions of the factors influencing viability and highlight the \nmajor threats and their expected impacts on each of the two extant \nsites. Please refer to the SSA for a full discussion of the extirpated \nFish Lake Valley tui chub sites (Service 2024, pp. 53-61).\n\n[[Page 21729]]\n\n\n\nTable 2--Summary of Current Condition of the Fish Lake Valley Tui Chub at Each Known Site.

Map of Known Fish Lake Valley Tui Chub Occupied and \nExtirpated Sites\n\nMcNett Spring System\n    The McNett spring system is the only extant population of the Fish \nLake Valley tui chub within the subspecies' historical range, and \navailable survey data suggest that this population is currently stable. \nNDOW conducted surveys or visited the McNett spring system in 1998, \n2002, 2005, 2007, 2021, and 2023. Survey methods varied among years, \nranging from visual surveys and dip netting to mark-recapture \npopulation estimates. Population estimates for the main spring pool \nhave ranged between 2,143 and 3,278 tui chubs, although the total \npopulation size throughout the spring complex is likely larger. The \nfirst mark-recapture survey was conducted in 2002, and it estimated a \npopulation of 3,278 chubs at this site, with a 95 percent confidence \ninterval of 1,900-6,145 fish (NDOW 2002, p. 1). In 2005, the population \nwas estimated at 2,210 chubs with a 95 percent confidence interval of \n1,652-3,032 fish (NDOW 2005, p. 1). In 2007, 554 tui chubs were marked \nand released, but a population estimate was not conducted due to \nlogistical constraints (NDOW 2007, p. 1). In 2021, mark-recapture \nsurvey efforts resulted in an estimated population of 2,143 fish with a \n95 percent confidence interval of 1,847-2,485 fish (NDOW 2021, p. 6). \nHowever,\n\n[[Page 21731]]\n\nalthough the population appears to be stable, the limited size of the \nhabitat (210 acres (ac); 85 hectares (ha)) in this one remaining \nhistorical site makes it vulnerable to even small changes in influences \nto viability, especially groundwater availability.\n    Most of the McNett spring system is privately owned and used for \ngrazing cattle. Fencing excludes feral horses from entering the \nproperty from adjacent BLM lands. The main spring pool historically \nmeasured 23 by 17 feet (7 by 5 meters) with a maximum depth of 3 feet \n(1 meter); however, the spring was later impounded, which increased the \ndiameter of the pool to 39.0 feet (11.9 meters) (Pedretti et al. 1985a, \np. 3; NDOW 1991, p. 1; NDOW 2021, p. 4). On March 23, 2021, the depth \nof the main pool was measured at 6.2 feet (1.9 meters), and it had a \nmean temperature of 66.7 [deg]F (19.3 [deg]C) (NDOW 2021, p. 4). \nDissolved oxygen ranged from 4.5 to 5.6 mg/L at three sites sampled \nacross the spring complex, with total dissolved solids ranging from 287 \nto 730 mg/L and conductivity from 404 to 1,081 microsiemens per \ncentimeter ([micro]s/cm) (NDOW 2021, p. 4). Although the main spring \npool contains the highest quality habitat, Fish Lake Valley tui chubs \nare known to disperse throughout the wetland complex.\n    The primary threat to Fish Lake Valley tui chubs at the McNett \nspring system is continued groundwater extraction driven by \nagricultural operations in Fish Lake Valley, which has led to the \ndrying of habitat and extirpation of other tui chub populations \n(Pothole Springs and unnamed spring) within the valley. In 1950, the \nwell had a flow rate of 195 gallons per minute (gpm) (738 liters per \nminute) (Eakin 1950, p. 25), and in 2023 to 2024, the flow rate had \ndecreased to 89 to 91 gpm (337 to 344 liters per minute) (UES \nConsulting Services, Inc. 2024a, p. 9). A numerical groundwater model \npredicted that the McNett spring system will experience a drawdown of \napproximately 5 feet (2 meters) within the next 50 years due primarily \nto existing agricultural pumping within Fish Lake Valley (UES \nConsulting Services, Inc. 2024b, p. 65). This same model predicts a \ntotal reduction in flow of approximately 56 gpm (212 liters per minute) \nwithin 50 years, representing an approximate 22 percent reduction in \nflow (UES Consulting Services, Inc. 2024b, p. 66). There is potential \nfor additional stress on groundwater from the development of nearby \ngeothermal power facilities or lithium mines.\n    Another major threat to this population is the potential \nintroduction of invasive species. American bullfrogs and goldfish are \nwithin 2 miles (3 kilometers) of the McNett spring system, located at a \nconstructed well outflow complex known as the Fish Lake Valley Hot Well \n(NDOW 2020, p. 4). This outflow complex was constructed in the early \n1990s for recreational bathing and fishing opportunities (NDOW 1991, p. \n2). NDOW has previously recommended the eradication of nonnative \nspecies from the Fish Lake Valley Hot Well for the protection of \nendemic aquatic species including the Fish Lake Valley tui chub (NDOW \n1991, p. 2; NDOW 2020, p. 8). Proximate populations of invasive species \ncan spread to nearby tui chub habitat in large flash flooding events, \nwhich may become increasingly common due to anthropogenic climate \nchange. Invasive species may also be deliberately moved by humans to \nsensitive natural habitats for enhanced recreational opportunities. The \ncurrent land management and grazing levels at the McNett spring system \nappear to pose a low risk to the Fish Lake Valley tui chub population, \nas evidenced by the stable tui chub abundance estimates in the main \nspring pool.\nLida Pond\n    Fish Lake Valley tui chubs were first reported and collected at \nLida Pond in 1993 (NDOW 1993, p. 1). Genetic results indicate that the \ntui chubs at Lida Pond are Fish Lake Valley tui chubs (Campbell et al. \n2024, entire). The site is located at the townsite of Lida on BLM land \nadjacent to Timbisha Shoshone Tribal lands. Lida Pond is located \nroughly 4 miles outside of the Fish Lake Valley basin. The best \navailable information suggests that the entire historical range of the \nFish Lake Valley tui chub was restricted to the Fish Lake Valley basin. \nTherefore, the population of Fish Lake Valley tui chub at Lida Pond is \noutside the subspecies' historical range, likely introduced by humans \nalthough details about the introduction are unknown.\n    No estimates of population size are available for Lida Pond, but 22 \nFish Lake Valley tui chubs were collected in 30 minutes of trapping in \n2022 (NDOW 2022, p. 1). Presence of tui chubs in Lida Pond was \nconfirmed in 2023 and 2024, based on visual surveys by NDOW, BLM, NDNH, \nand Service biologists, suggesting that the population has been extant \nat this site since 1993. It is unknown if the tui chub population at \nLida Pond has persisted since the original introduction or if \nadditional introductions of tui chub were made in subsequent years. \nLida Pond is a natural spring that has been modified with an earthen \nberm to create a larger pond. No information is available on habitat \nquality within Lida Pond (NDOW 2023, p. 10).\n    Current threats to the tui chub population at Lida Pond include \ncompetition from goldfish present in the pond and the spread of \nemergent vegetation, mainly cattails (Typha sp.), which can limit \navailable open water habitat at the pond. Mosquitofish (Gambusia spp.) \nwere first observed in the pond by Service and NDOW biologists in 2012 \n(NDOW 2012b, p. 3) and were observed to be the most abundant fish in \nthe pond in 2022 (NDOW 2022, p. 1). Competition with these two species \n(goldfish and mosquitofish) is likely having a small effect on the Fish \nLake Valley tui chub; however, as described in ``Invasive Species,'' \nabove, competition can exacerbate other threats. In addition, Lida Pond \nis especially vulnerable to the introduction of additional invasive \nspecies because it may be easily accessed by public roads, and invasive \nspecies, especially those valued for recreational fishing (e.g., \nlargemouth bass), have potential to be intentionally introduced.\n    The risk of groundwater depletion leading to desiccation of the \nspring at Lida Pond is lower relative to sites within Fish Lake Valley. \nIn addition to being in a different groundwater basin, Lida Pond is \nmore than 6,100 feet (1,860 meters) above sea level while the McNett \nspring system, which is on the Fish Lake Valley floor, is approximately \n4,700 feet (1,433 meters) above sea level. Thus, Lida Pond is a farther \ndistance from agricultural operations and has a cooler climate with \nreduced evapotranspiration (Nevada Division of Water Resources 2023, p. \n15).\nSummary of Current Condition\n    The Fish Lake Valley tui chub is a narrow endemic subspecies known \nfrom six historical sites within Fish Lake Valley in Esmeralda County, \nNevada. All but one of the six historical sites are now extirpated due \nto drying of the aquatic habitat. A second population has been \nintroduced at Lida Pond outside of the subspecies' historical range. \nThe one extant population within Fish Lake Valley (McNett spring \nsystem) has remained stable at roughly 2,000 individuals (95 percent \nconfidence interval of 1,652-6,145 individuals) for two decades. \nAlthough this observed stability suggests that this population has \nhistorically had some resilience to threats such as invasive species \nand local land management practices, the primary concern is risk of a \ncatastrophic loss of aquatic habitat similar to the loss of Fish Lake \nand surrounding springs\n\n[[Page 21732]]\n\n(this loss is discussed under ``Agricultural Production,'' above).\n    Although the historical population structure is not known, there \nhas been a large decrease in redundancy and representation due to the \ndrying of Fish Lake and the surrounding water bodies. Resiliency of the \nFish Lake Valley tui chub has been reduced such that the subspecies \noccurs in only a single population within its historical range (McNett \nspring system) and an introduced location outside its historical range \n(Lida Pond). The loss of redundancy has left each remaining population \nvulnerable to catastrophic threats. For example, the extirpation of the \nhistorical populations has reduced the connectivity among the two \npopulations such that they cannot disperse from either drying of the \nspring or the introduction of an invasive competitor or predator, nor \ncan they recolonize after a catastrophic event has taken place.\n    Representation has been reduced through the loss of connectivity \nand loss of habitat types, which have reduced the evolutionary \npotential. These losses compromise the ability of the subspecies to \nadapt to novel changes in the environment, which increases the risk of \nextinction. Because the threats that have impacted populations in the \npast have not been abated, continued groundwater declines and the \nintroduction of invasive species both present a high risk to the \ncurrent viability of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub.\n\nFuture Condition\n\n    As part of the SSA, we also developed two future-condition \nscenarios to capture the range of uncertainties regarding future \nthreats and the projected responses by the Fish Lake Valley tui chub. \nOur scenarios assumed continued or enhanced groundwater declines, \noccurrence of mining operations extracting groundwater, occurrence of \ngeothermal operations decreasing surface water expression, presence of \ninvasive species leading to extirpation of Fish Lake Valley tui chub, a \nhigher emission scenario (shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP)5-8.5 or \nRCP8.5) or a lower emission scenario (SSP2-4.5 or RCP4.5), and status \nquo and alternative property management changes. Because we determined \nthat the current condition of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub is \nconsistent with an endangered species (see Determination of Fish Lake \nValley Tui Chub's Status, below), we are not presenting the results of \nthe future scenarios in this proposed rule. Please refer to the SSA \nreport (Service 2024, pp. 56-60) for the full analysis of future \nscenarios.\n\nDetermination of Fish Lake Valley Tui Chub's Status\n\n    The Act defines a species as including any subspecies of fish or \nwildlife or plants, and any distinct population segment of any species \nof vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature. Section 4 \nof the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and its implementing regulations (50 CFR \npart 424) set forth the procedures for determining whether a species \nmeets the definition of an endangered species or a threatened species. \nThe Act defines an ``endangered species'' as a species in danger of \nextinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range and a \n``threatened species'' as a species likely to become an endangered \nspecies within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant \nportion of its range. The Act requires that we determine whether a \nspecies meets the definition of an endangered species or a threatened \nspecies because of any of the following factors: (A) The present or \nthreatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or \nrange; (B) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or \neducational purposes; (C) disease or predation; (D) the inadequacy of \nexisting regulatory mechanisms; or (E) other natural or manmade factors \naffecting its continued existence.\n\nStatus Throughout All of Its Range\n\n    After evaluating threats to the subspecies and assessing the \ncumulative effect of the threats under the Act's section 4(a)(1) \nfactors, we find that the viability of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub is \ncurrently at risk. Our analysis revealed several threats that have \ncaused the Fish Lake Valley tui chub's range to become greatly reduced, \nresulting in the majority of its historical habitat becoming \nuninhabitable. The most important factors affecting the subspecies' \ncurrent status and trend are the destruction and modification of its \naquatic habitat caused by agricultural production or other land \nmanagement practices (Factor A), effects of climate change (i.e., \nwarmer temperatures and greater extremes in precipitation amounts) on \naquatic habitat availability (Factor A), and predation by and \ncompetition with invasive species (Factors C and E).\n    The primary threat affecting the Fish Lake Valley tui chub \ncurrently is the loss of aquatic habitat driven by both diversion of \nsurface water and declines in groundwater levels. This reduction in \navailable water within Fish Lake Valley has historically been driven by \nagricultural use, which has led to the drying of Fish Lake and the \nsmall streams that historically fed the lake. Pressure on limited \ngroundwater resources from changes in habitat management is expected to \nincrease in the near-term future. Springs in Fish Lake Valley are fed \nby aquifers dependent on snowmelt for recharge. In recent decades, \nclimate change has reduced precipitation and winter snowpack, and \nthereby has affected groundwater levels in the valley. In combination, \nthese threats are expected to increase the risk that the limited \nremaining tui chub habitat within Fish Lake Valley (McNett spring \nsystem) will become dry.\n    Although a complete loss of aquatic habitat is the primary concern, \ndecreases in available habitat exacerbate the other threats affecting \nthe Fish Lake Valley tui chub. Predation by and competition with \ninvasive species have likely contributed to extirpations of historical \ntui chub populations, especially in Fish Lake, and invasive species \nremain a risk for the two extant populations of the Fish Lake Valley \ntui chub. Fish Lake Valley tui chubs currently compete with goldfish \nand mosquitofish in Lida Pond. The proximity of invasive predators, \nsuch as American bullfrogs and largemouth bass, means there is a high \nrisk of these predator species becoming introduced and having \ncatastrophic impacts on one or both of the extant Fish Lake Valley tui \nchub populations. Although the direct impact of invasive species on the \nFish Lake Valley tui chub is difficult to quantify, the increased \ncompetition with and predation by nonnative, invasive species are \nconsiderable current threats to the Fish Lake Valley tui chub.\n    Resiliency of the Fish Lake Valley tui chub has been reduced such \nthat the subspecies occurs in only a single population within its \nhistorical range (McNett spring system). The five other historical \npopulations have been extirpated due to the threats outlined above. The \nsubspecies also occurs in an introduced location outside its historical \nrange (Lida Pond). Both extant sites currently face significant \nimminent threats, including groundwater decline (McNett spring system) \nand invasive species (McNett spring system and Lida Pond). The \nreduction in the subspecies' range (from six sites to one within the \nhistorical range) has also reduced redundancy and representation. Both \nthe McNett spring system and Lida Pond are at risk of catastrophic \nevents associated with the current threats to the subspecies. The loss \nof habitat and\n\n[[Page 21733]]\n\nconnectivity across the subspecies' historical range due to the drying \nof Fish Lake has resulted in loss of evolutionary potential and \nadaptive capacity for the Fish Lake Valley tui chub. Due to reduced \nresiliency, representation, and redundancy, the Fish Lake Valley tui \nchub is at risk of extinction in the near-term future.\n    Thus, after assessing the best scientific and commercial data \navailable, we determine that the Fish Lake Valley tui chub is in danger \nof extinction throughout all of its range. We do not find that the Fish \nLake Valley tui chub meets the Act's definition of a threatened species \nbecause the Fish Lake Valley tui chub has already shown low levels in \ncurrent resiliency, redundancy, and representation due to the threats \ndiscussed above.\n\nStatus Throughout a Significant Portion of Its Range\n\n    Under the Act and our implementing regulations, a species may \nwarrant listing if it is in danger of extinction or likely to become so \nwithin the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion \nof its range. We have determined that the Fish Lake Valley tui chub is \nin danger of extinction throughout all of its range and accordingly did \nnot undertake an analysis of any significant portion of its range. \nBecause the Fish Lake Valley tui chub warrants listing as endangered \nthroughout all of its range, our determination does not conflict with \nthe decision in Center for Biological Diversity v. Everson, 435 F. \nSupp. 3d 69 (D.D.C. 2020), because that decision related to significant \nportion of the range analyses for species that warrant listing as \nthreatened, not endangered, throughout all of their range.\n\nDetermination of Status\n\n    Based on the best scientific and commercial data available, we \ndetermine that the Fish Lake Valley tui chub meets the Act's definition \nof an endangered species. Therefore, we propose to list the Fish Lake \nValley tui chub as an endangered species in accordance with sections \n3(6) and 4(a)(1) of the Act.\n\nAvailable Conservation Measures\n\n    Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or \nthreatened species under the Act include recognition as a listed \nspecies, planning and implementation of recovery actions, requirements \nfor Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. \nRecognition through listing results in public awareness, and \nconservation by Federal, State, Tribal, and local agencies, foreign \ngovernments, private organizations, and individuals. The Act encourages \ncooperation with the States and other countries and calls for recovery \nactions to be carried out for listed species. The protection required \nby Federal agencies, including the Service, and the prohibitions \nagainst certain activities are discussed, in part, below.\n    The primary purpose of the Act is the conservation of endangered \nand threatened species and the ecosystems upon which they depend. The \nultimate goal of such conservation efforts is the recovery of these \nlisted species, so that they no longer need the protective measures of \nthe Act. Section 4(f) of the Act calls for the Service to develop and \nimplement recovery plans for the conservation of endangered and \nthreatened species. The goal of this process is to restore listed \nspecies to a point where they are secure, self-sustaining, and \nfunctioning components of their ecosystems.\n    The recovery planning process begins with development of a recovery \noutline made available to the public soon after a final listing \ndetermination. The recovery outline guides the immediate implementation \nof urgent recovery actions while a recovery plan is being developed. \nRecovery teams (composed of species experts, Federal and State \nagencies, nongovernmental organizations, and stakeholders) may be \nestablished to develop and implement recovery plans. The recovery \nplanning process involves the identification of actions that are \nnecessary to halt and reverse the species' decline by addressing the \nthreats to its survival and recovery. The recovery plan identifies \nrecovery criteria for review of when a species may be ready for \nreclassification from endangered to threatened (``downlisting'') or \nremoval from protected status (``delisting''), and methods for \nmonitoring recovery progress. Recovery plans also establish a framework \nfor agencies to coordinate their recovery efforts and provide estimates \nof the cost of implementing recovery tasks. Revisions of the plan may \nbe done to address continuing or new threats to the species, as new \nsubstantive information becomes available. The recovery outline, draft \nrecovery plan, final recovery plan, and any revisions will be available \non our website as they are completed (<a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/program/endangered-species\">https://www.fws.gov/program/endangered-species</a>) or from our Reno Fish and Wildlife Office (see FOR \nFURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT).\n    Implementation of recovery actions generally requires the \nparticipation of a broad range of partners, including other Federal \nagencies, States, Tribes, nongovernmental organizations, businesses, \nand private landowners. Examples of recovery actions include habitat \nrestoration (e.g., restoration of native vegetation), research, captive \npropagation and reintroduction, and outreach and education. The \nrecovery of many listed species cannot be accomplished solely on \nFederal lands because their range may occur primarily or solely on non-\nFederal lands. To achieve recovery of these species requires \ncooperative conservation efforts on private, State, and Tribal lands.\n    If the Fish Lake Valley tui chub is listed, funding for recovery \nactions may be available from a variety of sources, including Federal \nbudgets, State programs, and cost-share grants for non-Federal \nlandowners, the academic community, and nongovernmental organizations. \nIn addition, pursuant to section 6 of the Act, the State of Nevada \nwould be eligible for Federal funds to implement management actions \nthat promote the protection or recovery of the Fish Lake Valley tui \nchub. Information on our grant programs that are available to aid \nspecies recovery can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/service/financial-assistance\">https://www.fws.gov/service/financial-assistance</a>.\n    Although the Fish Lake Valley tui chub is only proposed for listing \nunder the Act at this time, please let us know if you are interested in \nparticipating in recovery efforts for this subspecies. Additionally, we \ninvite you to submit any new information on this subspecies whenever it \nbecomes available and any information you may have for recovery \nplanning purposes (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT).\n    Section 7 of the Act is titled, ``Interagency Cooperation,'' and it \nmandates all Federal action agencies to use their existing authorities \nto further the conservation purposes of the Act and to ensure that \ntheir actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of \nlisted species or adversely modify critical habitat. Regulations \nimplementing section 7 are codified at 50 CFR part 402.\n    Section 7(a)(2) states that each Federal action agency shall, in \nconsultation with the Secretary, ensure that any action they authorize, \nfund, or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence \nof a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse \nmodification of designated critical habitat. Each Federal agency shall \nreview its action at the earliest possible time to determine whether it \nmay affect listed species or critical habitat. If a determination is \nmade that the action may affect listed species or critical habitat, \nformal consultation is required (50 CFR\n\n[[Page 21734]]\n\n402.14(a)), unless the Service concurs in writing that the action is \nnot likely to adversely affect listed species or critical habitat. At \nthe end of a formal consultation, the Service issues a biological \nopinion, containing its determination of whether the Federal action is \nlikely to result in jeopardy or adverse modification.\n    In contrast, section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies \nto confer with the Service on any action which is likely to jeopardize \nthe continued existence of any species proposed to be listed under the \nAct or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical \nhabitat proposed to be designated for such species. Although the \nconference procedures are required only when an action is likely to \nresult in jeopardy or adverse modification, action agencies may \nvoluntarily confer with the Service on actions that may affect species \nproposed for listing or critical habitat proposed to be designated. In \nthe event that the subject species is listed or the relevant critical \nhabitat is designated, a conference opinion may be adopted as a \nbiological opinion and serve as compliance with section 7(a)(2) of the \nAct.\n    Examples of discretionary actions for the Fish Lake Valley tui chub \nthat may be subject to conference and consultation procedures under \nsection 7 are management of Federal lands administered by the BLM, as \nwell as actions that require a Federal permit (such as a permit from \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Clean Water \nAct (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.)) or actions funded by Federal agencies \nsuch as the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Aviation \nAdministration, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Federal \nactions not affecting listed species or critical habitat--and actions \non State, Tribal, local, or private lands that are not federally \nfunded, authorized, or carried out by a Federal agency--do not require \nsection 7 consultation. Federal agencies should coordinate with the \nReno Fish and Wildlife Office (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT) \nwith any specific questions on section 7 consultation and conference \nrequirements.\n    The Act and its implementing regulations set forth a series of \nprohibitions and exceptions that apply to endangered wildlife. The \nprohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the Act, and the Service's \nimplementing regulations codified at 50 CFR 17.21, make it illegal for \nany person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to commit, \nto attempt to commit, to solicit another to commit, or to cause to be \ncommitted any of the following acts with regard to any endangered \nwildlife: (1) import into, or export from, the United States; (2) take \n(which includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, \ncapture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct) \nwithin the United States, within the territorial sea of the United \nStates, or on the high seas; (3) possess, sell, deliver, carry, \ntransport, or ship, by any means whatsoever, any such wildlife that has \nbeen taken illegally; (4) deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship \nin interstate or foreign commerce, by any means whatsoever and in the \ncourse of commercial activity; or (5) sell or offer for sale in \ninterstate or foreign commerce. Certain exceptions to these \nprohibitions apply to employees or agents of the Service, the National \nMarine Fisheries Service, other Federal land management agencies, and \nState conservation agencies.\n    We may issue permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities \ninvolving endangered wildlife under certain circumstances. Regulations \ngoverning permits for endangered wildlife are codified at 50 CFR 17.22, \nand general Service permitting regulations are codified at 50 CFR part \n13. With regard to endangered wildlife, a permit may be issued for: \nscientific purposes, enhancing the propagation or survival of the \nspecies, or take incidental to otherwise lawful activities. The statute \nalso contains certain exemptions from the prohibitions, which are found \nin sections 9 and 10 of the Act.\n\nII. Critical Habitat\n\n    Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent \nprudent and determinable, we designate a species' critical habitat \nconcurrently with listing the species. Critical habitat is defined in \nsection 3(5)(A) of the Act as:\n    (1) The specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the \nspecies, at the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which \nare found those physical or biological features\n    (a) Essential to the conservation of the species, and\n    (b) Which may require special management considerations or \nprotection; and\n    (2) Specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the \nspecies at the time it is listed, upon a determination that such areas \nare essential for the conservation of the species.\n    Our regulations at 50 CFR 424.12(a)(2) state that critical habitat \nis not determinable when one or both of the following situations exist: \n(i) Data sufficient to perform required analyses are lacking, or (ii) \nthe biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to \nidentify any area that meets the definition of ``critical habitat.'' We \nreviewed the available information pertaining to the biological needs \nof the Fish Lake Valley tui chub and the habitat characteristics where \nthis subspecies is located. A careful assessment of the economic \nimpacts that may occur due to a critical habitat designation is still \nongoing. Therefore, due to the current lack of data sufficient to \nperform required analyses, we conclude that the designation of critical \nhabitat for the Fish Lake Valley tui chub is not determinable at this \ntime. The Act allows the Service an additional year to publish a \ncritical habitat designation that is not determinable at the time of \nlisting (16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(6)(C)(ii)).\n\nRequired Determinations\n\nClarity of the Rule\n\n    We are required by E.O.s 12866 and 12988 and by the Presidential \nMemorandum of June 1, 1998, to write all rules in plain language. This \nmeans that each rule we publish must:\n    (1) Be logically organized;\n    (2) Use the active voice to address readers directly;\n    (3) Use clear language rather than jargon;\n    (4) Be divided into short sections and sentences; and\n    (5) Use lists and tables wherever possible.\n    If you feel that we have not met these requirements, send us \ncomments by one of the methods listed in ADDRESSES. To better help us \nrevise the rule, your comments should be as specific as possible. For \nexample, you should tell us the numbers of the sections or paragraphs \nthat are unclearly written, which sections or sentences are too long, \nthe sections where you feel lists or tables would be useful, etc.\n\nGovernment-to-Government Relations With Native American Tribal \nGovernments\n\n    In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994 \n(Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal \nGovernments; 59 FR 22951, May 4, 1994), E.O. 13175 (Consultation and \nCoordination with Indian Tribal Governments), the President's \nmemorandum of November 30, 2022 (Uniform Standards for Tribal \nConsultation; 87 FR 74479, December 5, 2022), and the Department of the \nInterior's manual at 512 DM 2, we\n\n[[Page 21735]]\n\nreadily acknowledge our responsibility to communicate meaningfully with \nfederally recognized Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations on a \ngovernment-to-government basis. In accordance with Secretary's Order \n3206 of June 5, 1997 (American Indian Tribal Rights, Federal-Tribal \nTrust Responsibilities, and the Endangered Species Act), we readily \nacknowledge our responsibilities to work directly with Tribes in \ndeveloping programs for healthy ecosystems, to acknowledge that Tribal \nlands are not subject to the same controls as Federal public lands, to \nremain sensitive to Indian culture, and to make information available \nto Tribes. The Fish Lake Valley tui chub does not occur on any land \nowned by Tribal entities. However, the Lida Pond site is adjacent to \nland owned by the Timbisha Shoshone. As part of the development of the \nSSA, a letter requesting information regarding the status of the \nsubspecies and any existing management or conservation efforts was sent \nto the Timbisha Shoshone, the Yomba Shoshone, and the Bishop Paiute \nTribes. We will continue to work with relevant Tribal entities during \nthe development of any final rules for the Fish Lake Valley tui chub.\n\nReferences Cited\n\n    A complete list of references cited in this proposed rule is \navailable on the internet at <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</a> and upon \nrequest from the Reno Fish and Wildlife Office (see FOR FURTHER \nINFORMATION CONTACT).\n\nList of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 17\n\n    Endangered and threatened species, Exports, Imports, Plants, \nReporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation, Wildlife.\n\nSigning Authority\n\n    Paul Souza, Regional Director, Region 8, Exercising the Delegated \nAuthority of the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \napproved this action on May 6, 2025, for publication.
